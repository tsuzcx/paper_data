The frequency range of the ripples is much higher than the bandwidth of current control. Therefore the control is performed on the basis of a fundamental current component, i.e. average value with the averaging time being the PWM period. In majority of cases the average current is measured without low-pass filtering, with the use of Regular Sampling method. The method enables extraction of the current fundamental component by sampling current instantaneous value once in a PWM period, synchronously with peaks or valleys of PWM carrier signal. Regular Sampling is widely used in industry in combination with field-oriented motor control algorithms. In such a case motor flux and torque are controlled by current components expressed in a rotating reference frame d-q. The feedback signals for current controllers are calculated on the basis of sampled motor phase currents, with the use of Clarke and Park transformations. However, transforming samples of average phase currents into the rotating reference frame does not result in exact values of average d- and q- current components. This influences motor torque and flux. The error reaches considerable values in high-speed drives operating at relatively low PWM frequency. The value of the error was derived analytically, followed by simulation verification.","doi":"10.1109/ICEPE.2014.6970042","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEPE.2014.6970042","startPage":"901","endPage":"905","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference and Exposition on Electrical and Power Engineering (EPE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963815/6969853/06970042.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference and Exposition on Electrical and Power Engineering (EPE)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6969853","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error analysis of calculating average d-q current components using regular sampling and Park transformation in FOC drives","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Error analysis of calculating average d-q current components using regular sampling and Park transformation in FOC drives","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6970042/","accessionNumber":"14791801","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6970042/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error analysis of calculating average d-q current components using regular sampling and Park transformation in FOC drives","confLoc":"Iasi, Romania","sourcePdf":"PEED549.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044992S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963815","isNumber":"6969853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963815","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6969853","articleId":"6970042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6970056,"authors":[{"name":"Ovidiu Ivanov","affiliation":["Power System Department, \u201cGheorghe Asachi\u201d Technical University, Iasi, Romania"],"firstName":"Ovidiu","lastName":"Ivanov","id":"37536106200"},{"name":"Mihai Gavrila\u015f","affiliation":["Power System Department, \u201cGheorghe Asachi\u201d Technical University, Iasi, Romania"],"firstName":"Mihai","lastName":"Gavrila\u015f","id":"37352966400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5849-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6970056","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6970056","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phasor measurement units","Voltage measurement","Artificial neural networks","Neurons","Measurement uncertainty","State estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer perceptrons","phasor measurement","power engineering computing","state estimation","transmission networks","voltage measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["angle measurements","PMU voltage magnitude measurement","multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks","voltage angle measurements","system-wide synchronized phasor measurement units","HV transmission networks","PMU voltage measurement","state estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["state estimation","artificial neural networks","phasor measurement units"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICEPE.2014.6970056","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963815/6969853/06970056.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference and Exposition on Electrical and Power Engineering (EPE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference and Exposition on Electrical and Power Engineering (EPE)","startPage":"983","endPage":"988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6969853","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEPE.2014.6970056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"State estimation with Neural Networks and PMU voltage measurements","abstract":"State estimation is used currently in wide area electrical systems for real time analysis.

Among the main reported approaches, inductive links are the most commonly used method for remote powering of such devices. Power efficiency is the most important characteristic to be considered when designing inductive links to transfer energy to implantable devices. The maximum power efficiency is obtained for maximum coupling and quality factors of the coils and is generally limited as the coupling between the inductors is usually very small. This paper is dealing with geometry optimization of inductively coupled printed spiral coils for the powering of a given implant system. For this aim, simple mathematical models that approximate coil parameters and link efficiency are derived, and using these models two different approaches are used to provide optimal coil geometries for a maximum efficiency of the link. First an iterative design procedure is implemented then genetic based algorithm optimisation is derived to find the optimal coil geometries of the used coil structure. Theoretical results are verified by simulation using HFSS software. A comparative analysis confirmed the effectiveness of the genetic algorithm based approach to provide the optimal coil geometries.","doi":"10.1109/GSCIT.2014.6970124","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Global Summit on Computer & Information Technology (GSCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6962872/6970090/06970124.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 Global Summit on Computer & Information Technology (GSCIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GSCIT.2014.6970124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6970090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithm based geometry optimization of inductively coupled printed spiral coils for remote powering of electronic implantable devices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Coils","Skin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electronics","coils","genetic algorithms","geometry","inductors","prosthetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm based geometry optimization","inductively coupled printed spiral coils","remote powering","electronic biomedical implantable devices","inductive links","transfer energy","maximum power efficiency","maximum coupling","quality factors","inductors","implant system","mathematical models","link efficiency","optimal coil geometries","iterative design procedure","genetic based algorithm optimisation","coil structure","HFSS software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["inductive link","iterative design procedure","genetic algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6970124/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 June 2014","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm based geometry optimization of inductively coupled printed spiral coils for remote powering of electronic implantable devices","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6970124/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","conferenceDate":"14-16 June 2014","accessionNumber":"14805747","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm based geometry optimization of inductively coupled printed spiral coils for remote powering of electronic implantable devices","confLoc":"Sousse, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"PID3076433.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065358S","chronDate":"14-16 June 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6962872","isNumber":"6970090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6962872","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6970090","articleId":"6970124","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6970173,"authors":[{"name":"Adam Jatowt","affiliation":["Japan Science and Technology Agency, Tokyo, Japan","Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Jatowt","id":"37586513400"},{"name":"Kevin Duh","affiliation":["Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Duh","id":"37085579191"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5569-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6970173","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":636},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Context","Vectors","Abstracts","Sparse matrices","Cultural differences","Vocabulary","Time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","history","natural language processing","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semantic change analysis","historical texts","language evolution","exploratory analysis","change visualization","contrastive-pair level","sentiment orientation level","NLP approaches","word evolution","diachronic corpora","historical language corpora"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["language change","word meaning evolution","historical linguistics","computational etymology"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JCDL.2014.6970173","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6970173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCDL.2014.6970173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6970138","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Joint Conference on Digital Libraries","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Joint Conference on Digital Libraries","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963755/6970138/06970173.pdf","startPage":"229","endPage":"238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A framework for analyzing semantic change of words across time","abstract":"Recently, large amounts of historical texts have been digitized and made accessible to the public.

In this paper, we study altmetrics on the article and journal levels, investigating whether the online attention received by research articles is related to scholarly impact or may be due to other factors. We define a new metric, Journal Social Impact (JSI), based on eleven data sources: CiteULike, Mendeley, F1000, blogs, Twitter, Facebook, mainstream news outlets, Google Plus, Pinterest, Reddit, and sites running Stack Exchange (Q&A). We compare JSI against diverse citation-based metrics, and find that JSI significantly correlates with a number of them. These findings indicate that online attention of scholarly articles is related to traditional journal rankings and favors journals with a longer history of scholarly impact. We also find that journal-level altmetrics have strong significant correlations among themselves, compared with the weak correlations among article-level altmetrics. Another finding is that Mendeley and Twitter have the highest usage and coverage of scholarly activities. Among individual altmetrics, we find that the readership of academic social networks have the highest correlations with citation-based metrics. Our findings deepen the overall understanding of altmetrics and can assist in validating them.","doi":"10.1109/JCDL.2014.6970193","startPage":"375","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Joint Conference on Digital Libraries","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Joint Conference on Digital Libraries","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963755/6970138/06970193.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCDL.2014.6970193","endPage":"378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6970138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Do altmetrics follow the crowd or does the crowd follow altmetrics?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6970193/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Do altmetrics follow the crowd or does the crowd follow altmetrics?","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6970193/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14791164","conferenceDate":"8-12 Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Do altmetrics follow the crowd or does the crowd follow altmetrics?","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"jcdl2014paper150.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069758S","chronDate":"8-12 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963755","isNumber":"6970138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963755","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6970138","articleId":"6970193","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6970402,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Qiao","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Electronic & Information Engineering, China University of Mining & Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37085393805"},{"name":"Feng Yang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Electronic & Information Engineering, China University of Mining & Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37634235700"},{"name":"Xianlei Xu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Coal Resources and Safe Mining, China University of Mining & Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xianlei","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085377193"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6789-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6970402","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":290},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Educational institutions","Moisture","Geology","Image reconstruction","Biomedical imaging","Chemistry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ground penetrating radar","moisture","radar computing","radial basis function networks","regression analysis","soil"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["prediction method","soil moisture content","multiple regression","RBF neural network","field repair","ground penetrating radar","radial basis function neural network","GPR data","active components"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GPR","soil moisture content","multiple regression","RBF neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6970402","abstract":"In the application of the field repair in the countryside, determination of the moisture content is very important.

Firstly, we measured the moisture content by experiments and compared the information in GPR data. Secondly, we use multiple regression analysis to get the active components affecting the moisture content in GPR data. Through utilizing the active components and the soil moisture content, we can train RBF neural network. Finally, optimize and record the network.

Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the validity of the analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6970439/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2014-July 4 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 June-4 July 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6970439/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14805721","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On polar sampling of GPR for tunneling boring machine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On polar sampling of GPR for tunneling boring machine","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"Paper63.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04339S","chronDate":"June 30 2014-July 4 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6962870","isNumber":"6970371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6962870","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6970371","articleId":"6970439","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6970484,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Recently, an amplitude analysis was introduced that was able to identify continuous low-velocity waveguides between boreholes already in the measured data. Here, we extend this approach by investigating synthetic data for continuous and discontinuous waveguides in more detail. We found that discontinuous waveguides show characteristic wave propagation behavior causing late arrival high amplitude spreading in the data. The amplitude analysis was able to detect the waveguide and the boundaries at the borehole where the waveguide is present, and the intensity of the spreading can be used to quantitatively estimate the extend of the waveguide into the domain. Applying the amplitude analysis and full-waveform inversion to crosshole GPR data from the Boise Hydrogeophysical Research Site, we were able to detect two discontinuous waveguide caused by changes in porosity (validated by porosity logs), that were confirmed by the full-waveform inversion results that provided a detailed image of the waveguides between the wells.","doi":"10.1109/ICGPR.2014.6970484","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICGPR.2014.6970484","startPage":"552","endPage":"555","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Ground Penetrating Radar","pdfPath":"/iel7/6962870/6970371/06970484.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Ground Penetrating Radar","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6970371","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of low-velocity waveguides in crosshole GPR data using amplitude analysis and full-waveform inversion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2014-July 4 2014","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of low-velocity waveguides in crosshole GPR data using amplitude analysis and full-waveform inversion","conferenceDate":"30 June-4 July 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6970484/","accessionNumber":"14790711","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6970484/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of low-velocity waveguides in crosshole GPR data using amplitude analysis and full-waveform inversion","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"paper105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043097S","chronDate":"June 30 2014-July 4 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6962870","isNumber":"6970371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6962870","xplore-issue":"6970371","articleId":"6970484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6970512,"authors":[{"name":"A.

For impulse GPR systems that utilize the successive sampling technique to acquire radar data, the presence of deterministic timing jitter in the sampling electronics will warp traces along the time axis in a nonlinear manner. Not only does this warping negatively affect subsurface target depth measurements, but it can also reduce the performance of more sophisticated signal processing methods, such as inversion, that rely on accurate wavelet shape. This paper presents an algorithm that can be used to reverse the effects of nonlinear sampling by dewarping the time axis of the GPR data. The algorithm has been tested with a GPR system that exhibits clear symptoms of nonlinear sampling characteristics. The results show that the nonlinear timing effects in GPR data due to deterministic timing jitter can be significantly minimized using this method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6970512/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2014-July 4 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 June-4 July 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6970512/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14790687","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Time dewarping to reduce nonlinear sampling effects of GPR","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time dewarping to reduce nonlinear sampling effects of GPR","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"paper131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042974S","chronDate":"June 30 2014-July 4 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6962870","isNumber":"6970371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6962870","xplore-issue":"6970371","articleId":"6970512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6970528,"authors":[{"name":"H.

One of the solutions is to develop the mobile devices that can deal with local traffic directly instead of conveying data through a base station. Then, the mobile devices act in a way that they can meet either infrastructure or ad hoc D2D mode communications requirements. This paper aims to design joint operation protocol of the routing control and group key agreement based on the idea that the dual operation of infrastructure and ad hoc D2D mode communications in the same wireless device requires the ad hoc node to rely on the network layer function as small as possible. In this paper, we propose the ad hoc D2D protocol to control the ad hoc D2D network and manage the group key in self-organized group of ad hoc nodes based on their home IP addresses wherever they move. Finally, this paper analyzes the latency time for the group key agreement process, which can show the tolerable size of the ad hoc network running with the group key agreement process.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ad hoc networks","Routing","Peer-to-peer computing","Protocols","Wireless communication","Communication system security","IP networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","mobile ad hoc networks","mobility management (mobile radio)","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["routing control","group key management","5G ad hoc D2D networks","5G wireless devices","Internet traffic","mobile devices","local traffic","ad hoc D2D mode communications","protocol","group key agreement","dual operation","wireless device","ad hoc node","network layer function","ad hoc D2D protocol","ad hoc D2D network","home IP addresses"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ad hoc D2D networks","5G networks","Group key agreement","Group key agreement latency","Secure routing control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PRISMS.2014.6970602","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Privacy and Security in Mobile Systems (PRISMS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Privacy and Security in Mobile Systems (PRISMS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963210/6970591/06970602.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6970591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PRISMS.2014.6970602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint operation of routing control and group key management for 5G ad hoc D2D networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6970602","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint operation of routing control and group key management for 5G ad hoc D2D networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6970602/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6970602/","accessionNumber":"14790903","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint operation of routing control and group key management for 5G ad hoc D2D networks","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"1569923891.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047786S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963210","isNumber":"6970591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963210","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6970591","articleId":"6970602","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6970650,"authors":[{"name":"Tuan Tu Tran","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Informatik, Johannes Gutenberg-Universit\u00e4t Mainz, Mainz, Germany"],"firstName":"Tuan Tu","lastName":"Tran","id":"37085429090"},{"name":"Simon Schindel","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Informatik, Johannes Gutenberg-Universit\u00e4t Mainz, Mainz, Germany"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Schindel","id":"37085569258"},{"name":"Yongchao Liu","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Informatik, Johannes Gutenberg-Universit\u00e4t Mainz, Mainz, Germany"],"firstName":"Yongchao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37577992400"},{"name":"Bertil Schmidt","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Informatik, Johannes Gutenberg-Universit\u00e4t Mainz, Mainz, Germany"],"firstName":"Bertil","lastName":"Schmidt","id":"37271057300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6905-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-6533"}],"articleNumber":"6970650","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"abstract":"Bit-parallel pattern matching encodes calculated values in bit arrays. This approach gains its efficiency by performing multiple updates within a machine word. An important parameter is therefore the machine word size (e.g. 32 or 64 bits). With the increasing length of vector registers, the efficient mapping of bit-parallel pattern matching algorithms onto modern high performance computing architectures is becoming increasingly important. In this paper, we investigate an efficient implementation of the Wu-Manber approximate pattern matching algorithm on the Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor. This architecture features a 512-bit long vector processing unit (VPU) as well as a large number of processing cores. We present two mappings of the Wu-Manber algorithm based on auto-vectorization and intrinsics, respectively. Our evaluation shows that the intrinsic approach yields higher performance and gains a speedup of around two orders-of-magnitude compared to a serial CPU version.

Both programming models provide a C-based programming language to write accelerator kernels and a host API used to glue the host and kernel parts. Although this model is a clear improvement over a low-level and ad-hoc programming model for each hardware accelerator, it is still too complex and cumbersome for general adoption. For large and complex applications using several accelerators, the main problem becomes the explicit coordination and management of resources required between the host and the hardware accelerators that introduce a new family of issues (scheduling, data transfers, synchronization, ) that the programmer must take into account. In this paper, we propose a simple extension to OmpSs -- a data-flow programming model -- that dramatically simplifies the integration of accelerated code, in the form of CUDA or OpenCL kernels, into any C, C++ or Fortran application. Our proposal fully replaces the CUDA and OpenCL host APIs with a few pragmas, so we can leverage any kernel written in CUDA C or OpenCL C without any performance impact. Our compiler generates all the boilerplat code while our runtime system takes care of kernels scheduling, data transfers between host and accelerators and synchronizations between host and kernels parts. To evaluate our approach, we have ported several native CUDA and OpenCL applications to OmpSs by replacing all the CUDA or OpenCL API calls by a few number of pragmas. The OmpSs versions of these applications have competitive performance and scalability but with a significantly lower complexity than the original ones.","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 26th International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 26th International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6967884/6970630/06970654.pdf","startPage":"112","endPage":"119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leveraging OmpSs to Exploit Hardware Accelerators","doi":"10.1109/SBAC-PAD.2014.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6970630","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBAC-PAD.2014.26","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6970654","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6970654/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Leveraging OmpSs to Exploit Hardware Accelerators","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14792386","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6970654/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leveraging OmpSs to Exploit Hardware Accelerators","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"6905a112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076266S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6967884","isNumber":"6970630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6967884","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6970630","articleId":"6970654","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6970658,"authors":[{"name":"Marcio Machado Pereira","affiliation":["Institute of Computing UNICAMP"],"firstName":"Marcio Machado","lastName":"Pereira","id":"37085547106"},{"name":"Matthew Gaudet","affiliation":["Computing Science Department, University of Alberta"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Gaudet","id":"37085455294"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Nelson Amaral","affiliation":["Computing Science Department, University of Alberta"],"firstName":"Jos\u00e9 Nelson","lastName":"Amaral","id":"37293739400"},{"name":"Guido Ara\u00fajo","affiliation":["Institute of Computing UNICAMP"],"firstName":"Guido","lastName":"Ara\u00fajo","id":"37275641100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6905-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-6533"}],"articleNumber":"6970658","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Benchmark testing","Pollution","Software","Registers","Synchronization","Buffer storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microprocessor chips","storage management","transaction processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Haswell transactional memory performance","hardware transactional memory","HTM","Intel x86 core processors","TM application characteristics","Eigenbench benchmark","CLOMP-TM benchmark","Intel transaction synchronization extension"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an extensive performance study of the implementation of Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM) in the Haswell generation of Intel x86 core processors.

Also, a detailed clock and power gating analysis further proves the viability of our approach.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Clocks","Power demand","Multicore processing","Registers","Application specific integrated circuits","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","coprocessors","integrated circuit design","multiprocessing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ASIC design","shared vector accelerators","multicore processors","vector coprocessor resources","data level parallelism","vector length variations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ASIC design","vector processor","multicore processor","power management"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6970663","doi":"10.1109/SBAC-PAD.2014.13","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 26th International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6967884/6970630/06970663.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBAC-PAD.2014.13","startPage":"182","endPage":"189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6970630","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 26th International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ASIC Design of Shared Vector Accelerators for Multicore Processors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ASIC Design of Shared Vector Accelerators for Multicore Processors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6970663/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6970663/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14792397","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ASIC Design of Shared Vector Accelerators for Multicore Processors","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"6905a182.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084653S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6967884","isNumber":"6970630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6967884","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6970630","articleId":"6970663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6970677,"authors":[{"name":"Guthemberg Silvestre","affiliation":["CNRS, LAAS, Toulouse, France","Univ de Toulouse, LAAS, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Guthemberg","lastName":"Silvestre","id":"37077039100"},{"name":"Carla Sauvanaud","affiliation":["CNRS, LAAS, Toulouse, France","Univ de Toulouse, LAAS, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Carla","lastName":"Sauvanaud","id":"37085520681"},{"name":"Mohamed Ka\u00e2niche","affiliation":["CNRS, LAAS, Toulouse, France","Univ de Toulouse, LAAS, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Ka\u00e2niche","id":"37352452500"},{"name":"Karama Kanoun","affiliation":["CNRS, LAAS, Toulouse, France","Univ de Toulouse, LAAS, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Karama","lastName":"Kanoun","id":"37273078700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6905-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-6533"}],"articleNumber":"6970677","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":202},"abstract":"Scale-out storage systems (SoSS) have become increasingly important for meeting availability requirements of web services in cloud platforms. To enhance data availability, SoSS rely on a variety of built-in fault-tolerant mechanisms, including replication, redundant network topologies, advanced request scheduling, and other failover techniques. However, performance issues in cloud services still remain one of the main causes of discontentment among their tenants. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection approach for SoSS that predicts cloud anomalies caused by memory and network faults. To evaluate our prediction model, we built a testbed simulating a virtual data center using VMware. Experimental results confirm that the injected faults are likely to undermine the data availability in SoSS. They suggest that although unsupervised learning has been the most common method for anomaly detection, a supervisedbased implementation of the same model reduces the false positive rate by roughly 10%. Our analysis also points out that probing SoSS-specific monitoring data at the VM-level contributes to improve the anomaly prediction efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 26th International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6967884/6970630/06970677.pdf","startPage":"294","endPage":"301","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 26th International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing","doi":"10.1109/SBAC-PAD.2014.42","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBAC-PAD.2014.42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6970630","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6970677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Anomaly Detection Approach for Scale-Out Storage Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Predictive models","Unsupervised learning","Training","Throughput","Availability","Loss measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","fault tolerant computing","security of data","storage management","unsupervised learning","virtualisation","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection approach","scale-out storage systems","SoSS","availability requirements","Web services","cloud platforms","data availability","built-in fault-tolerant mechanisms","replication","redundant network topologies","request scheduling","failover techniques","cloud services","memory faults","network faults","prediction model","virtual data center","VMware","faults injection","unsupervised learning","anomaly prediction efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6970677/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"An Anomaly Detection Approach for Scale-Out Storage Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6970677/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14792380","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Anomaly Detection Approach for Scale-Out Storage Systems","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"6905a294.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082635S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6967884","isNumber":"6970630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6967884","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6970630","articleId":"6970677","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6970705,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto Riggio","affiliation":["CREATE-NET, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Riggio","id":"37391696200"},{"name":"Cigdem Sengul","affiliation":["Oxford Brookes University, London, UK"],"firstName":"Cigdem","lastName":"Sengul","id":"37424709100"},{"name":"Lalith Suresh","affiliation":["Telekom Innovation Laboratories, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Lalith","lastName":"Suresh","id":"37861737800"},{"name":"Julius Schulz\u2013zander","affiliation":["Telekom Innovation Laboratories, Germany"],"firstName":"Julius","lastName":"Schulz\u2013zander","id":"37087422735"},{"name":"Anja Feldmann","affiliation":["Telekom Innovation Laboratories, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Anja","lastName":"Feldmann","id":"37295454600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0056-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0055-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0054-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6970705","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":272},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6970705","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","IEEE 802.11 Standards","Handover","Signal to noise ratio","Wireless communication","Energy management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","energy consumption","mobility management (mobile radio)","software defined networking","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Thor","energy programmable WiFi networks","WiFi hotspots","cellular networks","mobile applications","energy waste","energy management","mobility management","Energino","open real-time energy consumption monitoring toolkit","Odin","software defined networking","WLAN","clients cluster","access points","energy efficiency"]}],"abstract":"WiFi hotspots are increasingly deployed to relieve cellular networks from the burden generated by data-hungry mobile applications.

In particular, cooperative cognitive radio network model considers cooperative relaying of secondary users in cognitive radio networks, which utilize the spectrum occupancy efficiently. However, such cooperation may not occur when secondary users have a better alternative, spectrum leasing. Therefore, in this paper, we study the impact of leasing in a network model with game-theoretic analysis. We first show the importance of the problem with a simple two-secondary-user game. Finally we extend our formulation and analysis to explicitly incorporate the effects of lease strength for a n-secondary-user game given the occupancy model of primary users.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2013.6970752","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6562841","startPage":"87","endPage":"88","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6556114/6562841/06970752.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secondary user games with spectrum leasing market in cooperative cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6970752/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6970752/","displayDocTitle":"Secondary user games with spectrum leasing market in cooperative cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"14-19 April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"14818286","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secondary user games with spectrum leasing market in cooperative cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"p87-roh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058286S","chronDate":"14-19 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6556114","isNumber":"6562841","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6556114","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6562841","articleId":"6970752","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6970763,"authors":[{"name":"Jiajia Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/7331734/6970763/liu-2375934-small.gif","p":["\nJiajia Liu (S'11\u2013M'12) received the Ph.D. degree in information sciences from Tohoku University, Japan, in 2012.

In this paper, to further improve the performance of TRPC AcR, we propose a TRPC averaging (TRPC-A) AcR by using a TRPC-A method, which is similar but different from the pulse averaging method used in a conventional TR scheme. The proposed receiver structure is designed in both analog and digital methods, and their implementation complexities are explored. Our analytical and simulation results show that the proposed receiver can greatly improve the performance over the original TRPC receiver. What is more, the required additional implementation complexity of the proposed TRPC-A receiver added to the original TRPC AcR is much less than that of the averaging TR AcR added to conventional TR AcR due to the TRPC signaling characteristics. Therefore, from a practical point of view, the designed TRPC-A AcR is considered as a highly recommended practice, particularly in multiuser access environments.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/7959216/06970770.pdf","startPage":"1107","endPage":"1115","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2014.2367120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2014.2367120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7959216","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6970770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Transmitted Reference Pulse Cluster Averaging UWB Receiver","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Complexity theory","Synchronization","Band-pass filters","Noise","Delays","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","multiuser channels","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UWB receiver","transmitted reference pulse cluster structure","TRPC structure","ultrawideband communications","robust autocorrelation receiver","TRPC averaging AcR","pulse averaging method","analog methods","digital methods","TRPC-A receiver","TRPC signaling characteristics","multiuser access environments"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Noncoherent receiver","transmitted reference pulse cluster (TRPC)","ultrawideband (UWB)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6970770/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Transmitted Reference Pulse Cluster Averaging UWB Receiver","volume":"11","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6970770/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16992954","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingName":"Korea government","grantNumber":"2010-0018116"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Transmitted Reference Pulse Cluster Averaging UWB Receiver","sourcePdf":"jsyst-jin-2367120-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069352S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"7959216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7959216","articleId":"6970770","onlineDate":"02 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6970780,"authors":[{"name":"Ram Zamir","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems, Tel Aviv University, Israel"],"firstName":"Ram","lastName":"Zamir","id":"37284119000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5999-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1662-9019"}],"articleNumber":"6970780","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6970780","abstract":"Lattice codes find applications in various digital communications settings, including shaping for power-constrained channels, coding with side information (dirty-paper channel, Wyner-Ziv source), and Gaussian networks.

A particular gain from this homogeneous setup is that the symmetric DoF allocation providing complete fairness among all users is sum-DoF optimal.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963754/6970773/06970799.pdf","startPage":"92","endPage":"96","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2014.6970799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2014.6970799","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6970773","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6970799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symmetric Degrees of Freedom of the MIMO 3-way channel with M<inf>T</inf> \u00d7 M<inf>R</inf> antennas","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Receiving antennas","Upper bound","Interference","Transmitting antennas","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","MIMO communication","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication channels","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symmetric degrees of freedom","MIMO 3-way channel","MT \u00d7 MR antennas","homogeneous multiple-input multiple-output","two-way channel","full-duplex mode","genie-aided upper bounds","MIMO interference alignment","null-space beam-forming","zero-forcing","symmetric DoF allocation","sum-DoF optimal"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6970799/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Symmetric Degrees of Freedom of the MIMO 3-way channel with M<inf>T</inf> \u00d7 M<inf>R</inf> antennas","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6970799/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14791136","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symmetric Degrees of Freedom of the MIMO 3-way channel with M<inf>T</inf> \u00d7 M<inf>R</inf> antennas","confLoc":"Hobart, TAS, Australia","sourcePdf":"1092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063388S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963754","isNumber":"6970773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963754","xplore-issue":"6970773","articleId":"6970799","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6970800,"authors":[{"name":"Lu Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Yang","id":"38239524500"},{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37278432600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5999-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1662-9019"}],"articleNumber":"6970800","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","MIMO","Interference channels","Receiving antennas","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3-user MIMO interference channel","degree of freedom","linear spatial beamforming scheme","sum DoF outer bound","signal transmission strategy","interference alignment method"]}],"abstract":"This paper studies the achievable degrees of freedom (DoF) of 3-user MIMO interference channels based on linear spatial beamforming scheme.

In this paper, using quadratic residue codes and their supercodes, we give a simple construction for quantum synchronizable codes whose synchronization capabilities attain the upper bound. The method is applicable to cyclic codes of prime length.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantum synchronizable codes from quadratic residue codes and their supercodes","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2014.6970815","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963754/6970773/06970815.pdf","startPage":"172","endPage":"176","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2014.6970815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6970773","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6970815","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6970815/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Quantum synchronizable codes from quadratic residue codes and their supercodes","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6970815/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14791073","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum synchronizable codes from quadratic residue codes and their supercodes","confLoc":"Hobart, TAS, Australia","sourcePdf":"1172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063124S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963754","isNumber":"6970773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963754","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6970773","articleId":"6970815","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6970818,"authors":[{"name":"Eirik Rosnes","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway"],"firstName":"Eirik","lastName":"Rosnes","id":"37272234600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5999-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1662-9019"}],"articleNumber":"6970818","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiation detectors","Iterative decoding","Sockets","Entropy","Couplings","Maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","flow measurement","iterative decoding","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["\u21131-norm minimization reconstruction","Gaussian measurement matrices","sparse region","undersampling-sparsity phase transition trajectory","nonnegative signals","compressed sensing schemes","iterative decoding","flow size distribution","entropy lower bound","optimal decoding","asymptotic compression rate","per-flow measurements","counter architecture","SC-CB","spatially-coupled counter braids"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6970818","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2014.6970818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2014.6970818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6970773","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963754/6970773/06970818.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatially-coupled counter braids","abstract":"A counter braid (CB) is a novel counter architecture for per-flow measurements on high-speed links.

In this paper, we explore this connection within an information theoretic framework. We show that, under certain symmetry conditions, the principal inertia components play an important role in estimating one-bit functions of X, namely f(X), given an observation of Y. In particular, the principal inertia components bear an interpretation as filter coefficients in the linear transformation of p\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">f(X)|X</sub>\n into p\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">f(X)|Y</sub>\n.

For a known velocity, we characterize the optimal tradeoff between time and resolution (i.e., maximal rate), and show that in contrast to the case of constant measurement noise, measurement dependent noise incurs a multiplicative gap between adaptive search and non-adaptive search.

The lattice coded layers are then precoded using unitary matrices satisfying non-vanishing minimum product distance. At the receiver side, an integer-forcing linear receiver is employed. This scheme is called `unitary precoded integer-forcing'. We show that by applying the proposed precoding technique full-diversity can be achieved. We then verify this result by conducting computer simulations in a 2 \u00d7 2 and 4 \u00d7 4 multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel using full-diversity algebraic rotation precoder matrices.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963754/6970773/06970836.pdf","startPage":"277","endPage":"281","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2014.6970836","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2014.6970836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6970773","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6970836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unitary precoding for integer-forcing MIMO linear receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lattices","Receivers","MIMO","Decoding","Transmitters","Matrix decomposition","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebraic codes","antenna arrays","fading channels","MIMO communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unitary precoding","multiple-input multiple-output channel","integer-forcing MIMO linear receivers","flat fading point-to-point multiple-antenna channel","channel state information","information symbols","lattice codewords","lattice coded layers","unitary matrices","full-diversity algebraic rotation precoder matrices"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Integer-Forcing","unitary precoding","lattice codes","full-diversity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6970836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Unitary precoding for integer-forcing MIMO linear receivers","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6970836/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14791141","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unitary precoding for integer-forcing MIMO linear receivers","confLoc":"Hobart, TAS, Australia","sourcePdf":"1277.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.135949S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963754","isNumber":"6970773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963754","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6970773","articleId":"6970836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6970837,"authors":[{"name":"Elad Domanovitz","affiliation":["Dept. of EE-Systems, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Elad","lastName":"Domanovitz","id":"38526314500"},{"name":"Uri Erez","affiliation":["Dept. of EE-Systems, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Uri","lastName":"Erez","id":"37284119700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5999-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1662-9019"}],"articleNumber":"6970837","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrices","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Silicon carbide","Receiving antennas","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","Gaussian channels","MIMO communication","multicast communication","precoding","space-time codes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["precoded integer-forcing performance","closed-loop MIMO multicast","equalization scheme","low-complexity scheme","open-loop multiple-input multiple-output Gaussian channel","space-time linear precoding","channel state information","transmission rate maximization","multicast capacity","transmit antennas","receiver architecture","linear code"]}],"abstract":"The integer-forcing receiver architecture has recently been proposed as a high-performance, yet low-complexity, equalization scheme, that is applicable when all data streams are encoded with the same linear code. It was further shown in [1], that this receiver architecture, when coupled with space-time linear precoding is able to achieve the capacity of the open-loop multiple-input multiple-output channel, up to a constant gap that depends only on the number of transmit antennas. The gap, however, is quite large and thus provides performance guarantees that are useful only for high values of capacity. In this work, we consider the problem of multicast over multiple-input multiple-output channels to a modest number of users, and with space-only linear precoding. It is assumed that channel state information is available to the transmitter, allowing it to optimize the precoding matrix so as to maximize the achievable transmission rate. It is numerically demonstrated that this architecture allows to very closely approach the multicast capacity at all transmission rates regimes.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2014.6970837","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963754/6970773/06970837.pdf","startPage":"282","endPage":"286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2014.6970837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6970773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of precoded integer-forcing for closed-loop MIMO multicast","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6970837","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6970837/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of precoded integer-forcing for closed-loop MIMO multicast","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14791072","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6970837/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of precoded integer-forcing for closed-loop MIMO multicast","confLoc":"Hobart, TAS, Australia","sourcePdf":"1282.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057494S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963754","isNumber":"6970773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963754","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6970773","articleId":"6970837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6970839,"authors":[{"name":"Aris L.

In this work, we introduce a methodology that allows to compute the long time statistics of such metrics in a network. After describing the general approach, we consider a specific example of the uplink channel of a mobile user in the vicinity of a base station equipped with a large number of antennas (the so called \u201cmassive MIMO\u201d base station). To guarantee a fixed signal-to-noise ratio and rate, the user inverts the pathloss channel power, while moving around in the cell. To calculate the long time distribution of the corresponding consumed energy, we assume that its movement follows a Brownian motion, and then map the problem to the solution of the minimum eigenvalue of a partial differential equation, which can be solved either analytically, or numerically very fast. The single-user throughput is also treated. We then present some results and discuss how they can be generalized if the mobility model is assumed to be a Levy random walk. A roadmap to use this methodology is eventually given to extend results to a multiple user set-up with multiple base stations.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2014.6970839","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963754/6970773/06970839.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2014.6970839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6970773","startPage":"292","endPage":"296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of mobility on user energy consumption and total throughput in a massive MIMO system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6970839","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effects of mobility on user energy consumption and total throughput in a massive MIMO system","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6970839/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14805808","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6970839/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of mobility on user energy consumption and total throughput in a massive MIMO system","confLoc":"Hobart, TAS, Australia","sourcePdf":"1292.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06664S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963754","isNumber":"6970773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963754","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6970773","articleId":"6970839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6970840,"authors":[{"name":"Min Li","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Li","id":"37085486447"},{"name":"Iain B.

In particular, we focus on a two-cell cluster, where both base stations have only local data and local channel state information, but each has sufficient number of antennas to serve multiple homogeneous users under a full zero-forcing beamforming transmission. The scheduling problem is formulated as finding proper scheduled users and hence beamformers across the cells such that the sum rate is maximized. We uncover the structure for a good scheduling decision, which in turn motivates three distributed coordinated scheduling policies of different levels of complexity. For the simplest policy, we derive a lower bound on the expected achievable sum rate. It is shown in the large user population limit, the simplest policy suffices to preserve the best possible multiplexing gain and multiuser diversity gain for the model studied, but it does induce a pairing loss on the sum rate due to the limited coordination between cells.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2014.6970840","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963754/6970773/06970840.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6970773","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2014.6970840","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)","startPage":"297","endPage":"301","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multicell coordinated scheduling with multiuser ZF beamforming: Policies and performance bounds","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6970840","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Multicell coordinated scheduling with multiuser ZF beamforming: Policies and performance bounds","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6970840/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6970840/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14791110","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicell coordinated scheduling with multiuser ZF beamforming: Policies and performance bounds","confLoc":"Hobart, TAS, Australia","sourcePdf":"1297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053026S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963754","isNumber":"6970773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963754","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6970773","articleId":"6970840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6970842,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Claude Belfiore","affiliation":["Dept Communications and Electronics, Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Claude","lastName":"Belfiore","id":"37284731700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5999-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1662-9019"}],"articleNumber":"6970842","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"abstract":"In this presentation we are interested in coding for wiretap wireless channels.

Specifically, we study state amplification and state masking, which define the maximum and minimum amount of state information conveyed to the receiver for a given message rate, respectively. For an independent and identically distributed energy harvesting process, we first find the amplification and masking regions for a transmitter without a battery and a transmitter with an infinite battery. Next, we find inner bounds for these regions for a unit-sized battery at the transmitter using two different encoding schemes, using instantaneous Shannon strategies and using a scheme based on the equivalent timing channel introduced in our previous work. We observe that the former provides better state amplification, while the latter provides better state masking.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6970773","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2014.6970849","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963754/6970773/06970849.pdf","startPage":"336","endPage":"340","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2014.6970849","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"State amplification and state masking for the binary energy harvesting channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"State amplification and state masking for the binary energy harvesting channel","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6970849/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14791095","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6970849/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"State amplification and state masking for the binary energy harvesting channel","confLoc":"Hobart, TAS, Australia","sourcePdf":"1336.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046646S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963754","isNumber":"6970773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963754","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6970773","articleId":"6970849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6970850,"authors":[{"name":"Suzhi Bi","affiliation":["ECE Department, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Suzhi","lastName":"Bi","id":"37997376700"},{"name":"Chin Keong Ho","affiliation":["Agency for Science Technology and Research, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Chin Keong","lastName":"Ho"},{"name":"Rui Zhang","affiliation":["A-STAR, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore","ECE Department, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37274563900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5999-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1662-9019"}],"articleNumber":"6970850","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":739},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Receivers","Array signal processing","Energy exchange","Wireless sensor networks","Transmitters","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy harvesting","microwave power transmission","radio networks","signal processing","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave-enabled wireless energy transfer","state-of-the-art WET technology","signal processing technique","energy transfer efficiency maximization","simultaneous wireless information and power transfer","SWIPT","radio waveform","wireless powered communication network","wireless devices communicate","power harvesting"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we provide an overview of the recent advances in microwave-enabled wireless energy transfer (WET) technologies and their applications in wireless communications.

Then, we discuss an interesting paradigm named simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), where energy and information are jointly transmitted using the same radio waveform.

In this paper, we first formally define the multiple folding operation (iterated \u03ba times), which decomposes the original encoding graph into a number of smaller polar encoding graphs. More specifically, we show that the multiple folding gives rise to a two stage interpretation of the graph representing the polar encoder and the SCD. Based on this, we propose the improved multiple folded successive cancellation decoder (IMFSCD), which combines SCD in one stage and maximum-likelihood decoding in the other.

Through comparison, we show that the analytical delay-exponent has a close match with the delay-exponent obtained from numerical results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Decoding","Delays","Parity check codes","Encoding","Noise measurement","Convolutional codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parity check codes","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mathematical induction technique","density evolution analysis","LDPC code","spatially coupled low density parity check code","three terminal relay network","bilayer anytime code delay-exponent analytical expression"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6970872","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2014.6970872","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963754/6970773/06970872.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2014.6970872","startPage":"451","endPage":"455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6970773","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay-exponent of bilayer anytime code","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Delay-exponent of bilayer anytime code","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6970872/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6970872/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14805825","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay-exponent of bilayer anytime code","confLoc":"Hobart, TAS, Australia","sourcePdf":"1451.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098824S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963754","isNumber":"6970773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963754","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6970773","articleId":"6970872","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6970873,"authors":[{"name":"Sachini Jayasooriya","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Newcastle, Australia"],"firstName":"Sachini","lastName":"Jayasooriya","id":"37085413129"},{"name":"Sarah J.

The standard iterative decoding algorithm, known as belief propagation, passes messages along the edges of this Tanner graph. Density evolution is an efficient method to analyze the performance of the belief propagation decoding algorithm for a particular LDPC code ensemble, enabling the determination of a decoding threshold. The basic problem addressed in this work is how to optimize the Tanner graph so that the decoding threshold is as large as possible. We introduce a new code optimization technique which involves the search space range which can be thought of as minimizing randomness in differential evolution or limiting the search range in exhaustive search. This technique is applied to the design of good irregular LDPC codes and multi-edge type LDPC codes.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2014.6970873","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963754/6970773/06970873.pdf","startPage":"456","endPage":"460","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2014.6970873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6970773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of graph based codes for belief propagation decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6970873","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6970873/","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of graph based codes for belief propagation decoding","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14805813","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6970873/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of graph based codes for belief propagation decoding","confLoc":"Hobart, TAS, Australia","sourcePdf":"1456.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060008S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963754","isNumber":"6970773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963754","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6970773","articleId":"6970873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6970874,"authors":[{"name":"Behzad Amiri","affiliation":["Electrical Eng.

In practical scenarios, only a small sub-set of the users can be scheduled simultaneously. However, since solutions which collect Channel State Information (CSI) from all users and schedule the best subset to transmit do not scale with K, distributed scheduling algorithms are advantageous. We analyze a distributed scheduling algorithm, which selects a group of users to transmit without coordinating between the users and without all users sending CSI to the base station. The expected capacity under Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) decoding is given, with a special emphasis on large K. It is shown that the algorithm achieves the same scaling laws as the optimal centralized scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2014.6970880","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)","startPage":"491","endPage":"495","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2014.6970880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6970773","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963754/6970773/06970880.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-input single-output multiple-access channel","MISO multiple-access channel","channel state information","CSI","distributed scheduling algorithms","base station","minimum mean squared error decoding","MMSE decoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The capacity of the Multiple Access Channel under distributed scheduling and MMSE decoding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6970880/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6970880/","accessionNumber":"14805815","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The capacity of the Multiple Access Channel under distributed scheduling and MMSE decoding","confLoc":"Hobart, TAS, Australia","sourcePdf":"1491.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092398S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963754","isNumber":"6970773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963754","xplore-issue":"6970773","articleId":"6970880","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6970882,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Makhdoumi","affiliation":["MIT"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Makhdoumi","id":"37085346256"},{"name":"Salman Salamatian","affiliation":["EPFL"],"firstName":"Salman","lastName":"Salamatian","id":"37085539557"},{"name":"Nadia Fawaz","affiliation":["Technicolor"],"firstName":"Nadia","lastName":"Fawaz","id":"37393631600"},{"name":"Muriel M\u00e9dard","affiliation":["MIT"],"firstName":"Muriel","lastName":"M\u00e9dard","id":"37268947300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5999-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1662-9019"}],"articleNumber":"6970882","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":71,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":693},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From the Information Bottleneck to the Privacy Funnel","abstract":"We focus on the privacy-utility trade-off encountered by users who wish to disclose some information to an analyst, that is correlated with their private data, in the hope of receiving some utility. We rely on a general privacy statistical inference framework, under which data is transformed before it is disclosed, according to a probabilistic privacy mapping. We show that when the log-loss is introduced in this framework in both the privacy metric and the distortion metric, the privacy leakage and the utility constraint can be reduced to the mutual information between private data and disclosed data, and between non-private data and disclosed data respectively. We justify the relevance and generality of the privacy metric under the log-loss by proving that the inference threat under any bounded cost function can be upperbounded by an explicit function of the mutual information between private data and disclosed data. We then show that the privacy-utility tradeoff under the log-loss can be cast as the non-convex Privacy Funnel optimization, and we leverage its connection to the Information Bottleneck, to provide a greedy algorithm that is locally optimal. We evaluate its performance on the US census dataset. Finally, we characterize the optimal privacy mapping for the Gaussian Privacy Funnel.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2014.6970882","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2014.6970882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6970773","startPage":"501","endPage":"505","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963754/6970773/06970882.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6970882","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Privacy","Data privacy","Optimization","Mutual information","Greedy algorithms","Distortion measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data privacy","greedy algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information bottleneck","privacy-utility trade-off","probabilistic privacy mapping","log-loss","privacy leakage","utility constraint","disclosed data","nonprivate data","privacy metric","bounded cost function","privacy-utility tradeoff","nonconvex privacy funnel optimization","greedy algorithm","US census dataset","optimal privacy mapping","Gaussian privacy funnel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"From the Information Bottleneck to the Privacy Funnel","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14791153","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6970882/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6970882/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From the Information Bottleneck to the Privacy Funnel","confLoc":"Hobart, TAS, Australia","sourcePdf":"1501.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063031S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963754","isNumber":"6970773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963754","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"6970773","articleId":"6970882","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":6970900,"authors":[{"name":"Zilong Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Zilong","lastName":"Liu","id":"38237686700"},{"name":"Yong Liang Guan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yong Liang","lastName":"Guan","id":"37272208800"},{"name":"Udaya Parampalli","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Information Systems, University of Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Udaya","lastName":"Parampalli","id":"37540693800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5999-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1662-9019"}],"articleNumber":"6970900","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":296},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Multiaccess communication","Vectors","Educational institutions","Boolean functions","Electronic mail","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Reed-Muller codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zero correlation zone sequences","ZCZ sequence sets","first order generalized Reed-Muller codes"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a direct construction of zero-correlation zone (ZCZ) sequence sets (each associated with a graph) from the second order cosets of the first-order generalized Reed-Muller codes.

In a recent work, we have proposed a layered coding scheme where a scalar wiretap code is used in each layer, and successive interference cancellation (SIC) is carried at the legitimate receiver. By a proper rate allocation across the layers, we showed that this scheme satisfies the secrecy constraint at the eavesdropper and achieves the secrecy capacity. However, the existence of the scalar codes was based upon a random coding argument. In this work we take a further step and show how the scheme can be based upon any codes that are good for the ordinary (non-secrecy) additive white Gaussian noise channel. As any stage of the SIC process is equivalent to achieving a corner point of a Gaussian multiple-access channel (MAC) capacity region, the class of codes used needs to be good for the MAC under SIC. Since in the secrecy analysis of our layered scheme, it suffices at each stage to consider a genie-aided eavesdropper that performs SIC, the coding task reduces to guaranteeing secrecy for corner points of induced MACs to the eavesdropper. Structured generation of such codes from ordinary ones is discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2014.6970908","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963754/6970773/06970908.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2014.6970908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6970773","startPage":"631","endPage":"635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From ordinary AWGN codes to optimal MIMO wiretap schemes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6970908","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"From ordinary AWGN codes to optimal MIMO wiretap schemes","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6970908/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14791059","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6970908/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From ordinary AWGN codes to optimal MIMO wiretap schemes","confLoc":"Hobart, TAS, Australia","sourcePdf":"1631.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066159S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963754","isNumber":"6970773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963754","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6970773","articleId":"6970908","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6970915,"authors":[{"name":"He Chen","affiliation":["The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085345795"},{"name":"Xiangyun Zhou","affiliation":["The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia"],"firstName":"Xiangyun","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37406420900"},{"name":"Yonghui Li","affiliation":["The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Yonghui","lastName":"Li","id":"37279887100"},{"name":"Peng Wang","affiliation":["The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292831100"},{"name":"Branka Vucetic","affiliation":["The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Branka","lastName":"Vucetic","id":"37278594000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5999-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1662-9019"}],"articleNumber":"6970915","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":536},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Relays","Throughput","Energy exchange","Resource management","Information processing","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","energy harvesting","microwave power transmission","protocols","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication power management","telecommunication power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless powered cooperative communications","hybrid relay","hybrid access point","information source","energy supply embedding","constant power supply","cooperative protocols","power allocation","downlink energy transfer","uplink information transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless energy transfer","RF energy harvesting","cooperative communications"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider a wireless-powered cooperative communication network, which consists of a hybrid access-point (AP), a hybrid relay, and an information source. In contrast to the conventional cooperative networks, the source in the considered network is assumed to have no embedded energy supply. Thus, it first needs to harvest energy from the signals broadcast by the AP and/or relay, which have constant power supply, in the downlink (DL) before transmitting the information to the AP in the uplink (UL). The hybrid relay can not only help to forward information in the UL but also charge the source with wireless energy transfer in the DL. Considering different possible operations of the hybrid relay, we propose two cooperative protocols for the considered network. We jointly optimize the time and power allocation for DL energy transfer and UL information transmission to maximize the system throughput of the proposed protocols. Numerical results are presented to compare the performance of the proposed protocols and illustrate the impacts of system parameters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless-powered cooperative communications via a hybrid relay","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2014.6970915","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963754/6970773/06970915.pdf","startPage":"666","endPage":"670","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2014.6970915","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6970773","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6970915","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6970915/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Wireless-powered cooperative communications via a hybrid relay","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6970915/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14791057","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless-powered cooperative communications via a hybrid relay","confLoc":"Hobart, TAS, Australia","sourcePdf":"1666.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052699S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963754","isNumber":"6970773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963754","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6970773","articleId":"6970915","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6970966,"authors":[{"name":"Sachin U.

The OEO is configured in a delayed feedback loop employing a long optical fiber delay line and other elements including a tunable laser, a phase modulator (PM) and a linearly chirped fiber Bragg grating (LCFBG), a photodetector, and an electrical amplifier. The joint operation of the PM and the LCFBG forms an ultrawideband microwave photonic filter (MFP). Taking advantage of the multiple time scales arising from the MPF and the long optical fiber delay line, we are able to generate subnanosecond neuron-like spiking and bursting signals that emulate the response found to be the primary mode of electrical firing in biological neurons. Since our OEO can operate at a much higher speed and can be controlled using both time-delayed feedback employing low-loss optical fiber and electrical/optical injection locking techniques, it has interest in emerging photonics applications such as neuromorphic information processing and reservoir computing tasks.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2014.2376775","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7018114/06971054.pdf","startPage":"503","endPage":"510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7018114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2014.2376775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6971054","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Speed Spiking and Bursting Oscillations in a Long-Delayed Broadband Optoelectronic Oscillator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971054/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15, 15 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"High-Speed Spiking and Bursting Oscillations in a Long-Delayed Broadband Optoelectronic Oscillator","volume":"33","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"14881002","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2015","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"15 Jan.15, 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6971054/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"},{"fundingName":"FCT Portugal for a Postdoctoral Fellowship","grantNumber":"SFRH/BPD/84466/2012"},{"fundingName":"Ram\u00f3n y Cajal"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Speed Spiking and Bursting Oscillations in a Long-Delayed Broadband Optoelectronic Oscillator","sourcePdf":"jlt-yao-2376775-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115289S","chronDate":"Jan.15, 15 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7018114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7018114","articleId":"6971054","onlineDate":"02 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6971056,"authors":[{"name":"Hurmat Ali Shah","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Computer Engineering, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7024232/6971056/shah-2375363-small.gif","p":["Hurmat Ali Shah received the M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees in computer systems engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology at Peshawar, Peshawar, Pakistan, in 2013 and 2010, respectively.

Cooperative spectrum sensing is susceptible to security risks, where malicious users who participate in the process falsify the spectrum sensing data, thus affecting cognitive radio network performance. In this paper, an efficient spectrum sensing system is developed where each cognitive radio (CR) user senses the spectrum multiple times within an allocated sensing period. Each CR user quantizes its decision to predefined levels so as to achieve a tradeoff between bandwidth utilization and decision reporting accuracy. The reports for all the CR users are compared at the fusion center using Smith-Waterman algorithm, an optimal algorithm for aligning biological sequences used in bioinformatics, and similarity indices are computed. Robust mean and robust deviation of the similarity indices are calculated and a threshold is determined by these values. The CR users who have similarity indices below the given threshold are declared malicious and their reports are discarded. The local decisions of the remaining CR users are combined using the modified rules of decision combination to take a global decision. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme performs better than conventional schemes with and without malicious users.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2014.2375363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7024232","startPage":"2324","endPage":"2334","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7024232/06971056.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bioinformatics-Inspired Quantized Hard Combination-Based Abnormality Detection for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971056/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6971056/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Bioinformatics-Inspired Quantized Hard Combination-Based Abnormality Detection for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"14907287","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"4","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"NRF-2013R1A2A2A05004535 and NRF-2012R1A1A2038831"},{"fundingName":"Korea Government through the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bioinformatics-Inspired Quantized Hard Combination-Based Abnormality Detection for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"jsen-koo-2375363-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074069S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7024232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7024232","articleId":"6971056","onlineDate":"02 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6971058,"authors":[{"name":"Longhua Guo","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Integrated Administration Technologies for Information Security, School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7057632/6971058/guo-2373388-small.gif","p":["Longhua Guo was born in Shanxi, China, in 1991.

Ensuring security of communications over XMPP is one of the most important issues in ISO/IEC/IEEE21451-1-4 sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a security mechanism that deals with the requirements of authentication, integrity, confidentiality, nonrepudiation, and access control. The XMPP-based communications in ISO/IEC/IEEE 21451 sensor networks utilize the username/password security token as well as integrated publish/subscribe (pub/sub) and role-based access control technologies. Based on the proposed mechanism, ISO/IEC/IEEE 21451 messages are exchanged based on the pub/sub model using an extended security simple object access protocol over XMPP until released. An instance is the model based on ISO/IEC/IEEE 21451-1-4 to secure the XMPP-based communication in sensor network. The result supports the feasibility of the security mechanism for XMPP-based ISO/IEC/IEEE 21451 sensor networks.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2014.2373388","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7057632/06971058.pdf","startPage":"2577","endPage":"2586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2014.2373388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7057632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proposed Security Mechanism for XMPP-Based Communications of ISO/IEC/IEEE 21451 Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971058/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","displayDocTitle":"Proposed Security Mechanism for XMPP-Based Communications of ISO/IEC/IEEE 21451 Sensor Networks","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6971058/","accessionNumber":"14982716","volume":"15","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Doctoral Scientific Fund Project through the Ministry of Education, China","grantNumber":"20130073130006"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401273 and 61431008"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proposed Security Mechanism for XMPP-Based Communications of ISO/IEC/IEEE 21451 Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"jsen-wu-2373388-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082464S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7057632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7057632","articleId":"6971058","onlineDate":"02 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6971061,"authors":[{"name":"Tor A.

The main barriers are implementability and dependability, where important factors are implementation of advanced numerical optimization algorithms on resource-limited embedded computing platforms and the associated complexity of verification. This challenge comes from a requirement of the use of ultrareliable hardware and software architectures in safety-critical applications, low-cost hardware in consumer products, or both. This paper surveys the state-of-the-art in the emerging field of dependable embedded MPC, and discusses some key challenges related to its design, implementation, and verification. A novel result is the study of a simulator-based performance monitoring and control selection method that monitors and predicts MPC performance and switches to a highly reliable backup controller in cases when the MPC experiences performance issues.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971061/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","volume":"11","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16992942","htmlLink":"/document/6971061/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Toward Dependable Embedded Model Predictive Control","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005416","fundingName":"Research Council of Norway, Statoil and DNV"},{"fundingName":"Research Council of Norway and Statoil"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward Dependable Embedded Model Predictive Control","sourcePdf":"jsyst-johansen-2368129-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102974S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"7959216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"7959216","articleId":"6971061","onlineDate":"02 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6971062,"authors":[{"name":"Maria Aslam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/7416301/6971062/aslam-2367529-small.gif","p":["\nMaria Aslam received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering \nfrom the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan, in 2009 and 2012, respectively.","She has worked as a Research Assistant at the Al-Khwarizmi Institute of Computer Science, Lahore, Pakistan, from \n2009 to 2012.

CRs work in an unlicensed network setting, so it is important that cognitive users utilize the spectrum opportunistically, i.e., without interrupting the licensed user's activity. To provide the opportunistic access for a cognitive 4G user, we propose an architecture that delivers the desired solution by following a novel five-step process. First, the cognitive (or secondary) user relays its throughput requirements from the application layer down to the media access layer by way of cross-layering. Second, the media access layer at its end senses the licensed spectrum and, based on the sensed parameters, characterizes the licensed (or primary) user's amount of spectrum occupancy into three different occupancy level types. Third, the licensed user's spectrum occupancy, categorized into three levels, is statistically represented by setting up a Markov model that evaluates the probability that the licensed channel could be found in a particular state at a given time instant for each level. Fourth, to provide opportunistic spectrum access to the secondary user, an optimization strategy is devised in the media access control layer that will bring face to face the throughput requirements obtained from the application layer and the steady-state probabilities for the licensed channel from the physical layer. Fifth, optimal performance metrics concerning the 4G user throughput and power are attained by solving the optimization problem. Results obtained are simulated against a variety of network parameters, and performance improvement through the proposed scheme is assessed by simulations conducted for a long-term evolution (LTE) system.","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2014.2367529","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/7416301/06971062.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7416301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2014.2367529","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","startPage":"325","endPage":"334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Delivery of 4G Services With Cross-Layered and Power-Optimized Cognitive Radio Architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6971062","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Delivery of 4G Services With Cross-Layered and Power-Optimized Cognitive Radio Architecture","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971062/","volume":"10","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6971062/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15802932","dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Delivery of 4G Services With Cross-Layered and Power-Optimized Cognitive Radio Architecture","sourcePdf":"jsyst-aslam-2367529-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104264S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"7416301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7416301","articleId":"6971062","onlineDate":"02 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6971063,"authors":[{"name":"David Silvera-Tawil","affiliation":["Creative Robotics Laboratory, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"p":["David Silvera-Tawil was born in Mexico City, Mexico.

SNs implement assimilation of new measurement and cooperation with other nodes. Moreover, SNs have different sensing modalities, which can only measure a part of target parameter vector for situation monitoring. While for RNs, the main role is to aggregate their neighboring data. We propose a distributed consensus based unbiased estimation algorithm for this kind of relay assisted sensor networks. By using algebraic graph theory in conjunction with Markov chain approach, we demonstrate how the distributed estimation method can be transformed to circumvent the challenges arisen from the heterogeneity of different kinds of nodes. We analyze the performance of asymptotic unbiasedness and consistency of the proposed algorithm in the presence of asymmetric communication, i.e., when a node can receive information from another node but not vice versa. Furthermore, a quantitative bound on the rate of convergence of the proposed algorithm in the almost sure sense is explicitly established. Finally, simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2014.2375851","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/7038745/06971070.pdf","startPage":"278","endPage":"291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2014.2375851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7038745","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Consensus Based Estimation Over Relay Assisted Sensor Networks for Situation Monitoring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6971070","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971070/","displayDocTitle":"Consensus Based Estimation Over Relay Assisted Sensor Networks for Situation Monitoring","volume":"9","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"14915223","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6971070/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2010CB731803"},{"fundingName":"NSF of China","grantNumber":"U1405251, 61221003, 61290322, 61174127 and 61273181"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Education of China","grantNumber":"NCET-13-0358, 20110073130005 and 20110073120025"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality STCSM China","grantNumber":"13QA1401900"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consensus Based Estimation Over Relay Assisted Sensor Networks for Situation Monitoring","sourcePdf":"jstsp-chen-2375851-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069923S","chronDate":"March  2015","isNumber":"7038745","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"19","articleId":"6971070","onlineDate":"02 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6971072,"authors":[{"name":"Satish Anamalamudi","affiliation":["Wireless Communication and Networking Laboratory, School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/7416301/6971072/anama-2367504-small.gif","p":["\nSatish Anamalamudi received the B.Eng. degree in computer science and \nengineering from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad, India, and the M.Tech. degree in network and \nInternet engineering from Karunya University, Coimbatore, India.

Hence, the design of CCC in CR-MAC plays a pivotal role in selecting an energy-efficient channel path for enhanced throughput. State-of-the-art CR-MAC protocols design CCC in in-band or out-of-band overlay spectrum bands. With in-band, imperfect node synchronization due to per-hop and group CCC coverage leads to multichannel hidden terminal and longer network access delays. Global coverage with dedicated out-of-band CCC is subject to saturation and intruder attacks, which results in single point of network failure and increased power consumption. To overcome existing problems, an energy-efficient hybrid CCC based CR-MAC protocol with omnidirectional control and directional data transmission is proposed to reduce power consumption due to link access overhead, multichannel hidden terminal, deafness, and spectrum mobility. In this paper, antenna index numbers through Global Positioning System and angle-of-arrival estimation are used for directional data transmission, whereas hybrid CCC is used to avoid interference due to multichannel hidden terminals. Experimental results reveal that the proposed hybrid CCC-MAC with directional antennas has increased network throughput and reduced transmit power consumption when compared with existing in/out-of-band omnidirectional CCC-based CR-MAC protocols.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971072/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2016","accessionNumber":"15802898","htmlLink":"/document/6971072/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Hybrid CCC-Based MAC Protocol for Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Hybrid CCC-Based MAC Protocol for Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"jsyst-anamalamudi-2367504-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128844S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"7416301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7416301","articleId":"6971072","onlineDate":"02 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6971074,"authors":[{"name":"Ya\u2019nan Zhou","affiliation":["Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/6994884/6971074/yzhou-2360436-small.gif","p":["Ya\u2019nan Zhou received the B.S. degree in geodesy engineering from the School of Geodesy and Geometics, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in cartography and geography information system from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in\u00a02014.","He is a Postdoctor with the State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Beijing, China.

Remote sensing has increasingly been used for water body extraction; however, in urban environments, this kind of approaches is challenging because of the significant within-class spectral variance in water areas and the presence of complex ground features. The objective of this study is to develop an automatic method that could improve water body extraction in urban environments from moderate spatial resolution satellite images. Central to our method is the combined use of multiscale extractions and spectral mixture analysis techniques in adaptive local regions. Specifically, we first calculate the NDWI image from experimental images for selecting water sample pixels. Second, on the basis of the selected water pixels, we apply an improved spectral mixture analysis technique on the experimental image to get water abundance of every pixel, and segment the abundance image to extract water bodies at the global scale. Third, in a similar manner, we iteratively conduct the water body extraction in multiscale local regions to refine the water bodies. Finally, the final result of water bodies is obtained when a stopping criterion is satisfied. We have implemented this method to produce water maps from an ALOS/AVNIR-2 image and a Terra/ASTER image covering urban areas. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed method has substantially outperformed two related methods that use the NDWI-based thresholding and the SVM classification for the entire image.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2360436","startPage":"4301","endPage":"4312","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2360436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6994884","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/6994884/06971074.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiscale Water Body Extraction in Urban Environments From Satellite Images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971074/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multiscale Water Body Extraction in Urban Environments From Satellite Images","volume":"7","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6971074/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14828784","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"International Scientific and Technological Cooperation Program of China","grantNumber":"2010DFA92720-25"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program)","grantNumber":"2013AA12A401"},{"fundingName":"National Major Program on High Resolution Earth Observation System","grantNumber":"03-Y30B06-9001-13/15-01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiscale Water Body Extraction in Urban Environments From Satellite Images","sourcePdf":"jstars-zhou-2360436-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079496S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"6994884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6994884","articleId":"6971074","onlineDate":"02 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6971096,"authors":[{"name":"Manav R.

By employing an additional transmit aperture at the transmitter along with Alamouti code, the error rate of the FSO communication system can be significantly improved. However, the pointing errors, generated because of the building sway, has the potential to eradicate the benefits of the Alamouti scheme. Therefore, for a general and realistic study of the FSO based Alamouti scheme, the effect of pointing errors in the Gamma-Gamma fading atmospheric fluctuations is considered in this paper. Specifically, we derive the symbol error rate and the average capacity of the Alamouti scheme over the Gamma-Gamma fading FSO links with pointing errors. The moment generating function (MGF) of the scheme is derived in terms of the Meijer-G function. An MGF based approach is used to derive the ergodic capacity of the scheme. The effect of pointing errors over the performance of the scheme is analyzed under different scenarios and it is observed that the pointing errors significantly degrade the diversity of the considered FSO system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971096/","volume":"4","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6971096/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14946592","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Performance of Alamouti Scheme in Gamma-Gamma Fading FSO Links With Pointing Errors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Performance of Alamouti Scheme in Gamma-Gamma Fading FSO Links With Pointing Errors","sourcePdf":"lwc-bhatnagar-2376958-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088255S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"7044619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"7044619","articleId":"6971096","onlineDate":"02 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6971101,"authors":[{"name":"Wing W.

Current methods mainly depend on either random resampling on the majority class or resampling at the decision boundary. Random-based undersampling fails to take into consideration informative samples in the data while resampling at the decision boundary is sensitive to class overlapping. Both techniques ignore the distribution information of the training dataset. In this paper, we propose a diversified sensitivity-based undersampling method. Samples of the majority class are clustered to capture the distribution information and enhance the diversity of the resampling. A stochastic sensitivity measure is applied to select samples from both clusters of the majority class and the minority class. By iteratively clustering and sampling, a balanced set of samples yielding high classifier sensitivity is selected.

These motors usually use neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) PMs. These magnets include both light rare-earth materials such as neodymium (Nd) as well as heavy rare-earth materials such as dysprosium (Dy). The main purpose of Dy is to enhance the magnet coercivity to avoid demagnetization under both high temperatures as well as flux weakening. One of the key risks in terms of using these rare-earth magnets is the significant fluctuation/increase in their prices over the past few years. Applications that use large quantities of these magnets, such as traction motors and wind generators, are the most affected by these fluctuations. There has been an ongoing global effort to try to reduce or eliminate the use of rare-earth materials (particularly Dy which is the most expensive) without sacrificing too much performance. This paper will focus on advanced spoke designs targeting traction applications. The goal of this paper is to come up with new spoke designs using various grades of Dy-free magnets as well as ferrites targeting the same set of specifications. This paper will provide a detailed comparison between the various designs highlighting the key tradeoffs in terms of power density, efficiency, flux-weakening capability, and magnet susceptibility to demagnetization. Also, a prototype using ferrites has been built and tested, and the experimental results will be presented.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6971108","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/28/7109193/06971108.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7109193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2014.2375380","startPage":"2148","endPage":"2160","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2014.2375380","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971108/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  2015","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Magnet Types on Performance of High-Speed Spoke Interior-Permanent-Magnet Machines Designed for Traction Applications","isDynamicHtml":true,"volume":"51","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6971108/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May-June 2015","accessionNumber":"15142325","isJournal":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000015","fundingName":"U.S. Department of Energy","grantNumber":"DE-E0005573"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Magnet Types on Performance of High-Speed Spoke Interior-Permanent-Magnet Machines Designed for Traction Applications","sourcePdf":"tia-elrefaie-2375380-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066472S","chronDate":"May-June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"7109193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"7109193","articleId":"6971108","onlineDate":"02 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":6971110,"authors":[{"name":"Woan Yun Hsiao","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6994894/6971110/hsiao-2371617-small.gif","p":["Woan Yun Hsiao was born in Taiwan in 1990.

A novel fuzzy state-feedback controller is designed to guarantee the resulting closed-loop system to be stochastically stable with an optimal performance. Furthermore, to make the controller design more flexible, the designed controller does not need to share membership functions and amount of fuzzy rules with the model. Some simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/7297778/06971112.pdf","startPage":"2378","endPage":"2389","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2014.2371814","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2014.2371814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7297778","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6971112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of Nonlinear Networked Systems With Packet Dropouts: Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Model-Based Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency modulation","Uncertain systems","Symmetric matrices","Stability analysis","Educational institutions","Fuzzy systems","Aerospace electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","control system synthesis","discrete time systems","fuzzy control","networked control systems","nonlinear control systems","state feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet dropout","interval type-2 fuzzy model-based approach","fuzzy control","nonlinear networked control system","closed-loop system","membership function","relative weighting function","fuzzy state-feedback controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy control","interval type-2 (IT2)","nonlinear discrete-time networked control {system} (NCS)","packet dropouts"]},{"kwd":["Fuzzy control","interval type-2 (IT2)","nonlinear discrete-time networked control system (NCS)","packet dropouts"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971112/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Control of Nonlinear Networked Systems With Packet Dropouts: Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Model-Based Approach","volume":"45","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6971112/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15520759","pubMedId":"25474817","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61333012, 61203002 and 61304003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004602","fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"NCET-13-0696"},{"fundingName":"Chinese National Post-Doctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014M551111"},{"fundingName":"Postdoctoral Science Foundation of Northeastern University"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP140102180 and LP140100471"},{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Program, China","grantNumber":"2012CB215202"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"B12018"},{"fundingName":"National Key Technology R&D Program","grantNumber":"2012BAF19G00"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of Nonlinear Networked Systems With Packet Dropouts: Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Model-Based Approach","sourcePdf":"tcyb-wu-2371814-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120097S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7297778","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"246","xplore-issue":"7297778","articleId":"6971112","onlineDate":"02 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":6971114,"authors":[{"name":"Changqiao Xu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/7140866/6971114/xu-2376138-small.gif","p":["Changqiao Xu (M\u201909) received the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS), Beijing, China, in 2009.","He was an Assistant Research Fellow with ISCAS from 2002 to 2007, where he was a Research and Development Project Manager in Communication Networks, and a Researcher with the Software Research Institute, Athlone Institute of Technology, Athlone, Ireland, from 2007 to 2009.

Stream control transmission protocol (SCTP)-based concurrent multipath transfer (CMT) improves the wireless video delivery performance with its parallel transmission and bandwidth (BW) aggregation features. However, the existing CMT solutions deployed at the transport layer only are not accurate enough due to lower layer uncertainties, such as variations of the wireless channel. In addition, CMT-based video transmission may use excessive BW in comparison with the popular Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)-based flows, which results in unfair sharing of network resources. This paper proposes a novel cross-layer fairness-driven (CL/FD) SCTP-based CMT solution (CMT-CL/FD) to improve video delivery performance, while remaining fair to the competing TCP flows. CMT-CL/FD utilizes a cross-layer approach to monitor and analyze path quality, which includes wireless channel measurements at the data-link layer and rate/BW estimations at the transport layer. Furthermore, an innovative window-based mechanism is applied for flow control to balance delivery fairness and efficiency. Finally, CMT-CL/FD intelligently distributes video data over different paths depending on their estimated quality to mitigate packet reordering and loss, under the constraint of TCP-friendly flow control. Simulation results show how CMT-CL/FD outperforms existing solutions in terms of both video delivery performance and TCP-friendliness.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2376138","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/7140866/06971114.pdf","startPage":"1175","endPage":"1189","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2376138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7140866","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer Fairness-Driven Concurrent Multipath Video Delivery Over Heterogeneous Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6971114","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971114/","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Fairness-Driven Concurrent Multipath Video Delivery Over Heterogeneous Wireless Networks","volume":"25","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15258530","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6971114/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61372112 and 61232017"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4142037"},{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Program (973 Program) of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329102"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"},{"fundingName":"Science Foundation Ireland through the International Strategic Cooperation Award","grantNumber":"SFI/13/ISCA/2845"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Fairness-Driven Concurrent Multipath Video Delivery Over Heterogeneous Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-xu-2376138-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130739S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7140866","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7140866","articleId":"6971114","onlineDate":"02 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6971115,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Sahraoui","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Electrical Engineering Laboratory of Biskra (LGEB), CISE\u2013Electromechatronic Systems Research Centre, Covilha, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/7109193/6971115/sahra-2375384-small.gif","p":["\nMohamed Sahraoui (M'12) was born in Biskra, Algeria, on May 26, 1978.

The monitoring of motor faults requires a high resolution spectrum to separate different frequency components. The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) has been widely used to achieve these requirements. However, DFT can give meaningful information only for stationary harmonics which cannot be guaranteed in real cases. In addition, a long data sequence is necessary for DFT to get high frequency resolution. Nevertheless, the signals are time varying, and the steady-state conditions can be lost for a long time acquisition. As a solution for these problems, this paper proposes an efficient time-domain technique based on a modified Prony method for the estimation of the frequencies/amplitudes of broken rotor bar faults. Using this technique, the stator current is divided into short overlapped time windows, and each one is analyzed by the least squares Prony method. The proposed technique provides a linear time-frequency/amplitude representation with high frequency resolution and adjustable time resolution. It is shown that this technique allows tracking the frequencies and amplitudes of the sidebands around the fundamental frequency component with a very high accuracy. The efficiency of the proposed method is verified by simulation and experimental tests.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-frequency analysis","Harmonic analysis","Power harmonic filters","Discrete Fourier transforms","Frequency estimation","Rotors","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude estimation","discrete Fourier transforms","fault diagnosis","frequency estimation","harmonic analysis","induction motors","rotors","stators","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified Prony method","broken rotor bar characteristic frequency tracking","three-phase induction motor","diagnostic method","motor fault","high resolution spectrum","discrete Fourier transform","DFT","stationary harmonics","data sequence","time varying signal","steady-state condition","time-domain technique","stator current","frequency estimation","amplitude estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Prony\u2019s method","Filtering; MCSA","Frequency resolution Nomenclature"]},{"kwd":["Filtering","frequency resolution nomenclature","motor current signature analysis (MCSA)","Prony's method"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIA.2014.2375384","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/28/7109193/06971115.pdf","startPage":"2136","endPage":"2147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7109193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2014.2375384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Use of a Modified Prony Method to Track the Broken Rotor Bar Characteristic Frequencies and Amplitudes in Three-Phase Induction Motors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6971115","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Use of a Modified Prony Method to Track the Broken Rotor Bar Characteristic Frequencies and Amplitudes in Three-Phase Induction Motors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971115/","volume":"51","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May-June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6971115/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15142318","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Use of a Modified Prony Method to Track the Broken Rotor Bar Characteristic Frequencies and Amplitudes in Three-Phase Induction Motors","sourcePdf":"tia-sahraoui-2375384-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091246S","chronDate":"May-June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"7109193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7109193","articleId":"6971115","onlineDate":"02 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6971116,"authors":[{"name":"Jeong-Hun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Brain and Cognitive Engineering, Korea University, Seongbuk-ku, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7333/7240149/6971116/6971116-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jeong-Hun Kim received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering and avionics from Korea Aerospace University, Gyeonggi-do, Korea, in 2009, and the MS degree in brain and cognitive engineering from the Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 2014.","He is currently working at LIG Nex1.

Applications of BCI include neurorehabilitation after stroke and control of limb prostheses. Until now, most studies have tested simple movement trajectories in two dimensions by using constant velocity profiles. However, most real-world scenarios require much more complex movement trajectories and velocity profiles. In this study, we decoded motor commands in three dimensions from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings while the subjects either executed or observed/imagined complex upper limb movement trajectories. We compared the accuracy of simple linear methods and nonlinear methods. In line with previous studies our results showed that linear decoders are an efficient and robust method for decoding motor commands. However, while we took the same precautions as previous studies to suppress eye-movement related EEG contamination, we found that subtracting residual electro-oculogram activity from the EEG data resulted in substantially lower motor decoding accuracy for linear decoders. This effect severely limits the transfer of previous results to practical applications in which neural activation is targeted. We observed that nonlinear methods showed no such drop in decoding performance. Our results demonstrate that eye-movement related contamination of brain signals constitutes a severe problem for decoding motor signals from EEG data. These results are important for developing accurate decoders of motor signal from neural signals for use with BCI-based neural prostheses and neurorehabilitation in real-world scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2014.2375879","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7333/7240149/06971116.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2014.2375879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7240149","startPage":"867","endPage":"876","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoding Three-Dimensional Trajectory of Executed and Imagined Arm Movements From Electroencephalogram Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6971116","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Decoding Three-Dimensional Trajectory of Executed and Imagined Arm Movements From Electroencephalogram Signals","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971116/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15432919","pubMedId":"25474811","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6971116/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100005960","fundingName":"Korea Society"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoding Three-Dimensional Trajectory of Executed and Imagined Arm Movements From Electroencephalogram Signals","sourcePdf":"tnsre-lee-2375879-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051629S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"7240149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"7240149","articleId":"6971116","onlineDate":"02 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6971126,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Becker","affiliation":["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Computer Vision Lab, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Becker","id":"37075031300"},{"name":"C.

However, the amount of human annotation effort required to analyze them remains a major bottleneck. While machine learning algorithms can be used to help automate this process, they require training data, which is time-consuming to obtain manually, especially in image stacks. Furthermore, due to changing experimental conditions, successive stacks often exhibit differences that are severe enough to make it difficult to use a classifier trained for a specific one on another. This means that this tedious annotation process has to be repeated for each new stack. In this paper, we present a domain adaptation algorithm that addresses this issue by effectively leveraging labeled examples across different acquisitions and significantly reducing the annotation requirements. Our approach can handle complex, nonlinear image feature transformations and scales to large microscopy datasets that often involve high-dimensional feature spaces and large 3D data volumes. We evaluate our approach on four challenging electron and light microscopy applications that exhibit very different image modalities and where annotation is very costly. Across all applications we achieve a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art machine learning methods and demonstrate our ability to greatly reduce human annotation effort.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971126/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15091936","pubMedId":"25474809","volume":"34","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6971126/","publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Domain Adaptation for Microscopy Imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Domain Adaptation for Microscopy Imaging","sourcePdf":"tmi-becker-2376872-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051501S","chronDate":"May  2015","isNumber":"7097751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"12","articleId":"6971126","onlineDate":"02 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6971128,"authors":[{"name":"Alain Rakotomamonjy","affiliation":["LITIS EA 4108, Universit\u00e9 de Rouen, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570655/7010069/6971128/6971128-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alain Rakotomamonjy has been a Professor in the Physics Department at the University of Rouen since 2006.

The approach uses a lumped capacitor in the middle of a slotted patch antenna, which results in two resonant frequencies. The two resonant frequencies and their ratio are functions of the capacitance value. If a varactor with an appropriate biasing network is used, electronic tuning is realized by changing the applied DC voltage. To understand the dual-resonance behavior of the proposed antenna, an equivalent circuit model based on the transmission line theory of the antenna is established, considering the slot effect and the lumped capacitor. The results are verified with full wave simulation. Furthermore, measurements for fabricated antenna prototypes operating in 2-4.5 GHz are carried out for validation, and the performance shows a tunable frequency ratio from 1.45 to 1.93 with a capacitance range from 0.31 to 0.74 pF.

The core idea of FV-MOEA is that the HV contribution of a solution is only associated with partial solutions rather than the whole solution set. Thus, the time cost of FV-MOEA can be greatly reduced by deleting irrelevant solutions. Experimental studies on 44 benchmark multiobjective optimization problems with 2-5 objectives in platform jMetal demonstrate that FV-MOEA not only reports higher hypervolumes than the five classical MOEAs (nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGAII), strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 (SPEA2), multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D), indicator-based evolutionary algorithm, and S-metric selection based evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm (SMS-EMOA)), but also obtains significant speedup compared to other HV indicator-based MOEAs.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2014.2367526","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/7265130/06971144.pdf","startPage":"2202","endPage":"2213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2014.2367526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7265130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simple and Fast Hypervolume Indicator-Based Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6971144","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971144/","displayDocTitle":"A Simple and Fast Hypervolume Indicator-Based Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm","volume":"45","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15456905","pubMedId":"25474815","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6971144/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"A*Star-Thematic Strategic Research Programme funding, Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology-Nanyang Technological University (SIMTech-NTU) Joint Laboratory and Collaborative Research Programme on Complex Systems"},{"fundingName":"Computational Intelligence Research Laboratory at NTU"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simple and Fast Hypervolume Indicator-Based Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tcyb-jiang-2367526-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.173322S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7265130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"7265130","articleId":"6971144","onlineDate":"02 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":6971146,"authors":[{"name":"Dongbin Zhao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7010866/6971146/zhao-2371046-small.gif","p":["Dongbin Zhao (M\u201906\u2013SM\u201910) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in materials processing engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 1994, 1996, and 2000, respectively.","He was a Post-Doctoral Fellow in Humanoid Robot with the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, from 2000 to 2002.

We use a grid to partition the continuous state space into different cells to save samples. A near-upper Q operator is defined to produce a near-upper Q function using samples in each cell. The corresponding greedy policy effectively balances between exploration and exploitation. With the rigorous analysis, we prove that there is a polynomial time bound of executing nonoptimal actions in our algorithm. After finite steps, the final policy reaches near optimal in the framework of PAC. The implementation requires no knowledge of systems and has less computation complexity.

All of them occurred during the cold season from February to April in the years 1997 to 1999. Three of them were initiated without nearby preceding lightning activity (called \u201cself-initiated\u201d upward lightning) and the other three occurred during nearby lightning activity (called \u201cother-triggered\u201d upward lightning). The analysis suggests that the other-triggered upward lightning is a downward lightning involving a relatively long upward connecting leader. The first current component, however, was different from the current of a first return stroke of a positive cloud-to-ground flash. On average, the duration was 15.7 ms, the maximum was 4.37 kA, and the charge was 13.3 C. Due to the long duration and the relatively low current, the first current component is more consistent with the initial continuous current (ICC) of an upward lightning. The initial period of the ICC exhibits a slowly rising portion lasting about 1 ms. During that period, the ICC was superimposed by weak current pulses. The arithmetic means of the pulse peak and the pulse duration were 0.49 kA and 9.6 \u03bcs, respectively.

The ICC immediately increased to several kilo-amperes involving strong current pulsation. For the ICC, the arithmetic means were 58 ms for the duration, 6.4 kA for the maximum, and 105 C for the charge.

In the GANC scheme, the relay receives interfered signals from the two sources and generates signals to be transmitted with a relay function. We focus on the design of the optimal relay function to achieve the minimum pair-wise error probability (PEP) of the system. Specifically, we first covert the relay function optimization problem to a transformation matrix (TM) design problem by presenting the received complex signals as signal matrices composed of real and imaginary parts. Then, we propose an optimization criteria, i.e., maximizing the minimal squared Euclidean distance (MMSED), to improve the PEP performance, since the PEP is determined by the Euclidean distance of the received constellation at destination. Next, we prove that the MMSED can be equivalently converted to a convex problem by introducing an intermediate matrix. We solve this convex problem by using the Lagrangian method and obtain the closed-form expression of the optimal TM.

Firstly, we present a novel approach to AUHB-DWR that aims to improve image quality. We formulate the reconstruction of an apparent DW image as a hidden conditional random field (HCRF) in which tissue model diffusion parameters act as hidden states in this random field. The second contribution of this paper is a new generation of fully connected conditional random fields, called the hidden stochastically fully connected conditional random fields (HSFCRF) that allows for efficient inference with significantly reduced computational complexity via stochastic clique structures. The proposed AUHB-DWR algorithms, HCRF and HSFCRF, are evaluated quantitatively in nine different patient cases using Fisher's criteria, probability of error, and coefficient of variation metrics to validate its effectiveness for the purpose of improving intensity delineation between expert identified suspected cancerous and healthy tissue within the prostate gland. The proposed methods are also examined using a prostate phantom, where the apparent ultra-high b-value DW images reconstructed using the tested AUHB-DWR methods are compared with real captured UHB-DWI. The results illustrate that the proposed AUHB-DWR methods has improved reconstruction quality and improved intensity delineation compared with existing AUHB-DWR approaches.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7097751","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/7097751/06971171.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2014.2376781","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2014.2376781","startPage":"1111","endPage":"1124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Apparent Ultra-High --Value Diffusion-Weighted Image Reconstruction via Hidden Conditional Random Fields","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971171/","displayDocTitle":"Apparent Ultra-High <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$b$</tex></formula>-Value Diffusion-Weighted Image Reconstruction via Hidden Conditional Random Fields","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6971171/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"34","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"15091935","pubMedId":"25474807","dateOfInsertion":"29 April 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Apparent Ultra-High <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$b$</tex></formula>-Value Diffusion-Weighted Image Reconstruction via Hidden Conditional Random Fields","sourcePdf":"tmi-shafiee-2376781-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138115S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"7097751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7097751","articleId":"6971171","onlineDate":"02 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6971174,"authors":[{"name":"Panagiotis-Agis Oikonomou-Filandras","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Panagiotis-Agis","lastName":"Oikonomou-Filandras","id":"37085570100"},{"name":"Kai-Kit Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Kai-Kit","lastName":"Wong","id":"37278682500"},{"name":"Yangyang Zhang","affiliation":["Kuang-Chi Institute of Advanced Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Yangyang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405814400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"6971174","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":667},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Convergence","Belief propagation","Schedules","Message passing","Licenses","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","signal detection","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic residual belief propagation","distributed wireless networks","cooperative spectrum sensing","SR-BP","probability distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative spectrum sensing","distributed inference","message passing","residual belief propagation"]},{"kwd":["Cooperative spectrum sensing","distributed inference","message passing","residual belief propagation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6971174","abstract":"This letter devises a novel algorithm for cooperative spectrum sensing based on belief propagation (BP) for distributed wireless networks.

We demonstrate that SR-BP converges to a unique fixed point under conditions similar to those ensuring convergence of asynchronous BP. Then, we develop a way to derive a probability distribution from the residual of each message. Finally, we provide numerical results to showcase the improvements in convergence speed, message overhead and detection accuracy of SR-BP.","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2014.2376562","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2014.2376562","startPage":"90","endPage":"93","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/7044619/06971174.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7044619","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Informed Scheduling by Stochastic Residual Belief Propagation in Distributed Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Informed Scheduling by Stochastic Residual Belief Propagation in Distributed Wireless Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","volume":"4","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6971174/","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"14946586","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971174/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/H011536/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Informed Scheduling by Stochastic Residual Belief Propagation in Distributed Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"lwc-oikonomoufilandras-2376562-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077555S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"7044619","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7044619","articleId":"6971174","onlineDate":"02 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6971188,"authors":[{"name":"Avik Sengupta","affiliation":["Hume Center for National Security and Technology, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/7000004/6971188/sengu-2375553-small.gif","p":["Avik Sengupta (S\u201911) is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA, where he is also with the Hume Center for National Security and Technology.

The main idea behind caching is to store parts of the popular content in end-users' memory and leverage the locally stored content to reduce peak data rates. By jointly designing content placement and delivery mechanisms, recent works have shown order-wise reduction in transmission rates in contrast to traditional methods. In this paper, we consider the secure caching problem with the additional goal of minimizing information leakage to an external wiretapper. The fundamental cache memory versus transmission rate tradeoff for the secure caching problem is characterized. Rather surprisingly, these results show that security can be introduced at a negligible cost, particularly for large number of files and users. It is also shown that the rate achieved by the proposed caching scheme with secure delivery is within a constant multiplicative factor from the information-theoretic optimal rate for almost all parameter values of practical interest.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2014.2375553","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7000004/06971188.pdf","startPage":"355","endPage":"370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7000004","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2014.2375553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamental Limits of Caching With Secure Delivery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6971188","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental Limits of Caching With Secure Delivery","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971188/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14847020","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6971188/","volume":"10","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental Limits of Caching With Secure Delivery","sourcePdf":"tifs-tandon-2375553-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153017S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7000004","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"7000004","articleId":"6971188","onlineDate":"02 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6971189,"authors":[{"name":"Jinhui Wang","affiliation":["College of Electronic Information and Control Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/7430016/6971189/wang-small.gif","p":["Jinhui Wang received the BE degree in electrical engineering from\n Hebei University, Hebei, China, in 2004, and the PhD degree in electrical engineering through a joint US/China program\n between University of Rochester and Beijing University of Technology, in 2010.

The circuit- and architectural- level implementation schemes of cNV SRAM are developed considering multiple key performance parameters including energy dissipation, access time, write time, noise margin, layout area, restoration time, and injection charges. Simulation results on SPEC 2000 benchmark suite demonstrate that cNV SRAM realizes 86 percent energy savings on average with negligible performance impact and small hardware overhead as compared to conventional SRAM. Finally, the impact of the sleep time and memory size on the effectiveness of cNV SRAM is analyzed in detail and it shows that cNV SRAM is particularly effective to implement large on-chip memories with long idle time.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7430016","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7430016/06971189.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TC.2014.2375187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2014.2375187","startPage":"1055","endPage":"1067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"cNV SRAM: CMOS Technology Compatible Non-Volatile SRAM Based Ultra-Low Leakage Energy Hybrid Memory System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971189/","displayDocTitle":"cNV SRAM: CMOS Technology Compatible Non-Volatile SRAM Based Ultra-Low Leakage Energy Hybrid Memory System","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6971189/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"65","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"15852811","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2016","publicationDate":"1 April 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ND EPSCoR","grantNumber":"FAR0023939, FAR0024038 and FAR0022051"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61204040"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4152004"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Education of China","grantNumber":"20121103120018"},{"fundingName":"The Plan Program of Beijing Education Science and Technology Committee","grantNumber":"JC002999201301"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"cNV SRAM: CMOS Technology Compatible Non-Volatile SRAM Based Ultra-Low Leakage Energy Hybrid Memory System","sourcePdf":"tc-wang-2375187-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.19408S","chronDate":"April 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7430016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7430016","articleId":"6971189","onlineDate":"02 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6971201,"authors":[{"name":"Huanqing Wang","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Physics, Bohai University, Jinzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/7287855/6971201/wang-small.gif","p":["Huanqing Wang received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics from Bohai\n University, Jinzhou, China, in 2003, the M.Sc. degree in mathematics from Inner Mongolia University, Huhhot, China, in\n 2006, and the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Complexity Science, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China, in 2013.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Mathematics and Physics, Bohai University, Jinzhou, China.\n His research interests include nonlinear control, adaptive fuzzy control, and stochastic nonlinear systems."]},"firstName":"Huanqing","lastName":"Wang","id":"38466729800"},{"name":"Xiaoping Liu","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/7287855/6971201/liu-small.gif","p":["Xiaoping Liu received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in\n electrical engineering from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 1984, 1987, and 1989, respectively.","He was with the School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, for more than 10 years.

A variable separation approach is introduced to overcome the design difficulty from the nonstrict-feedback structure. Mamdani-type fuzzy logic systems are utilized to model the unknown nonlinear functions in the process of controller design, and an adaptive fuzzy tracking controller is systematically designed by using a backstepping technique. It is shown that the proposed controller guarantees that all signals in the closed-loop system are fourth-moment semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, and the tracking error eventually converges to a small neighborhood of the origin in the sense of mean quartic value. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our results.

Emerging spintronics nanodevices-based hybrid logic-in-memory architecture has recently been investigated to overcome these issues. Among them, spin-transfer-torque-based magnetic tunnel junction (STT-MTJ) nanopillar is one of the most promising spintronics nanodevices thanks to its nonvolatility, fast access speed, and 3-D integration with CMOS technology. However, hybrid STTMTJ/CMOS logic faces severe reliability issues in ultradeep submicron technology nodes (e.g., 28 nm) due to the increasing process variations and reduced supply voltage. This paper presents architecture designs and comparative study of multicontext hybrid STT-MTJ/CMOS logic structures with a particular focus on reliability investigation. Their merits and shortcomings are demonstrated depending on the addressed applications. Finally, some design considerations and strategies are also presented to further optimize their reliability performance. Transient and Monte Carlo statistical analyses are performed by using an industrial CMOS 28-nm design kit and a physics-based STT-MTJ nanopillar compact model to exhibit their functionalities and effectiveness.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2014.2375205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7004754","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2014.2375205","endPage":"177","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel7/7729/7004754/06971206.pdf","startPage":"169","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design Optimization and Analysis of Multicontext STT-MTJ/CMOS Logic Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971206/","displayDocTitle":"Design Optimization and Analysis of Multicontext STT-MTJ/CMOS Logic Circuits","volume":"14","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"14870157","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6971206/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"French national research agencies"},{"fundingName":"Project DIPMEM"},{"fundingName":"CSC exchange program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Optimization and Analysis of Multicontext STT-MTJ/CMOS Logic Circuits","sourcePdf":"tnano-zhao-2375205-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104449S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"7004754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7004754","articleId":"6971206","onlineDate":"02 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6971209,"authors":[{"name":"Xuejun Pei","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7112252/6971209/pei-small.gif","p":["Xuejun Pei (M\u201912) received the B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees in\n electrical engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 1998, 2001, and 2004,\n respectively.","In 2004, he joined the Huazhong University of Science and Technology as a Teaching Assistant, where since 2006, he\n has been an Associate Professor with the College of Electrical and Electronic Engineering.

Based on the symmetrical components method, the dc-link average and harmonic rms currents are derived, and the dc-link voltage ripple is compared between the balanced and unbalanced loads. It can be found that the dc-link current and voltage ripples consist of not only high frequency harmonics but also the double fundamental frequency harmonic, and the voltage ripple is independent of the positive-sequence component and determined by the negative-sequence component, under the unbalanced load. Experimental results are shown to verify the accuracy of the theoretical analysis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and Calculation of DC-Link Current and Voltage Ripples for Three-Phase Inverter With Unbalanced Load","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2014.2375353","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7112252/06971209.pdf","startPage":"5401","endPage":"5412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2014.2375353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7112252","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6971209","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971209/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Calculation of DC-Link Current and Voltage Ripples for Three-Phase Inverter With Unbalanced Load","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6971209/","dateOfInsertion":"22 May 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15144575","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Power Electronics Science and Education Development Program of Delta Environmental & Educational Foundation","grantNumber":"2013001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Calculation of DC-Link Current and Voltage Ripples for Three-Phase Inverter With Unbalanced Load","sourcePdf":"tpel-pei-2375353-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080638S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7112252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"7112252","articleId":"6971209","onlineDate":"02 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6971212,"authors":[{"name":"Samer S.

To assess the efficacy of the SWIPT, we target a practically relevant scenario characterized by imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter, the presence of penalties associated to the CSI acquisition procedures, and non-zero power consumption for the operations performed by the UT, such as CSI estimation, uplink signaling and data decoding. We analyze three different cases for the CSI knowledge at the AP: no CSI, and imperfect CSI in case of time-division duplexing and frequency-division duplexing communications. Closed-form representations of the ergodic downlink rate and both the energy shortage and data outage probability are derived for the three cases. Additionally, analytic expressions for the ergodically optimal duration of power transfer and channel estimation/feedback phases are provided.

The full-duplex operation can reduce the overall communication to only one phase but suffers from the self-interference. Instead of purely suppressing the self-interference, we aim to maximize the end-to-end performance by jointly optimizing the beamforming matrix at the relay which uses the amplify-and-forward protocol as well as the power control at the sources. To be specific, we propose iterative algorithms and 1-D search to solve two problems: finding the achievable rate region and maximizing the sum rate. At each iteration, either the analytical solution or convex formulation is obtained. We compare the proposed full-duplex two-way relaying with the conventional half-duplex two-way relaying, a full-duplex one-way relaying and a performance upper bound. Numerical results show that the proposed full-duplex scheme significantly improves the achievable data rates over the conventional scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2376885","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2376885","startPage":"555","endPage":"566","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6994902/06971223.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6994902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Beamforming Optimization and Power Control for Full-Duplex MIMO Two-Way Relay Channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971223/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1,  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Joint Beamforming Optimization and Power Control for Full-Duplex MIMO Two-Way Relay Channel","volume":"63","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14834918","publicationDate":"Feb.1, 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6971223/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Beamforming Optimization and Power Control for Full-Duplex MIMO Two-Way Relay Channel","sourcePdf":"tsp-zheng-2376885-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104959S","chronDate":"Feb.1,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6994902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"125","xplore-issue":"6994902","articleId":"6971223","onlineDate":"02 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6971233,"authors":[{"name":"Fotis Foukalas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"],"bio":{"p":["\nFotis Foukalas (M'12) received the Diploma degree in electrical and computer engineering with a focus on telecommunications from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece; the M.Sc. degree in information and communications technologies from the National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece; and the Ph.D. degree in wireless mobile communications from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.","He is a Research Fellow with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar, and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Thessaly, Volos, Greece.

Nevertheless, relaying of primary packets may introduce delays on secondary packets called secondary delay and may require an additional power budget to forward the primary packets. Power budget is particularly crucial when a type of sensor network is deployed using devices of limited power resources. In this paper, admission control is employed to efficiently manage this packet-wise relaying process in cognitive radio sensor networks (CRSNs). To be specific, we assume a cognitive packet-relaying scenario with two pairs of primary and secondary users, i.e., transmitter and receiver. We analyze and formulate the secondary delay and the required power budget of the secondary sensor node in relation to the acceptance factor (i.e., admission control parameter) that indicates whether the primary packets are admitted for relaying or not. Having defined the above, we present a tradeoff between the secondary delay and the required power budget by tuning the acceptance factor, which can be tailored to specific chosen values. Based on this behavior, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the secondary delay over the admission control parameter subject to a limit on the required power budget. Additionally, the constraints related to the stabilities of all individual queues at the primary and secondary networks are taken into account in the proposed optimization problem, due to their interdependence relations. The solution of this problem is provided using iterative decomposition methods, i.e., dual and primal decompositions, using Lagrange multipliers that simplify the original complicated problem and result in a final equivalent dual problem that includes the initial Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. We obtain the optimal acceptance factor, while in addition, we highlight the opportunities for extra delay minimization that is provided by relaxing the initial constraints through changing the values of the Lagrange multipliers. Finally, we present the behavior of the secondary delay, assuming infinite and finite queues and assessing thereby the overflow and blocking probabilities, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2376944","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7323911/06971233.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7323911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2376944","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"5221","endPage":"5231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"To Relay or Not to Relay in Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6971233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"To Relay or Not to Relay in Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971233/","volume":"64","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6971233/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15587074","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Priorities Research Program (NPRP)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"To Relay or Not to Relay in Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-foukalas-2376944-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09261S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7323911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7323911","articleId":"6971233","onlineDate":"02 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6971234,"authors":[{"name":"Domenico Ciuonzo","affiliation":["DIETI, University of Naples \u201cFederico II\u201d, Naples, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Domenico Ciuonzo (S'11\u2013M'14) was born in Aversa, Italy, on June 29th, 1985.

The importance of low-energy protons to system-level single-event performance is based on the technology under investigation as well as the target radiation environment.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2014.2369171","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/23/6976033/06971236.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2014.2369171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976033","startPage":"2896","endPage":"2903","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Criticality of Low-Energy Protons in Single-Event Effects Testing of Highly-Scaled Technologies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6971236","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Criticality of Low-Energy Protons in Single-Event Effects Testing of Highly-Scaled Technologies","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971236/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14824111","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6971236/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Criticality of Low-Energy Protons in Single-Event Effects Testing of Highly-Scaled Technologies","sourcePdf":"tns-pellish-2369171-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080342S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"6976033","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6976033","articleId":"6971236","onlineDate":"02 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6971238,"authors":[{"name":"Mostafa Darvishi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, \u00c9cole Polytechnique, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Mostafa","lastName":"Darvishi","id":"37085525254"},{"name":"Yves Audet","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, \u00c9cole Polytechnique, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Audet","id":"37273900300"},{"name":"Yves Blaqui\u00e8re","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Blaqui\u00e8re","id":"37352099300"},{"name":"Claude Thibeault","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, \u00c9cole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Claude","lastName":"Thibeault","id":"37276569100"},{"name":"Simon Pichette","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, \u00c9cole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Pichette","id":"38529137300"},{"name":"Fatima Zahra Tazi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, \u00c9cole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Fatima Zahra","lastName":"Tazi","id":"37085480925"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1578"}],"articleNumber":"6971238","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":367},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circuit Level Modeling of Extra Combinational Delays in SRAM-Based FPGAs Due to Transient Ionizing Radiation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6971238","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Field programmable gate arrays","Integrated circuit interconnections","Integrated circuit modeling","Ionizing radiation","Transistors","SRAM cells","Single event upsets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinational circuits","delays","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit interconnections","integrated circuit modelling","radiation hardening (electronics)","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit level modeling","extra combinational delays","SRAM-Based FPGAs","transient ionizing radiation","Virtex-5","single event upsets","SEUs","circuit architecture","configurable logic blocks","CLBs","routing","extra interconnection lines","circuit path","pass transistors","delay faults","input-ouput blocks","IOBs","proton irradiation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Configurable logic element","extra combinational delays","IBIS model","Input/Ouput Blocks (IOBs)","observed delay change (ODC)","single event upset (SEU)","SRAM-based FPGA"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents circuit level models that explain the extra combinational delays in a SRAM-based FPGA (Virtex-5) due to Single Event Upsets (SEUs). Several scenarios of extra combinational delays are simulated based on the circuit architecture of the FPGA core, namely Configurable Logic Blocks (CLBs) and routing. It is found that the main delay contribution originates from extra interconnection lines that are unintentionally connected to the main circuit path via pass transistors activated by SEUs. Moreover, longer delay faults observed on Input/Ouput Blocks (IOBs) due to SEU were investigated through simulations. In all cases, results are in close agreement with the ones obtained experimentally while exposing the FPGA to proton irradiation.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2014.2369424","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2014.2369424","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/23/6976033/06971238.pdf","startPage":"3535","endPage":"3542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976033","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971238/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Circuit Level Modeling of Extra Combinational Delays in SRAM-Based FPGAs Due to Transient Ionizing Radiation","volume":"61","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14824084","htmlLink":"/document/6971238/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circuit Level Modeling of Extra Combinational Delays in SRAM-Based FPGAs Due to Transient Ionizing Radiation","sourcePdf":"tns-darvishi-2369424-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082889S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"6976033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6976033","articleId":"6971238","onlineDate":"02 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6971241,"authors":[{"name":"Slawosz Uznanski","affiliation":["Technology Department, European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Slawosz","lastName":"Uznanski","id":"37540583700"},{"name":"Ruben Garcia Alia","affiliation":["Engineering Department, European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Ruben Garcia","lastName":"Alia","id":"37073003100"},{"name":"Ewart Blackmore","affiliation":["TRIUMF Laboratory, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Ewart","lastName":"Blackmore","id":"37283487700"},{"name":"Markus Brugger","affiliation":["Engineering Department, European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Brugger","id":"37864087700"},{"name":"Remi Gaillard","affiliation":["Saint-Arnoult-en-Yvelines, France"],"firstName":"Remi","lastName":"Gaillard","id":"37085426959"},{"name":"Julien Mekki","affiliation":["Engineering Department, European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Mekki","id":"37540588900"},{"name":"Benjamin Todd","affiliation":["Technology Department, European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Todd","id":"37841466000"},{"name":"Michael Trinczek","affiliation":["TRIUMF Laboratory, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Trinczek","id":"37317831300"},{"name":"Andrea Vilar Villanueva","affiliation":["Technology Department, European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Andrea Vilar","lastName":"Villanueva","id":"37085486847"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1578"}],"articleNumber":"6971241","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":487},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tungsten","Protons","SRAM cells","Monte Carlo methods","Thin film transistors","Large Hadron Collider","Single event upsets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","DRAM chips","Monte Carlo methods","proton effects","radiation hardening (electronics)","SRAM chips","thin film transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["proton energy effect","SEU cross section","16 Mbit TFT PMOS SRAM","16-Mbit thin film transistor","PMOS static random access memory","DRAM capacitors","high-Z materials","single event upset","SEU proton cross section","Monte Carlo simulations","LHC","large hadron collider"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)","Large Hadron Collider (LHC)","proton","single event upset (SEU)","static random access memory (SRAM)","tungsten"]}],"abstract":"Proton experimental data are analyzed for a 16-Mbit thin-film-transistor (TFT) PMOS static random access memory (SRAM) with DRAM capacitors.

The buildup of oxide-trapped charge in the shallow trench isolation turns on a parasitic transistor, leading to increased leakage current (higher IOFF.) The TID-induced degradation increases with decreasing fin width. Transistors with longer channels degrade less than those with shorter channels.

In our approach, the analysis of the entire response of the structure at hand (e.g., S-parameters as a function of frequency) is replaced by response surface modeling of suitably selected feature points. On the one hand, this is sufficient to determine whether a design satisfies given performance specifications. On the other, by exploiting the almost linear dependence of the feature points on the designable parameters of the structure, reliable yield estimates can be realized at low computational cost. Our methodology is verified using two examples of waveguide filters and one microstrip hairpin filter and compared with conventional Monte Carlo analysis based on repetitive electromagnetic simulations, as well as with statistical analysis exploiting linear response expansions around the nominal design. Finally, we perform yield-driven design optimizations on these filters.","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7000613/06971248.pdf","startPage":"107","endPage":"114","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave

logic circuits by using spin-transfer-torque (STT)-magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) devices. Since a bidirectional write current is required for STT switching, data-dependent write-completion monitoring, where the node with large voltage difference between before and after the switching is selectively used, makes it possible to achieve sufficiently large sense margin at any write current directions. By the enhancement of sense margin, write-completion monitoring and self-write-termination circuitries are simplified. Thus, 60% of transistor counts reduction and further robust write-completion detection under process variation are achieved in comparison with those of the prior work.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2014.2322387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2014.2322387","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/6971254/06971313.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6971254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost-Efficient Self-Terminated Write Driver for Spin-Transfer-Torque RAM and Logic","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971313/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Cost-Efficient Self-Terminated Write Driver for Spin-Transfer-Torque RAM and Logic","volume":"50","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2014","isJournal":true,"externalId":"3402104","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14787216","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6971313/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-Efficient Self-Terminated Write Driver for Spin-Transfer-Torque RAM and Logic","sourcePdf":"tmag-suzuki-2322387-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06357S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6971254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6971254","articleId":"6971313","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6971319,"authors":[{"name":"Euiseok Hwang","affiliation":["Avago Technologies, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Euiseok","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37337952600"},{"name":"Nilton Azevedo","affiliation":["Avago Technologies, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Nilton","lastName":"Azevedo","id":"37085468292"},{"name":"Chad Rabbitt","affiliation":["Avago Technologies, Longmont, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Chad","lastName":"Rabbitt","id":"37085408677"},{"name":"Ken Hall","affiliation":["Avago Technologies, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Hall","id":"37085465462"},{"name":"Jongseung Park","affiliation":["Avago Technologies, Allentown, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jongseung","lastName":"Park","id":"38548158300"},{"name":"George Mathew","affiliation":["Avago Technologies, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Mathew","id":"37279376700"},{"name":"Suharli Tedja","affiliation":["Avago Technologies, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Suharli","lastName":"Tedja","id":"37390623800"},{"name":"Richard Rauschmayer","affiliation":["Avago Technologies, Longmont, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Rauschmayer","id":"37846593300"},{"name":"Bruce Wilson","affiliation":["Avago Technologies, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bruce","lastName":"Wilson","id":"37283007100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"6971319","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6971319","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Magnetic recording","Bit error rate","Equalizers","Media","Servomotors","Tunneling magnetoresistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["disc drives","hard discs","magnetic recording","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","array-reader","drive-tap measurement platform","ARMR","magnetic hard disk drives","signal processing","multiple readback streams","data retrieval","track squeezes","single-reader system","realistic drive environments","linear bit density conditions","optimal bit-aspect ratio-based areal density capability","ADC gain","head-media","shingled magnetic recording","outer diameter","OD","perpendicular magnetic recording"]},{"kwd":["2-D equalizer","2-D magnetic recording (TDMR)","array-reader","array-reader-based magnetic recording (ARMR)","hard disk drives (HDD)","magnetic recording"]}],"abstract":"Array-reader-based magnetic recording (ARMR) is one of the promising candidates to achieve areal density beyond 1 Tb/in\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n in magnetic hard disk drives.

The drive-tap interface of the platform can control track squeeze and linear bit density conditions, and optimal bit-aspect ratio-based areal density capability (ADC) can be assessed with this platform.

The approach differs from the conventional interior permanent magnet motors, in which the reluctance torque due to saliency reaches a maximum value at a current phase angle located 45 electrical degrees with respect to the maximum value obtained from the magnetic torque produced by the rotor magnets. The adoption of assisted barriers is employed to improve the torque production by creating rotor asymmetry to allow the reluctance torque and the magnetic torque reach a maximum value near or at the same current phase angle. To evaluate the contribution, the frozen permeability method is utilized to segregate the torque into its reluctance and magnetic torque components. First, an iterative optimization is performed on a concept design of a 6/4 VIPMM for demonstrating the design principle based on finite element method. Then, the VIPMM is further optimized by algorithms, such as the kriging method and genetic algorithm for improving the torque characteristics and efficiency. As a result, the optimal VIPMM with assisted barriers shows the substantially improved performance compared with a conventional design.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/6971254/06971423.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2014.2330339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2014.2330339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6971254","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6971423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Design of a Novel V-Type Interior Permanent Magnet Motor with Assisted Barriers for the Improvement of Torque Characteristics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Reluctance motors","Magnetic separation","Permanent magnet motors","Magnetomechanical effects","Rotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design engineering","finite element analysis","genetic algorithms","iterative methods","magnetic permeability","permanent magnet motors","rotors","synchronous motors","torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal design","v-type interior permanent magnet motors","assisted barriers","torque characteristics improvement","VIPMM","average torque improvement","torque ripple improvement","reluctance torque","current phase angle","magnetic torque","rotor magnets","torque production improvement","rotor asymmetry","frozen permeability method","iterative optimization","finite element method","kriging method","genetic algorithm"]},{"kwd":["Finite-element method (FEM)","frozen permeability method (FPM)","genetic algorithm (GA)","magnetic torque","optimal design","torque","torque ripple","V-type interior permanent magnet motors (VIPMMs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971423/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Design of a Novel V-Type Interior Permanent Magnet Motor with Assisted Barriers for the Improvement of Torque Characteristics","volume":"50","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6971423/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14787002","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2014","externalId":"8104504","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Design of a Novel V-Type Interior Permanent Magnet Motor with Assisted Barriers for the Improvement of Torque Characteristics","sourcePdf":"tmag-kwon-2330339-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072936S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6971254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"6971254","articleId":"6971423","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6971437,"authors":[{"name":"Xiu Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Xiu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405045500"},{"name":"S.

One solution to mitigate the effect of 2-D interference is to apply a 2-D coding scheme on an input data sequence before recording so as to avoid some data patterns that easily cause an error at the data detection process. Nonetheless, this method usually requires many redundant bits, thus lowering a code rate. This paper proposes a rate-8/9 modulation code for a multitrack multihead BPMR system to eliminate the data patterns that lead to severe 2-D interference.

It also employs permanent magnets on the iron segments to produce additional torque.

Compared with the conventional four-quadrant transducer (4QT), the proposed flux switching permanent magnet double-rotor machine (FSPM-DRM) has PMs located in the stator, and can offer better performances in terms of magnetic coupling and torque ripple, which are especially important for DRM control in HEVs. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the 4QT and FSPM-DRM by employing the finite element method (FEM). For a fair comparison, two topologies are designed under the same peripheral dimensions, current density, and copper loss. Considering the effect of skewed slots in the 4QT, the corresponding performances are calculated with multi-slice 2-D time-stepping FEM. The simulated results illustrate that the proposed FSPM-DRM offers larger output torque, lower torque ripple, and smaller magnetic coupling than the 4QT. Nevertheless, the eddy current losses in PMs and windings of the FSPM-DRM are higher than those of the 4QT. Experimental results of the FSPM-DRM prototype are also given to verify the validity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison and Analysis of Flux-Switching Permanent-Magnet Double-Rotor Machine With 4QT Used for HEV","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2014.2331313","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/6971254/06971517.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2014.2331313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6971254","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6971517","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971517/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Comparison and Analysis of Flux-Switching Permanent-Magnet Double-Rotor Machine With 4QT Used for HEV","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"50","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6971517/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2014","externalId":"8205804","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14787153","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison and Analysis of Flux-Switching Permanent-Magnet Double-Rotor Machine With 4QT Used for HEV","sourcePdf":"tmag-zhu-2331313-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052952S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6971254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6971254","articleId":"6971517","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6971529,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandre Chicharo","affiliation":["INESC-MN Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores-Microsistemas e Nanotecnologias, Lisbon, Portugal"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Chicharo","id":"37085343257"},{"name":"Filipe Cardoso","affiliation":["INESC-MN Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores-Microsistemas e Nanotecnologias, Lisbon, Portugal"],"firstName":"Filipe","lastName":"Cardoso","id":"37269059400"},{"name":"Susana Cardoso","affiliation":["INESC-MN Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores-Microsistemas e Nanotecnologias, Lisbon, Portugal"],"firstName":"Susana","lastName":"Cardoso","id":"37266515500"},{"name":"Paulo P.

The extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart can be used to predict the threshold decoding of protograph LDPC codes, however, previous works only consider the binary protograph LDPC codes in the PR channels. In this paper, we propose to perform the EXIT chart analysis on the nonbinary protograph LDPC codes for the PR channels. Unlike prior works, the actual extrinsic information of the channel detector is measured, then the extrinsic information to the variable nodes is generated with the measured statistics. Moreover, since the mutual information of the variable nodes depends on GF(q), we use the Monte Carlo method to approximate the mutual information. The analysis on the regular (2,4) code, regular (3,6) code, RA code, and AR3A code on the PR channels reveal that, for the PR! channel, the RA code outperforms the others for q = 2, 4, and 8, but the regular (2,4) code is the best for q = 16 and 32. For the PR2 channel, the RA code is the best code for q = 2 and 4, but the regular (2,4) code is the best code for q > 4. The simulation of the codes for q = 4 and 16 are then used to confirm the theoretical results.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2014.2321021","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2014.2321021","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/6971254/06971550.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6971254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EXIT Chart Analysis of Nonbinary Protograph LDPC Codes for Partial Response Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971550/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"EXIT Chart Analysis of Nonbinary Protograph LDPC Codes for Partial Response Channels","volume":"50","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14787083","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","externalId":"3101904","htmlLink":"/document/6971550/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EXIT Chart Analysis of Nonbinary Protograph LDPC Codes for Partial Response Channels","sourcePdf":"tmag-phakphisut-2321021-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088422S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6971254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6971254","articleId":"6971550","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6971556,"authors":[{"name":"Shunsuke Fukami","affiliation":["Center for Innovative Integrated Electronic Systems, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Shunsuke","lastName":"Fukami","id":"37294546600"},{"name":"Michihiko Yamanouchi","affiliation":["Laboratory for Nanoelectronics and Spintronics, Research Institute of Electrical Communication, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Michihiko","lastName":"Yamanouchi","id":"37391353900"},{"name":"Shoji Ikeda","affiliation":["Laboratory for Nanoelectronics and Spintronics, Research Institute of Electrical Communication, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Shoji","lastName":"Ikeda","id":"37286702900"},{"name":"Hideo Ohno","affiliation":["Laboratory for Nanoelectronics and Spintronics, Research Institute of Electrical Communication, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan","WPI Advanced Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideo","lastName":"Ohno","id":"37085420611"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"6971556","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":717},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6971556","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuits","Nickel","Nonhomogeneous media","Resistance","Magnetic tunneling","Wires","Writing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cobalt","logic circuits","low-power electronics","magnetic traps","nanowires","nickel","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["domain wall motion device","nonvolatile memory","DW-motion devices","current-induced magnetic domain wall motion device","four-terminal structure","three-terminal structure","logic technologies","nanowires","device properties","critical current","retention properties","writing properties","semiconductor-based cells","ultralow power capability","Co-Ni"]},{"kwd":["Co/Ni multilayer","magnetic domain wall (DW)","magnetic random access memory","scalability","spintronics"]}],"abstract":"Current-induced magnetic domain wall (DW)-motion device with a three- or four-terminal structure has considerable potential to trigger a profound transformation in memory and logic technologies.

The results reveal that writing properties are enhanced while sufficient retention properties are maintained as the device size is reduced, indicating that the DW-motion device has high scalability and compatibility with conventional semiconductor-based cells as well as ultralow power capability.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2014.2321396","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/6971254/06971556.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2014.2321396","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6971254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Domain Wall Motion Device for Nonvolatile Memory and Logic \u2014 Size Dependence of Device Properties","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971556/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Domain Wall Motion Device for Nonvolatile Memory and Logic \u2014 Size Dependence of Device Properties","volume":"50","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6971556/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14787279","externalId":"3401006","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Domain Wall Motion Device for Nonvolatile Memory and Logic \u2014 Size Dependence of Device Properties","sourcePdf":"tmag-fukami-2321396-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090174S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6971254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6971254","articleId":"6971556","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6971557,"authors":[{"name":"Guojun Han","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China","School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Guojun","lastName":"Han","id":"37667764900"},{"name":"Yong Liang Guan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yong Liang","lastName":"Guan","id":"37085410527"},{"name":"Lingjun Kong","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Posts and Communications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lingjun","lastName":"Kong","id":"37085420832"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"6971557","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":198},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"abstract":"Shingled magnetic recording (SMR) with 2-D magnetic recording has recently emerged as a promising technology to sustain the growth of magnetic storage areal density. However, with the reduction of track pitch, the intertrack interference (ITI) becomes a major impairment. Furthermore, in SMR, the ITI is non-uniform among the top and lower tracks. A 2-D read channel which makes use of an array of read heads can effectively detect and compensate the severe ITI. In this paper, based on a read-array SMR channel model with non-uniform ITI, a shuffled multi-track detection (SMTD) detector, which shuffles and propagates the most reliable extrinsic information among the upper, lower, and middle detectors, is proposed to mitigate ITI more effectively. With the optimized non-binary low-density parity-check code, the performance of the proposed SMTD over the read-array SMR channel is evaluated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

progress in nonvolatile (NV) devices, such as magnetic tunnel junctions and phase change memories, various NV logic blocks have recently been proposed to overcome energy/delay bottlenecks caused by von Neumann computing architecture. The ferroelectric tunnel memristor (FTM) is an emerging NV multilevel device and was recently reported to show excellent performance. In this paper, we demonstrated that the short-circuit effect in an FTM provides the opportunity to design a novel FTM-based Boolean logic block. This block is composed of an FTM and a load resistor. Unlike classical schemes, where at least two cells are required as operands, our FTM-based block implements logic operation inside a single memristor. With a compact model of an FTM, transient simulation is performed to validate NAND and NOR logic functions. Finally, we provide the method of performance optimization and discuss the advantages/disadvantages of the proposed logic block to summarize our work.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2014.2329774","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/6971254/06971560.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2014.2329774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6971254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonvolatile Boolean Logic Block Based on Ferroelectric Tunnel Memristor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971560/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Nonvolatile Boolean Logic Block Based on Ferroelectric Tunnel Memristor","volume":"50","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"externalId":"9100604","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14787282","htmlLink":"/document/6971560/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonvolatile Boolean Logic Block Based on Ferroelectric Tunnel Memristor","sourcePdf":"tmag-zhao-2329774-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0684S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6971254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6971254","articleId":"6971560","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6971567,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher H.

To realize secure hardware key in non-volatile devices, our methods and results are promising for constructing MTJ-PUF based on spintronic LSI devices.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2014.2325646","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2014.2325646","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/6971254/06971648.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6971254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extracting Physically Unclonable Function From Spin Transfer Switching Characteristics in Magnetic Tunnel Junctions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971648/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Extracting Physically Unclonable Function From Spin Transfer Switching Characteristics in Magnetic Tunnel Junctions","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"externalId":"3402004","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14787123","volume":"50","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6971648/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extracting Physically Unclonable Function From Spin Transfer Switching Characteristics in Magnetic Tunnel Junctions","sourcePdf":"tmag-marukame-2325646-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051858S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6971254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6971254","articleId":"6971648","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6971700,"authors":[{"name":"Kyuha Oh","affiliation":["Research and Development Center, Bio Focus Company, Ltd., Uiwang, Korea","Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Kyuha","lastName":"Oh","id":"37085438956"},{"name":"Young Soo Choi","affiliation":["Department of Biomicrosystem Technology, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Young Soo","lastName":"Choi","id":"37085430582"},{"name":"Ha Young Yoon","affiliation":["Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Ha Young","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37085427804"},{"name":"Nami Park","affiliation":["Research and Development Center, Bio Focus Company, Ltd., Uiwang, Korea"],"firstName":"Nami","lastName":"Park","id":"37085429696"},{"name":"Jooho Kim","affiliation":["Research and Development Center, Bio Focus Company, Ltd., Uiwang, Korea"],"firstName":"Jooho","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085430960"},{"name":"Young Keun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Young Keun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37311186600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"6971700","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nanoparticles","Immune system","Strips","Magnetic separation","Magnetic resonance imaging","Gold","Materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biochemistry","biomagnetism","chemical sensors","chromatography","diseases","iron compounds","magnetic particles","molecular biophysics","nanomedicine","nanoparticles","nanosensors","proteins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["immunochromatographic assay","hepatitis B surface antigen","magnetic nanoparticles","Fe3O4","detection capability","anti-HBsAg antibodies","HBsAg","signal materials"]},{"kwd":["Assay","Fe3O4 nanoparticles","hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)","immunochromatography","signal material"]}],"abstract":"An immunochromatographic assay for the detection of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was developed using Fe\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sub>\nO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sub>\n nanoparticles as signal materials.

memory technology. Its advantageous features have attracted much attention in the area of research and development, and a number of preindustrial prototypes and small-scale products have been demonstrated. One expects to widely commercialize it in the next few years. One of the critical issues that blocks STT-MRAM's wide commercialization is its low sensing reliability due to the relatively small tunnel magnetoresistance ratio of the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) and the continuously increasing process variations, especially as technology process scales down to the deep submicrometer nodes (e.g., 40 nm). In this paper, we present a variation-tolerant high-reliability sensing circuit for deep submicrometer STT-MRAM. This circuit, using triple-stage sensing and charge transfer amplification, is able to tolerate significantly the process variations and improve greatly the sensing margin by sacrificing some sensing time. Using a CMOS 40 nm design kit and a precise STT-MTJ compact model, transient and Monte Carlo simulations have been carried out to demonstrate its sensing performance.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2014.2321551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2014.2321551","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/6971254/06971743.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6971254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variation-Tolerant High-Reliability Sensing Scheme for Deep Submicrometer STT-MRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971743/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Variation-Tolerant High-Reliability Sensing Scheme for Deep Submicrometer STT-MRAM","volume":"50","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2014","isJournal":true,"externalId":"3400904","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14787344","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6971743/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variation-Tolerant High-Reliability Sensing Scheme for Deep Submicrometer STT-MRAM","sourcePdf":"tmag-zhao-2321551-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094517S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6971254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6971254","articleId":"6971743","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6971783,"authors":[{"name":"Runhong Huang","affiliation":["School of Electric Power, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Runhong","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085442071"},{"name":"Bo Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electric Power, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279402100"},{"name":"Dongyuan Qiu","affiliation":["School of Electric Power, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Dongyuan","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37085367558"},{"name":"Yuqiu Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electric Power, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yuqiu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085503543"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"6971783","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3822},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Couplings","Magnetic resonance","Wireless communication","Coils","Magnetoacoustic effects","Resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coils","inductive power transmission","magnetic fields"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency splitting phenomena","magnetic resonant coupling wireless power","WPT system","three-coil WPT","two-coil WPT","frequency characteristics","system efficiency","magnetic field distribution","tuned frequency method"]},{"kwd":["Frequency splitting","maximum transfer power","resonant coupling","wireless power transfer (WPT)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6971783","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/6971254/06971783.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2014.2331143","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2014.2331143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6971254","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency Splitting Phenomena of Magnetic Resonant Coupling Wireless Power Transfer","abstract":"In magnetic resonant coupling wireless power transfer (WPT) system, the frequency splitting phenomena have a vital influence on the output power. This paper mainly focuses on the frequency splitting of two-coil and three-coil WPT. First, the frequency characteristics of transfer power and system efficiency of the two-coil WPT are analyzed by circuit theory. In addition, the magnetic field distribution of the two splitting frequencies is simulated to analyze which frequency is better for the operating frequency. Second, considering the reference resistance of RF power, the frequency splitting of two-coil and three-coil WPT is analyzed. Finally, the critical coupling, which determines the over coupled region, of two-coil and three-coil WPT is derived. Meanwhile, we propose a tuned frequency method according to the numerical results. In addition, the transfer power can be kept at a relatively constant level in the over coupled region.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971783/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","volume":"50","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14787367","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6971783/","isJournal":true,"externalId":"8600204","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Frequency Splitting Phenomena of Magnetic Resonant Coupling Wireless Power Transfer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency Splitting Phenomena of Magnetic Resonant Coupling Wireless Power Transfer","sourcePdf":"tmag-zhang-2331143-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057524S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6971254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"6971254","articleId":"6971783","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6971795,"authors":[{"name":"Antoine Chavent","affiliation":["Crocus Technology, Grenoble, France","SPINTEC, UMR-8191, CEA-INAC, CNRS, UJF-Grenoble, Grenoble-INP, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Antoine","lastName":"Chavent","id":"38233353600"},{"name":"J\u00e9r\u00e9my Alvarez-Herault","affiliation":["Crocus Technology, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"J\u00e9r\u00e9my","lastName":"Alvarez-Herault","id":"38320795400"},{"name":"C\u00e9line Portemont","affiliation":["Crocus Technology, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"C\u00e9line","lastName":"Portemont","id":"37318451200"},{"name":"Claire Creuzet","affiliation":["Crocus Technology, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Claire","lastName":"Creuzet","id":"37085410062"},{"name":"J\u00e9r\u00e9my Pereira","affiliation":["Crocus Technology, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"J\u00e9r\u00e9my","lastName":"Pereira","id":"37085424999"},{"name":"Julien Vidal","affiliation":["Crocus Technology, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Vidal","id":"37088709957"},{"name":"Ken Mackay","affiliation":["Crocus Technology, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Mackay","id":"38363639700"},{"name":"Ricardo C.

The current densities used for heating are of the order of magnitude of the current densities at which spin-transfer torque (STT) acts as an effective field from the point of view of the thermal activation model. To seek for such combined influence of heating and STT in TAS-MRAM, statistical writing tests were performed on 1-kb test devices. The phase diagrams with the pinned and unpinned regions were obtained. A reduction of the writing field in the unpinned region was evidenced by changing the polarity, which is asymmetrical with respect to the direction of writing. This is consistent with STT influence. The order of magnitude of the effect is in good agreement with previous work on writing field dependence with the current and compares well with numerical estimates using the Neel-Brown-modified model to consider the STT effect. The writing field can be reduced by 15% by properly choosing the current direction for a current density of 2 MA/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Writing","Switches","Heating","Magnetic tunneling","Junctions","Current density","Saturation magnetization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current density","heating","magnetic switching","MRAM devices","statistical testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heating current polarity effects","thermally assisted switching-MRAM writing","thermally assisted switching-magnetic random access memory","storage layer","exchange bias","antiferromagnet","heating pulse","current density","spin-transfer torque","thermal activation model","TAS-MRAM","statistical writing tests","test devices","phase diagrams","unpinned regions","pinned regions","writing field reduction","writing field dependence","Neel-Brown-modified model","STT effect","storage capacity 1 Kbit"]},{"kwd":["Spin-transfer torque","thermally assisted magnetic random access memory (MRAM)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6971795","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2014.2322494","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/6971254/06971795.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6971254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2014.2322494","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971795/","displayDocTitle":"Effects of the Heating Current Polarity on the Writing of Thermally Assisted Switching-MRAM","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","volume":"50","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2014","isJournal":true,"externalId":"3401504","accessionNumber":"14787224","htmlLink":"/document/6971795/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of the Heating Current Polarity on the Writing of Thermally Assisted Switching-MRAM","sourcePdf":"tmag-chavent-2322494-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059995S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6971254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6971254","articleId":"6971795","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6971800,"authors":[{"name":"Lingjun Kong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong","School of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Posts and Communications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lingjun","lastName":"Kong","id":"37060910200"},{"name":"Yunxiang Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Yunxiang","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37071657100"},{"name":"Guojun Han","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Guojun","lastName":"Han","id":"37667764900"},{"name":"Francis C.

In contrast to the past work, this work presents a PCM translation layer that considers how the main memory is used by the operating system together with the usage patterns of storage by trading their performance and reliability. In particular, a joint management scheme is proposed to improve the capability of PCM as both main memory and storage so as to enhance the performance of the entire system. The endurance issue of PCM for main memory is resolved by utilizing the potentially large capacity of the PCM storage space with limited modifications to the existing operating system implementations. Moreover, three commands are proposed to help operating system engineers to take advantage of PCM as main memory and storage by reducing I/O overheads and speeding up both the initialization and termination of program executions. The experimental results show that the performance of PCM as both main memory and storage can be significantly improved with reasonable lifetime, while the system overhead is very limited under coarse-grained wear leveling.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971822/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-17 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14791665","htmlLink":"/document/6971822/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A PCM translation layer for integrated memory and storage management","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A PCM translation layer for integrated memory and storage management","confLoc":"Uttar Pradesh, India","sourcePdf":"CODESISSS1B3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077683S","chronDate":"12-17 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963814","isNumber":"6971816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963814","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6971816","articleId":"6971822","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6971826,"authors":[{"name":"Santiago Pagani","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems (CES), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany"],"firstName":"Santiago","lastName":"Pagani","id":"37071428800"},{"name":"Heba Khdr","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems (CES), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany"],"firstName":"Heba","lastName":"Khdr","id":"38666724600"},{"name":"Waqaas Munawar","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems (CES), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany"],"firstName":"Waqaas","lastName":"Munawar","id":"37545788700"},{"name":"Jian-Jia Chen","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, TU Dortmund University, Germany"],"firstName":"Jian-Jia","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280675200"},{"name":"Muhammad Shafique","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems (CES), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Shafique","id":"37408660000"},{"name":"Minming Li","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, TU Dortmund University, Germany"],"firstName":"Minming","lastName":"Li","id":"37085412760"},{"name":"J\u00f6rg Henkel","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems (CES), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00f6rg","lastName":"Henkel","id":"37277243700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-3051-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6971826","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":649},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6971826","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","Steady-state","Thermal conductivity","Vectors","Boosting","Temperature measurement","Multicore processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","integrated circuit manufacture","power aware computing","thermal management (packaging)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TSP","thermal safe power","many-core systems","dark silicon","efficient power budgeting","chip manufacturers","thermal design power","TDP","cooling solution","dynamic thermal management techniques","DTM","power constraint","performance losses","power budgeting techniques","safe power constraint values","constant power budgets"]}],"abstract":"Chip manufacturers provide the Thermal Design Power (TDP) for a specific chip.

To avoid excessive triggers of DTM, usually, system designers also use TDP as power constraint. However, using a single and constant value as power constraint, e.g., TDP, can result in big performance losses in many-core systems. Having better power budgeting techniques is a major step towards dealing with the dark silicon problem. This paper presents a new power budget concept, called Thermal Safe Power (TSP), which is an abstraction that provides safe power constraint values as a function of the number of simultaneously operating cores. Executing cores at any power consumption below TSP ensures that DTM is not triggered. TSP can be computed offline for the worst cases, or online for a particular mapping of cores. Our simulations show that using TSP as power constraint results in 50.5% and 14.2% higher average performance, compared to using constant power budgets (both per-chip and per-core) and a boosting technique, respectively. Moreover, TSP results in dark silicon estimations which are more optimistic than estimations using constant power budgets.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6971816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2656075.2656103","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963814/6971816/06971826.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doi":"10.1145/2656075.2656103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TSP: Thermal Safe Power - Efficient power budgeting for many-core systems in dark silicon","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"TSP: Thermal Safe Power - Efficient power budgeting for many-core systems in dark silicon","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-17 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6971826/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14791653","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971826/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TSP: Thermal Safe Power - Efficient power budgeting for many-core systems in dark silicon","confLoc":"Uttar Pradesh, India","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"CODESISSS2B1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121325S","chronDate":"12-17 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963814","isNumber":"6971816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963814","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6971816","articleId":"6971826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":6971827,"authors":[{"name":"Hrishikesh Jayakumar","affiliation":["Purdue University System, West Lafayette, IN, US"],"firstName":"Hrishikesh","lastName":"Jayakumar"},{"name":"Arnab Raha","affiliation":["Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Arnab","lastName":"Raha","id":"38232267200"},{"name":"Vijay Raghunathan","affiliation":["Purdue University System, West Lafayette, IN, US"],"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Raghunathan"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-3051-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6971827","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":526},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microcontrollers","Registers","Phasor measurement units","Power demand","Switches","SRAM cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["checkpointing","embedded systems","microcontrollers","power aware computing","power consumption","SRAM chips","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HYPNOS","ultralow power sleep mode","SRAM data retention","embedded microcontrollers","heavily duty-cycled embedded system","energy consumption","battery lifetime","checkpointing","Flash","energy overhead","time overhead","onchip SRAM","microcontroller operating voltage","extreme voltage scaling","TI MSP430G2452 microcontroller","MCU","SRAM content preservation","wireless sensing system","battery capacity","power consumption","energy harvesting"]}],"abstract":"In heavily duty-cycled embedded systems, the energy consumed by the microcontroller in idle mode is often the bottleneck for battery lifetime. Existing solutions address this problem by placing the microcontroller in a low power (sleep) state when idle, and preserving application state either by retaining the data in-situ in SRAM, or by checkpointing it to FLASH. However, both these approaches have notable drawbacks. In-situ data retention requires the SRAM to remain powered in sleep mode, while checkpointing to FLASH involves significant energy and time overheads. This paper proposes a new ultra-low power sleep mode for micro-controllers that overcomes the limitations of both these ap- proaches. Our technique, HYPNOS, is based on the key observation that the on-chip SRAM in a microcontroller exhibits 100% data retention even at a much lower supply voltage (as much as 10x lower) than the typical operating voltage of the microcontroller. HYPNOS exploits this observation by performing extreme voltage scaling when the microcontroller is in sleep mode. We implement and evaluate HYPNOS for the TI MSP430G2452 microcontroller and show that the MCU draws only 26nA in the proposed sleep mode, which is 4\u00d7 lower than any existing sleep mode that preserves SRAM contents. Further, we show that a complete wireless sensing system using HYPNOS only depletes battery capacity by 42.6nAh in an hour. By decreasing the average power consumption to such minuscule levels, HYPNOS takes a significant step forward in making perpetual systems a reality through the use of energy harvesting.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hypnos: An ultra-low power sleep mode with SRAM data retention for embedded microcontrollers!","doi":"10.1145/2656075.2656089","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2656075.2656089","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6971816","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963814/6971816/06971827.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6971827","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Hypnos: An ultra-low power sleep mode with SRAM data retention for embedded microcontrollers!","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6971827/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14791661","conferenceDate":"12-17 Oct. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hypnos: An ultra-low power sleep mode with SRAM data retention for embedded microcontrollers!","confLoc":"Uttar Pradesh, India","sourcePdf":"CODESISSS2B2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071682S","chronDate":"12-17 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963814","isNumber":"6971816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963814","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6971816","articleId":"6971827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6971829,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Shafique","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems (CES), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Shafique","id":"37408660000"},{"name":"Siddharth Garg","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems (CES), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Siddharth","lastName":"Garg","id":"37289176300"},{"name":"Tulika Mitra","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Tulika","lastName":"Mitra","id":"37282510200"},{"name":"Sri Parameswaran","affiliation":["University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, AU"],"firstName":"Sri","lastName":"Parameswaran"},{"name":"J\u00f6rg Henkel","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems (CES), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00f6rg","lastName":"Henkel","id":"37084153500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-3051-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6971829","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":342},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Program processors","Reliability","Computer architecture","Switches","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware-software codesign","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware-software co-design","on-chip resources","power budget","safe thermal limits","transistors","heterogeneous computing","performance improvement","energy efficiency improvement","reliability improvement","power constraint","thermal constraint","automated synthesis","design space exploration","run-time management","heterogeneous dark silicon processors"]}],"abstract":"Dark Silicon refers to the observation that in future technology nodes, it may only be possible to power-on a fraction of on-chip resources (processing cores, hardware accelerators, cache blocks and so on) in order to stay within the power budget and safe thermal limits, while the other resources will have to be kept powered-off or \u201cdark\u201d. In other words, chips will have an abundance of transistors, i.e., more than the number that can be simultaneously powered-on. Heterogeneous computing has been proposed as one way to effectively leverage this abundance of transistors in order to increase performance, energy efficiency and even reliability within power and thermal constraints. However, several critical challenges remain to be addressed including design, automated synthesis, design space exploration and run-time management of heterogeneous dark silicon processors. The hardware/software co-design and synthesis community has potentially much to contribute in solving these new challenges introduced by dark silicon and, in particular, heterogeneous computing.

Especially, in the domain of image processing on mobile devices, among numerous design challenges, a very stringent energy budget is of utmost importance, making embedded GPUs and FPGAs ideal targets for implementation. Recently, the HIPA\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">cc</sup>\n framework was proposed as a means for automatic code generation of image processing algorithms for embedded GPUs, based on a Domain-Specific Language (DSL).

As a remedy, in this work, we propose code generation techniques for C-based HLS from a common high-level DSL description targeting FPGAs. Our approach includes FPGA-specific memory architectures for handling point and local operators, numerous high-level transformations, and automatic test bench generation. We evaluate our approach by comparing the resulting hardware accelerators to existing frameworks in terms of performance and resource requirements.

These features include low power, high density, and better scalability. However, there are also two drawbacks in MLC PCM, namely, limited write endurance and expensive write operation, that need to be overcome in order to practically adopt MLC PCM as main memory. In MLC PCM, two different types of write operations with very diverse data retention time are allowed. The first type maintains data for years, but takes longer time to write and hurts the endurance. The second type maintains data for a short period, but takes shorter time to write and hurts the endurance less. By observing that many data written to main memory are temporary and do not need to last long during the execution of a program, in this paper, we propose novel task scheduling and write operation selection algorithms to improve MLC PCM endurance and program efficiency. An Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation is first proposed to obtain optimal results. Since ILP takes exponential time to solve, we also propose a Multi-Write Mode Aware Scheduling (MMAS) heuristic to achieve near-optimal solution in polynomial time. The experimental results show that the proposed techniques can greatly improve the lifetime of MLC PCM as well as the efficiency of the program.","doi":"10.1145/2656075.2656076","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963814/6971816/06971849.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6971816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2656075.2656076","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6971849","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3M-PCM: Exploiting multiple write modes MLC phase change main memory in embedded systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971849/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"3M-PCM: Exploiting multiple write modes MLC phase change main memory in embedded systems","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14806002","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","conferenceDate":"12-17 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6971849/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3M-PCM: Exploiting multiple write modes MLC phase change main memory in embedded systems","confLoc":"Uttar Pradesh, India","sourcePdf":"CODESISSS8B1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.172099S","chronDate":"12-17 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963814","isNumber":"6971816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963814","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6971816","articleId":"6971849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6971913,"authors":[{"name":"Ilkyu Kim","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/74/6971862/6971913/6971913-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ilkyu Kim obtained the BSc in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Hong-ik University, Seoul, Korea in 2003; the MSc in Electrical Engineering from University of Southern California in 2006; and the PhD from University of California at Los Angeles in 2012.

In order to address this issue, the fundamentals of the septum operation are first revisited, using a graphical visualization through full-wave analysis. A septum profiled with smooth edges is next presented, with enhanced power-handling capabilities in comparison to the stepped-septum polarizer. In this work, the sigmoid function is introduced to represent the smooth contour of the septum, and to enable diverse configurations without any discontinuities. The smooth and stepped profiles are optimized using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique. The maximum electric-field intensity around the smooth edges is investigated using a full-wave simulator, HFSS. Our observations show that the maximum electric field is reduced by 40% in comparison to the stepped septum. In Appendix 1, the numerical approach is evaluated by comparing the exact series solution for the half-plane scattering problem with the simulated results in HFSS. In Appendix 2, a septum design with rounded edges is also studied as another possible design to reduce the maximum fields.","doi":"10.1109/MAP.2014.6971913","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/74/6971862/06971913.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAP.2014.6971913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6971862","startPage":"16","endPage":"42","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing the Power Capabilities of the Stepped Septum Using an Optimized Smooth Sigmoid Profile","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6971913","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing the Power Capabilities of the Stepped Septum Using an Optimized Smooth Sigmoid Profile","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6971913/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14788761","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6971913/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing the Power Capabilities of the Stepped Septum Using an Optimized Smooth Sigmoid Profile","sourcePdf":"AP1642Kovitz.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077688S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"6971862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6971862","articleId":"6971913","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6971919,"authors":[{"name":"Gonca \u00c7akir","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering Department, Kocaeli University, Umuttepe, Kocaeli, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/74/6971862/6971919/6971919-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gonca \u00c7akir received the BSEE, MSEE, and PhD in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the Engineering Faculty of Kocaeli University (KOU) in 1996, 1999, and 2004, respectively.

This work presents an improved version of an algorithm suitable to compute the 2-D discrete wavelet transform on GPU. Depending on the GPU platform, it is suitable to split the 2-D transform computation into separated horizontal and vertical passes. Considering the horizontal passes, we have examined and chosen the best performing method among the already known ones. Furthermore, we have adapted this method for an existing algorithm computing the vertical transform pass. This step helps to reduce several synchronizations and arithmetic operations in the utilized computation scheme. For large data, the proposed vertical method achieves speed-up about 30% compared to the current state of the art methods. In contrast to previously published works, the presented approach is built on the OpenCL parallel programming framework.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968678/6971993/06972006.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2014 International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing Workshop","doi":"10.1109/SBAC-PADW.2014.13","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBAC-PADW.2014.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6971993","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6972006","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2-D Discrete Wavelet Transform Using GPU","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Instruction sets","Graphics processing units","Discrete wavelet transforms","Strips","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","discrete wavelet transforms","graphics processing units","mathematics computing","parallel programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D discrete wavelet transform","GPU","horizontal passes","vertical passes","synchronization reduction","arithmetic operations","OpenCL parallel programming framework"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","image processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6972006/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"2-D Discrete Wavelet Transform Using GPU","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6972006/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14792618","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2-D Discrete Wavelet Transform Using GPU","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"7014a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053149S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968678","isNumber":"6971993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968678","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6971993","articleId":"6972006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6972014,"authors":[{"name":"Paulo Martins","affiliation":["SiPS, Universidade de Lisboa Rua Alves Redol, Portugal"],"firstName":"Paulo","lastName":"Martins","id":"37085464267"},{"name":"Leonel Sousa","affiliation":["SiPS, Universidade de Lisboa Rua Alves Redol, Portugal"],"firstName":"Leonel","lastName":"Sousa","id":"37265872100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7014-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6972014","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6972014","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Program processors","Parallel processing","Elliptic curve cryptography","Multicore processing","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessing systems","parallel processing","performance evaluation","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicore systems evaluation","SIMD engines","public-key cryptography","cryptographic applications","embedded devices","cryptographic accelerators","two-tiered parallelism model","single instruction multiple data","SIMD parallelism","parallel modular multiplications","Rivest-Shavir-Adleman cryptosystems","RSA cryptosystems","elliptic curve cryptosystems","EC cryptosystems","general purpose processors","ARM A15 quad-core processor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Public-Key Cryptography","Embedded Systems","Montgomery Multiplication","Parallel Algorithms"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SBAC-PADW.2014.10","publicationTitle":"2014 International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968678/6971993/06972014.pdf","startPage":"48","endPage":"53","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBAC-PADW.2014.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6971993","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Evaluation of Multi-core Systems with SIMD Engines for Public-Key Cryptography","abstract":"The acceleration of cryptographic applications on embedded devices is a topic of increasingly importance, due to their massive use.

In addition, the applicability of the developed parallel modular multiplications are tested for the Rivest-Shavir-Adleman (RSA) and Elliptic Curve (EC) cryptosystems. The relative efficiency of the two-tiered model for implementing cryptosystems on general purpose processors and embedded devices is analysed and experimentally evaluated.

Based on the optimum design for proportional plus resonant (P+R) controller, this paper introduces an active damping method based on the capacitor estimated current without increase in the number of sensors.

The main building blocks of DC power systems are switching power converters and rectifiers that have nonlinear characteristics. When the voltages are tightly regulated, the converters will act as constant power loads (CPLs). The CPL is known to exhibit the negative incremental impedance and may cause the dynamic instability of the system. The problem associated with CPLs is traditionally tackled using passive damping which has serious drawbacks such as increased size, decreased reliability and efficiency of the system. This paper introduces an active method to inject damping current into the power bus employing an auxiliary power circuit. The proposed approach ensures that the system operates with sufficient stability margin in a small-signal sense.

With the MIMOCs decomposed into three stages, namely, input stage, energy buffer stage, and output stage, a set of synthesis rules for MIMOCs are proposed. Consequently, two families of MIMOCs are generated, where the inductor and capacitor are employed as the central energy buffer elements, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/INTLEC.2014.6972210","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 36th International Telecommunications Energy Conference (INTELEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 36th International Telecommunications Energy Conference (INTELEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963753/6972109/06972210.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INTLEC.2014.6972210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6972109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A methodology to derive single-stage multiple-input multiple-output DC-DC converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6972210","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2014-Oct. 2 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6972210/","displayDocTitle":"A methodology to derive single-stage multiple-input multiple-output DC-DC converters","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14790975","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6972210/","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A methodology to derive single-stage multiple-input multiple-output DC-DC converters","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"INTELEC2014PO31.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116435S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2014-Oct. 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963753","isNumber":"6972109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963753","xplore-issue":"6972109","articleId":"6972210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6972215,"authors":[{"name":"Bernd Wunder","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institut IISB, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernd","lastName":"Wunder","id":"37085347400"},{"name":"Leopold Ott","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institut IISB, Germany"],"firstName":"Leopold","lastName":"Ott","id":"37085363411"},{"name":"Marek Szpek","affiliation":["Emerson Network Power, Sweden"],"firstName":"Marek","lastName":"Szpek","id":"37992841400"},{"name":"Ulrich Boeke","affiliation":["Philips Electronics Netherland B.V., Philips Research, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Ulrich","lastName":"Boeke","id":"37689801300"},{"name":"Roland Wei\u00df","affiliation":["Siemens AG, Munchen, Bayern, DE"],"firstName":"Roland","lastName":"Wei\u00df"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3104-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-0473"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-5210"}],"articleNumber":"6972215","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":646},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power cables","Switches","Power electronics","Rectifiers","Electromagnetic interference","Light emitting diodes","Buildings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buildings (structures)","distribution networks","energy conservation","invertors","lighting","photovoltaic power systems","power electronics","power grids","telecommunication equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficiency","commercial buildings","power electronics","electric applications","lighting","IT equipment","telecommunication equipment","speed-controlled drives","heating applications","cooling applications","ventilation applications","AC grid","European ENIAC R&D project consortium","DC grid components","energy conversion","PV inverter conversion","Fraunhofer Institute","Erlangen","Germany","DC grid system","voltage 380 V"]}],"abstract":"Modern power electronics enable the efficient supply of almost all kinds of electric applications in commercial buildings, e. g. lighting, IT- and telecommunication equipment, as well as speed-controlled drives in heating, cooling and ventilation applications.

In mobile cloud, mobile users can access and schedule the resources or services in remote clouds via wireless networks, which we call mobile cloud task scheduling. They even can build mobile micro-cloud (MuCloud) with mobile device to provide lightweight service. However, unreliable wireless connection and dynamic join and quit of MuCloud make task scheduling in mobile cloud face more challenges than in wired cloud. Moreover, from both the users and service providers' perspective, task scheduling is a multi-objective optimization problem. Small makespan and load balancing are pursued by mobile users and cloud service providers respectively. In this paper, we advance a demand-driven task scheduling model and introduce an estimate method to predict warranty complete time of tasks in wireless network. An improved genetic algorithm using 2D chromosome (2DCGA) is presented to tackle multi-objective task scheduling. Simulation experiments show: 1) compared with Markov model, our estimate method has higher accuracy of prediction and more reasonable prediction results of probability of task scheduling failure; 2) 2DCGA has good performance for task scheduling. When compared with IGA, it has smaller makespan and lower deviation of load; 3) objective priority can be adjusted exactly by weights of fitness functions. It makes 2DCGA suitable for multi-objective optimization.","doi":"10.1109/PIC.2014.6972393","pdfPath":"/iel7/6962986/6972283/06972393.pdf","startPage":"539","endPage":"545","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Progress in Informatics and Computing","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Progress in Informatics and Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIC.2014.6972393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6972283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Demand-driven task scheduling using 2D chromosome genetic algorithm in mobile cloud","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6972393/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 May 2014","displayDocTitle":"Demand-driven task scheduling using 2D chromosome genetic algorithm in mobile cloud","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14790801","publicationDate":"May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6972393/","conferenceDate":"16-18 May 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demand-driven task scheduling using 2D chromosome genetic algorithm in mobile cloud","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0116307.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049264S","chronDate":"16-18 May 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6962986","isNumber":"6972283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6962986","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6972283","articleId":"6972393","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6972395,"authors":[{"name":"Mian Lou","affiliation":["Research Center of SoC, Xi'an Microelectronics Technology Institute Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Mian","lastName":"Lou","id":"37085490018"},{"name":"Yuanyuan Cui","affiliation":["Research Center of SoC, Xi'an Microelectronics Technology Institute Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yuanyuan","lastName":"Cui","id":"37085489518"},{"name":"Ruxia Pei","affiliation":["Research Center of SoC, Xi'an Microelectronics Technology Institute Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Ruxia","lastName":"Pei","id":"37085488005"},{"name":"Xunying Zhang","affiliation":["Research Center of SoC, Xi'an Microelectronics Technology Institute Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xunying","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085483796"},{"name":"Longsheng Wu","affiliation":["Research Center of SoC, Xi'an Microelectronics Technology Institute Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Longsheng","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085490660"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2030-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2033-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2031-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6972395","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fault-tolerant SDRAM controller based on a dynamically reconfigurable shift register chain","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Progress in Informatics and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6962986/6972283/06972395.pdf","startPage":"551","endPage":"555","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Progress in Informatics and Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIC.2014.6972395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6972283","doi":"10.1109/PIC.2014.6972395","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["SDRAM","Decoding","Shift registers","Delays","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","DRAM chips","error correction codes","fault tolerance","Hamming codes","radiation hardening (electronics)","shift registers","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault-tolerant SDRAM controller","dynamically reconfigurable shift register chain","single event upsets","SEUs","single-bit error","optimized encoder","decoder","(40, 32) Hamming code","error correction","write request shift register chain","subsequence write request prefetching","data correction shift register chain","burst read data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SDRAM controller","fault-tolerant","Hamming code","shift register chain"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6972395","abstract":"A SDRAM like conventional memories can be affected by the occurrence of single event upsets (SEUs) which can lead to serious faults such as single-bit error. In order to cope with this effect of SEUs, a fault-tolerant SDRAM controller is proposed instead of previous approaches that required modifications to the internal structure of the SDRAM itself. For one thing, an optimized encoder and decoder based the (40, 32) Hamming code are integrated to eliminate the problem of single-bit error. Moreover, in the context of error correction, a write request shift register chain is adopted to prefetch the subsequence write requests, and simultaneously a data correction shift register chain is applied to hide the delay of write-back into the following accesses. Besides, with the dynamic combination of two chains, a reconfigurable new chain can be generated to achieve the goal that the burst read data, corrected data and requested write data can be issued seamlessly. Simulation results show that, the optimized encoder and decoder reduce 16.45% area overhead with the slight delay, and the proposed structure could also reduce 11.2% execution time of the test program.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6972395/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14790796","htmlLink":"/document/6972395/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","conferenceDate":"16-18 May 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A fault-tolerant SDRAM controller based on a dynamically reconfigurable shift register chain","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fault-tolerant SDRAM controller based on a dynamically reconfigurable shift register chain","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0118313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090189S","chronDate":"16-18 May 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6962986","isNumber":"6972283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6962986","xplore-issue":"6972283","articleId":"6972395","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6972397,"authors":[{"name":"Hanlin Fang","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Laboratory of Emergency Communication, Chongqing Communication Institute, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Hanlin","lastName":"Fang","id":"37085402417"},{"name":"Lijia Ge","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Laboratory of Emergency Communication, Chongqing Communication Institute, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Lijia","lastName":"Ge","id":"37085416585"},{"name":"Guoqing Zhu","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Laboratory of Emergency Communication, Chongqing Communication Institute, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Guoqing","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085404345"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2030-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2033-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2031-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6972397","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Complexity theory","Antennas","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Measurement","MIMO","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal detection","error statistics","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radius adaptive K-best algorithm","RAKB algorithm","MIMO system","BER performance","SQRD method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","detection","algorithm","performance and complexity"]}],"abstract":"The K-Best algorithm can achieve high BER performance with a large K value, but the complexity is very high.

Even though the additional flexibility of a programmable core comes at the expense of reduced area- and energy efficiency, this price is potentially worth paying in application domains with a multitude of standards and use cases as it is the case in the domain of wireless communications. The high dynamic range of values that occurs in multi-antenna wireless baseband processing calls for the use of numerical stabilization measures like QR factorization and scaling when operating on a fixed-point processor core. A floating-point core on the other hand covers a wider dynamic range, rendering such measures unnecessary at the price of increased power consumption. This work compares a floating-point and a fixed-point SIMD core in a case study of linear MIMO detection. After evaluating the numerical precision requirements, the achievable throughput of both cores is compared along with the maximum achievable area- and energy efficiency for several use cases, resulting in an assessment as to which number format is best suited for which use case.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Symposium on System-on-Chip (SoC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6961602/6972425/06972429.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2014 International Symposium on System-on-Chip (SoC)","doi":"10.1109/ISSOC.2014.6972429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSOC.2014.6972429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6972425","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6972429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficiency of floating-point and fixed-point SIMD cores for MIMO processing systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matrix decomposition","Vectors","Runtime","MIMO","Energy consumption","Pipelines","Adders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","energy conservation","MIMO communication","numerical analysis","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficiency","floating-point SIMD cores","fixed-point SIMD cores","MIMO processing systems","regular data access patterns","vector arithmetic","single instruction multiple data processor cores","SIMD processor cores","application-specific integrated circuits","ASIC","programmable core","wireless communications","high dynamic range","multiantenna wireless baseband processing calls","numerical stabilization measures","QR factorization","fixed-point processor core","floating-point core","rendering","power consumption","linear MIMO detection","numerical precision requirements"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6972429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficiency of floating-point and fixed-point SIMD cores for MIMO processing systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6972429/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14790580","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","conferenceDate":"28-29 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficiency of floating-point and fixed-point SIMD cores for MIMO processing systems","confLoc":"Tampere, Finland","sourcePdf":"002EnergyefficiencyGuenther3402435.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052568S","chronDate":"28-29 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6961602","isNumber":"6972425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6961602","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6972425","articleId":"6972429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6972434,"authors":[{"name":"Janne Virtanen","affiliation":["Department of Pervasive Computing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Janne","lastName":"Virtanen","id":"37085426352"},{"name":"Lauri Matilainen","affiliation":["Department of Pervasive Computing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Lauri","lastName":"Matilainen","id":"37888869800"},{"name":"Erno Salminen","affiliation":["Department of Pervasive Computing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Erno","lastName":"Salminen","id":"37298852100"},{"name":"Timo D.

The main motivation for the implementation is instability of other publicly available implementations. The developed implementation utilizes POSIX message queues, that is an easily portable interface and readily compatible with MCAPI. The performance was measured as latency and transfer rate of the API. The measurement platforms were a x86-64 PC and a development board featuring an ARM processor. A MCAPI implementation was used as reference for comparison. PMQ-MCAPI is much more stable and easily usable than other MCAPI implementations publicly available for PC. When transfer size was between 1-8 KiB, latency of transfers between cores was between 9-15 \u03bcs and transfer rate 500-5000 MBps. This translates to 27 000-45 000 cycles and 0.16-1.67 bytes per cycle. CPU and especially performance of its cache were concluded as the most important factors contributing to the performance. In comparison to the reference, latency of the implementation was 1/8 at best, while transfer rate was up to 35x.","doi":"10.1109/ISSOC.2014.6972434","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSOC.2014.6972434","publicationTitle":"2014 International Symposium on System-on-Chip (SoC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Symposium on System-on-Chip (SoC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6961602/6972425/06972434.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6972425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of Multicore communications API","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6972434/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Oct. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Implementation of Multicore communications API","conferenceDate":"28-29 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14790577","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6972434/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of Multicore communications API","confLoc":"Tampere, Finland","sourcePdf":"014ImplementationofVirtanen3401937.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049853S","chronDate":"28-29 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6961602","isNumber":"6972425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6961602","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6972425","articleId":"6972434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6972443,"authors":[{"name":"Alex Schoenberger","affiliation":["TU Darmstadt, Integrated Electronic Systems Lab, Germany"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Schoenberger","id":"37085542502"},{"name":"Klaus Hofmann","affiliation":["TU Darmstadt, Integrated Electronic Systems Lab, Germany"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Hofmann","id":"37375118300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6890-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6972443","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Memory Region: 3D DRAM memory concept evaluated for JPEG2000 algorithm","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Symposium on System-on-Chip (SoC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6961602/6972425/06972443.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2014 International Symposium on System-on-Chip (SoC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSOC.2014.6972443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6972425","doi":"10.1109/ISSOC.2014.6972443","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Adaptation models","Lead","Plasmas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","DRAM chips","integrated circuit interconnections","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast memory region","3D DRAM memory","JPEG2000 algorithm","3D stacking technology","connection impedance","wide interface","flexible interface","DRAM layers","locality principle","encoder procedure execution"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6972443","abstract":"3D stacking technology provides defined connection impedance and wide and flexible interface.

Furthermore, a new dynamic branch metric saturation scheme is presented in order to optimize the hardware utilization by proper adjusting the correlated upper state and branch metric bounds.

Transport Triggered Architecture (TTA) is a VLIW variant whose exposed datapath reduces the need for RF accesses and ports. However, the comparative advantage of TTAs suffers in practice from a wide instruction word and complex interconnection network (IC). We argue that these issues are at least partly due to suboptimal design choices. The design space of possible TTA architectures is very large, and previous automated and ad-hoc design methods often produce inefficient architectures. We propose a reduced design space where efficient TTAs can be generated in a short time using excecution trace-driven greedy exploration. The proposed approach is evaluated by optimizing the equivalent of a 4-issue VLIW architecture. The algorithm finishes quickly and produces a processor with 10% reduced core energy product compared to a fully-connected TTA. Since the generated processor has low IC power and a shorter instruction word than a typical 4-issue VLIW, the results support the hypothesis that these drawbacks of TTA can be worked around with efficient IC design.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuits","Radio frequency","Ports (Computers)","VLIW","Program processors","Computer architecture","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["greedy algorithms","instruction sets","multiprocessor interconnection networks","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["greedy transport triggered architecture interconnect exploration","power dissipation","very large instruction word processors","heuristics","VLIW processors","large multiport register files","TTA","datapath","RF accesses","ports","complex interconnection network","design space","ad-hoc design methods","automated design methods","excecution trace-driven greedy exploration","reduced core energy product","IC power","IC design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["TTA","VLIW","design space exploration","port sharing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6972455","doi":"10.1145/2656106.2656123","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Compilers, Architecture and Synthesis for Embedded Systems (CASES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963812/6972453/06972455.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2656106.2656123","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6972453","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Compilers, Architecture and Synthesis for Embedded Systems (CASES)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heuristics for greedy transport triggered architecture interconnect exploration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Heuristics for greedy transport triggered architecture interconnect exploration","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6972455/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Oct. 2014","conferenceDate":"12-17 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6972455/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14840944","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heuristics for greedy transport triggered architecture interconnect exploration","confLoc":"Uttar Pradesh, India","sourcePdf":"CASES12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085125S","chronDate":"12-17 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963812","isNumber":"6972453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963812","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6972453","articleId":"6972455","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6972456,"authors":[{"name":"Ryan Kim","affiliation":["Washington State University, Pullman, WA, US"],"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Kim"},{"name":"Guangshuo Liu","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, US"],"firstName":"Guangshuo","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Paul Wettin","affiliation":["Washington State University, Pullman, WA, US"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Wettin"},{"name":"Radu Marculescu","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, US"],"firstName":"Radu","lastName":"Marculescu"},{"name":"Diana Marculescu","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, US"],"firstName":"Diana","lastName":"Marculescu"},{"name":"Partha Pratim Pande","affiliation":["Washington State University, Pullman, WA, US"],"firstName":"Partha Pratim","lastName":"Pande"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-3050-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6972456","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":223},"abstract":"In recent years, multiple Voltage Frequency Island (VFI)-based designs have increasingly made their way into both commercial and research multicore platforms.

It becomes therefore possible to exploit the small-world effects induced by the wireless links of a WiNoC to achieve efficient inter-VFI data exchanges. In this work, we demonstrate that WiNoCs can provide better latency and energy profiles compared to traditional mesh-like architecture for VFI-partitioned multicore designs. The performance gains and energy efficiency are achieved due to the low-power wireless shortcuts in conjunction with the small-world architecture.

However, the adoption of flow-based biochips is hampered today by the lack of computer-aided design tools. Manual design procedures not only delay product development but they also inhibit the exploitation of the design complexity that is possible with current fabrication techniques. In this paper, we present the first practical problem formulation for automated control-layer design in flow-based microfluidic VLSI (mVLSI) biochips and propose a systematic approach for solving this problem. Our goal is to find an efficient routing solution for control-layer design with a minimum number of control pins. The pressure-propagation delay, an intrinsic physical phenomenon in mVLSI biochips, is minimized in order to reduce the response time for valves, decrease the pattern set-up time, and synchronize valve actuation. Two fabricated flow-based devices and five synthetic benchmarks are used to evaluate the proposed optimization method.

With shrinking device sizes, the total circuit sensitivity to both permanent and transient faults has increased significantly. Research for fault tolerant processors has primarily focused on the conventional processor architectures. Neural network computing has been employed to solve a wide range of problems. This paper presents a design and implementation of a physical neural network that is resilient to permanent hardware faults. To achieve scalability, it uses tiled neuron clusters where neuron outputs are efficiently forwarded to the target neurons using source based spanning tree routing. To achieve fault resilience in the face of increasing number of permanent hardware failures, the design proactively preserves neural network computing performance by selectively replicating performance critical neurons. Furthermore, the paper presents a spanning tree recovery solution that mitigates disruption to distribution of neuron outputs caused by failed neuron clusters. The proposed neuron cluster design is implemented in Verilog. We studied the fault resilience performance of the described design using a RBM neural network trained for classifying handwritten digit images. Results demonstrate that our approach can achieve improved fault resilience performance by replicating only 5% most important neurons.","doi":"10.1145/2656106.2656126","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Compilers, Architecture and Synthesis for Embedded Systems (CASES)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2656106.2656126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6972453","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Compilers, Architecture and Synthesis for Embedded Systems (CASES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963812/6972453/06972477.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault resilient physical neural networks on a single chip","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6972477/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fault resilient physical neural networks on a single chip","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6972477/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14840945","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2015","conferenceDate":"12-17 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Oct. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault resilient physical neural networks on a single chip","confLoc":"Uttar Pradesh, India","sourcePdf":"CASES83.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107479S","chronDate":"12-17 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963812","isNumber":"6972453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963812","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6972453","articleId":"6972477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6972481,"authors":[{"name":"Bartosz Wojciechowski","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Engineering Control and Robotics, Wroclaw University of Technology, Wroclaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Bartosz","lastName":"Wojciechowski","id":"37858411900"},{"name":"Maciej Nikodem","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Engineering Control and Robotics, Wroclaw University of Technology, Wroclaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Maciej","lastName":"Nikodem","id":"37282094700"},{"name":"Pawe\u0142 Weber","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Engineering Control and Robotics, Wroclaw University of Technology, Wroclaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Pawe\u0142","lastName":"Weber","id":"37085506376"},{"name":"Maciej Zagrabski","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Engineering Control and Robotics, Wroclaw University of Technology, Wroclaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Maciej","lastName":"Zagrabski","id":"37085512350"},{"name":"Krzysztof K\u0119pa","affiliation":["Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Krzysztof","lastName":"K\u0119pa","id":"37320847500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5415-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6972481","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware microprocessor thermal emulation using synthetic heat sources and temperature sensors in FPGA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6972481","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heating","Temperature sensors","Microprocessors","Temperature measurement","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooling","electronics packaging","field programmable gate arrays","microprocessor chips","oscillators","temperature sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware microprocessor thermal emulation","synthetic heat sources","temperature sensors","FPGA","artificial heat sources","controllable heaters","artificially high power dissipation","architecture-level simulator","embedded thermal sensors","ring oscillators","multi-core microprocessor systems","cooling packages","thermal coupling"]}],"abstract":"This work presents an early evaluation of FPGA-based hardware thermal emulation methodology based on artificial heat sources and temperature sensors that can be used in real-time thermal simulation infrastructure.

The BCI CTM enables a division of responsibilities: the component manufacturer models the inside of the package and the world outside the package is the domain of the thermal application engineer. The present work relates to the thermal behaviour of a multi heat source component under unequal thermal loading and with or without the presence of an external heat sink. It is shown that the external heat sink not only improves the overall thermal resistance from the component to the ambient, but also impacts the elements in the thermal impedance matrix that are usually associated with heat transfer inside the package by providing a parallel path for lateral conduction. The latter effect has implications for the boundary condition independent characterization of multi-heat source components.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heat sinks","Heat transfer","Load modeling","Resistance heating","Electronic packaging thermal management","Thermal loading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric impedance","heat conduction","heat sinks","printed circuit manufacture","thermal management (packaging)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal characterization","multiheat source component","external heat sink","electronics components","boundary condition","independent compact thermal model","BCI CTM","component manufacturer","thermal application engineer","unequal thermal loading","thermal impedance matrix","heat transfer","lateral conduction"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6972478","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THERMINIC.2014.6972492","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"20th International Workshop on Thermal Investigations of ICs and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"20th International Workshop on Thermal Investigations of ICs and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966886/6972478/06972492.pdf","doi":"10.1109/THERMINIC.2014.6972492","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal characterization of a multi-heat source component with and without an external heat sink","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Thermal characterization of a multi-heat source component with and without an external heat sink","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14792304","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6972492/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6972492/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal characterization of a multi-heat source component with and without an external heat sink","confLoc":"Greenwich, UK","sourcePdf":"141013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071443S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966886","isNumber":"6972478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966886","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6972478","articleId":"6972492","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6972500,"authors":[{"name":"Zipeng Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Zipeng","lastName":"Li","id":"37085374743"},{"name":"Tsung-Yi Ho","affiliation":["Computer Science and Information Engineering Department, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsung-Yi","lastName":"Ho","id":"37398757000"},{"name":"Krishnendu Chakrabarty","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Krishnendu","lastName":"Chakrabarty","id":"37084986500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5415-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6972500","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":292},"abstract":"A digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) is an attractive technology platform for revolutionizing immunoassays, clinical diagnostics, drug discovery, DNA sequencing, and other laboratory procedures in biochemistry. In most of these applications, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an indispensable step for amplifying specific DNA segments. Compared with traditional PCR platforms, DMFBs offer the benefits of smaller size, higher sensitivity and quicker time-to-results. Heater design is critical for any on-chip PCR implementation because it is closely related to each step of the PCR. In this paper, we propose a combined electrode/heater structure that can realize the functions of both heating and electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) actuation, and we systematically analyze and compare this heater design to the conventional square-shaped heater. The heating efficiency and thermal response of both the proposed and conventional heater structure are studied through detailed COMSOL Multiphysics simulations. Based on our heater design, a corresponding self-adaptive heating system is also proposed for precise temperature control.","displayPublicationTitle":"20th International Workshop on Thermal Investigations of ICs and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966886/6972478/06972500.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"20th International Workshop on Thermal Investigations of ICs and Systems","doi":"10.1109/THERMINIC.2014.6972500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THERMINIC.2014.6972500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6972478","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6972500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of heaters in a digital microfluidic biochip for the polymerase chain reaction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heating","Temperature distribution","Electrodes","DNA","Microfluidics","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biochemistry","bioMEMS","lab-on-a-chip","microfluidics","temperature control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital microfluidic biochip","polymerase chain reaction","heater optimisation","attractive technology platform","immunoassays","clinical diagnostics","drug discovery","DNA sequencing","biochemistry","specific DNA segments","on-chip PCR implementation","electrode/heater structure","electrowetting-on-dielectric","heating efficiency","thermal response","precise temperature control","self-adaptive heating system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6972500/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of heaters in a digital microfluidic biochip for the polymerase chain reaction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6972500/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14792274","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of heaters in a digital microfluidic biochip for the polymerase chain reaction","confLoc":"Greenwich, UK","sourcePdf":"421012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.127683S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966886","isNumber":"6972478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966886","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6972478","articleId":"6972500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6972506,"authors":[{"name":"Pawel Weber","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Engineering, Control and Robotics, Wroclaw University of Technology, Wroclaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Pawel","lastName":"Weber","id":"37085593515"},{"name":"Maciej Zagrabski","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Engineering, Control and Robotics, Wroclaw University of Technology, Wroclaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Maciej","lastName":"Zagrabski","id":"37085512350"},{"name":"Przemys\u0142aw Musz","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Engineering, Control and Robotics, Wroclaw University of Technology, Wroclaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Przemys\u0142aw","lastName":"Musz","id":"37085589245"},{"name":"Krzysztof K\u0119pa","affiliation":["Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, US"],"firstName":"Krzysztof","lastName":"K\u0119pa"},{"name":"Maciej Nikodem","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Engineering, Control and Robotics, Wroclaw University of Technology, Wroclaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Maciej","lastName":"Nikodem","id":"37282094700"},{"name":"Bartosz Wojciechowski","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Engineering, Control and Robotics, Wroclaw University of Technology, Wroclaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Bartosz","lastName":"Wojciechowski","id":"37858411900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5415-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6972506","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heating","Temperature measurement","Field programmable gate arrays","Power measurement","Temperature sensors","Generators","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","power consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["configurable heat generators","FPGA fabric","high-performance synthetic heat generators","design flow","vendor tools","synchronous heaters","asynchronous heaters","efficacy","dynamic range","temperature measurements","power measurements","Virtex5 FPGA","power consumption","power dissipation"]}],"abstract":"This work describes methodology for implementation of high-performance synthetic heat generators within the FPGA fabric.

Under natural air cooling, the leakage current increases exponentially by 1.9 X as the temperature increases from 26.3 \u00b0C to 57.6 \u00b0C. 18.8 \u00b0C temperature drop and 66.2% leakage current saving is achieved by microfluidic cooling compared to natural air cooling at heatflux 34.5 W/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n. In addition, the time to reach a steady state in response to a sudden application of microfluidic cooling is only 48.5% of that of forced air cooling. Lastly, increasing the flow rate of microfluidic cooling does not decrease the temperature and leakage current much.","publicationTitle":"20th International Workshop on Thermal Investigations of ICs and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"20th International Workshop on Thermal Investigations of ICs and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966886/6972478/06972541.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THERMINIC.2014.6972541","doi":"10.1109/THERMINIC.2014.6972541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6972478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancement in CMOS chip performance through microfluidic cooling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enhancement in CMOS chip performance through microfluidic cooling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6972541/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6972541/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14792276","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancement in CMOS chip performance through microfluidic cooling","confLoc":"Greenwich, UK","sourcePdf":"1046keynote.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074104S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966886","isNumber":"6972478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966886","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6972478","articleId":"6972541","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6972558,"authors":[{"name":"Xinkai Yan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Mathematical Engineering and Advanced Computing, Wuxi, China"],"firstName":"Xinkai","lastName":"Yan","id":"37085532320"},{"name":"Guiming Wu","affiliation":["State Key Lab. of Math.

In order to design a high-performance modular multiplier, we present a novel hybrid Montgomery modular multiplier over GF(p) on FPGAs, which employs Karatsuba and Knuth multiplication algorithms in different levels to implement large integer multiplication. A 9-stage pipeline full-word multiplier is proposed for the 256-bit multiplication with 4-level recursion. The performance of our modular multiplier is improved through optimizing the pipeline and reducing carry-chain latency of the modular adder. On average, our modular multiplier can perform one 256-bit modular multiplication in 3 cycles. We can integrate 13 modular multipliers on a Xilinx Virtex-6 V6VSX475T FPGA. The experimental results show that the throughput of 856.9 million modular multiplications per second can be achieved and the hybrid Montgomery modular multiplier has an outstanding performance in the situations which need continuous multiplications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6972558/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-8 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14806155","htmlLink":"/document/6972558/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Implementation of Montgomery Modular Multiplication on FPGAs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Implementation of Montgomery Modular Multiplication on FPGAs","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"4967a032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061981S","chronDate":"7-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6968711","isNumber":"6972544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968711","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6972544","articleId":"6972558","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6972563,"authors":[{"name":"Aihua Xiang","affiliation":["School of Software, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Aihua","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37085516598"},{"name":"Dong Wang","affiliation":["School of Software, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37279549400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4967-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-4968-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6972563","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6972563","abstract":"A mathematical model and a genetic algorithm are proposed to solve a logistics network optimization problem.

An optimized configuration must reduce as much as possible the volume of the superconducting material. In this paper is proposed an optimized solution of modular toroid coil geometry of SMES device using design of experiments (DOE) and finite element method (FEM). DOE is a rational realization of a series of real experiments a priori expensive and therefore it fits to the electromagnetic simulations (virtual experiments). Applied to the electrical systems modeled by FEM, it becomes a basic tool for optimization problems. Two geometric parameters characterizing the torus shape were chosen to determine the optimal configuration of the coil geometry of a SMES device for an optimized storage capacity. The ratio of maximum stored magnetic energy and the minimum volume of superconducting material was set as objective function. To solve it, the method of zooms without computation of models was used. The 2-D FEM implementation uses an equivalent rectangular cross section toroid, conserving the inductance of the system. The optimization results are obtained with less than 1% error. Comparison with previous numerical tests was made.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of modular toroid coil geometry of a superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage device using design of experiments and FEM","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Applied and Theoretical Electricity (ICATE)","doi":"10.1109/ICATE.2014.6972599","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Applied and Theoretical Electricity (ICATE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963791/6972582/06972599.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICATE.2014.6972599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6972582","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6972599","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6972599/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of modular toroid coil geometry of a superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage device using design of experiments and FEM","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6972599/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14791591","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of modular toroid coil geometry of a superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage device using design of experiments and FEM","confLoc":"Craiova, Romania","sourcePdf":"0204.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054665S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963791","isNumber":"6972582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963791","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6972582","articleId":"6972599","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6972630,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolae Dig\u0103","affiliation":["Doctoral School of Electrical Engineering, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Nicolae","lastName":"Dig\u0103","id":"37074157000"},{"name":"Constantin Ghit\u0103","affiliation":["Doctoral School of Electrical Engineering, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Constantin","lastName":"Ghit\u0103","id":"38252146400"},{"name":"Daniela Popescu","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Craiova, Craiova, Romania"],"firstName":"Daniela","lastName":"Popescu","id":"37546152200"},{"name":"Silvia-Maria Dig\u0103","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Craiova, Craiova, Romania"],"firstName":"Silvia-Maria","lastName":"Dig\u0103","id":"37595663200"},{"name":"Maria Brojboiu","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Craiova, Craiova, Romania"],"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Brojboiu","id":"37442423300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4161-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6972630","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Permanent magnet motors","Stators","Synchronous motors","Solid modeling","Torque","Finite element analysis","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bicycles","CAD/CAM","computer aided engineering","electromagnetic fields","finite element analysis","optimisation","permanent magnet motors","synchronous motor drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["functional-constructive optimization","electromagnetic low frequency ANSYS","electromagnetic field","CAE","CAM","CAD","advanced licensed software","bicycle drive","finite element method software package","low speed permanent magnet synchronous motor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Brushless drive","Device modelling","Modelling","Permanent magnet motor","Simulation","Software","Synchronous motor"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the authors present the analysis by Finite Element Method software packages of optimization of a permanent magnet synchronous motor with low speed, used to drive a bicycle.

The MQ is used to generate concentration gradients of the chemokine Interleukin-8 atop human neutrophils cultured in petri-dishes. The gradients are generated within the MQ in the gap between the microfluidic probe and the neutrophil-containing dish. We studied travelled distances and migration speeds of individual neutrophils using real time-lapse microscopy and observed heterogeneity with neutrophils dynamics. Results show that the migration distance of individual neutrophils is correlated to their initial position within the gradients. Interestingly, analysis revealed that neutrophils started migration with full speed at the beginning of the experiment when exposed to the gradients, and then slow down as they migrate toward higher concentrations until they stop, suggesting a desensitization mechanism that is gradually activated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neutrophil dynamics during migration in microfluidic concentration gradients","publicationTitle":"2014 40th Annual Northeast Bioengineering Conference (NEBEC)","doi":"10.1109/NEBEC.2014.6972913","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 40th Annual Northeast Bioengineering Conference (NEBEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6954316/6972691/06972913.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEBEC.2014.6972913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6972691","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6972913","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6972913/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 April 2014","displayDocTitle":"Neutrophil dynamics during migration in microfluidic concentration gradients","conferenceDate":"25-27 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6972913/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14789562","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neutrophil dynamics during migration in microfluidic concentration gradients","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"Qasaimeh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06381S","chronDate":"25-27 April 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6954316","isNumber":"6972691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6954316","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6972691","articleId":"6972913","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6972996,"authors":[{"name":"Haitian Zhai","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering","School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Haitian","lastName":"Zhai","id":"37085467997"},{"name":"Hui Li","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Li","id":"37085473263"},{"name":"Yicheng Bai","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering"],"firstName":"Yicheng","lastName":"Bai","id":"37085439331"},{"name":"Wenyan Jia","affiliation":["Departments of Neurosurgery"],"firstName":"Wenyan","lastName":"Jia","id":"37302902400"},{"name":"Mingui Sun","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering","Biocngmccring University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Mingui","lastName":"Sun","id":"37309412500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3728-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-6986"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-7028"}],"articleNumber":"6972996","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Visualization","Lenses","Feature extraction","Machine vision","Visual systems","Retina"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical optical imaging","body sensor networks","eye","image recognition","image resolution","medical image processing","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binocular vision system","wearable devices","binocular imaging system","camera system","smartphones","fish-eye lenses","output image resolution","computer vision tasks","target recognition","navigation","object tracking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["binocular vision","wearable device","fish-eye lens"]}],"abstract":"We present a novel binocular imaging system for wearable devices incorporating the biology knowledge of the human eyes.

The proposed bidirectional full-duplex transceiver IC contains a total of eight 28 Gb/s CDRs. Each CDR lane incorporates phase-rotator-based delay- and phase-locked loop (D/PLL) architecture for enhanced jitter filtering. All the CDR lanes operate independently while sharing a single voltage-controlled oscillator and supporting referenceless clock acquisition. To reduce power consumption, a multidrop clock distribution scheme with single on-chip transmission-line (T-line) and quadrate RX and TX schemes without CML logic gates are incorporated. Embedded built-in self-test modules featuring a random accumulation jitter generator enables bit error rate (BER) and jitter tolerance self tests without any external equipment. The TX featuring a three-tap pre-emphasis provides a variable output swing ranging from 478 mV\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ppd</sub>\n to 1.06 V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ppd</sub>\n.

However with the continuous scaling technology process, the chip yield and reliability of STT-MRAM face severe challenges due to the increasing permanent and transient faults. Due to the intrinsic fault features and the targeted application requirements of STT-MRAM, traditional fault tolerant design solutions, such as error correction code (ECC), redundancy repair (RR), and fault masking (FM) techniques, cannot be employed straightforwardly for STT-MRAM. In this paper, we propose a synergistic technique framework, named sECC, that integrates both the ECC and FM techniques to address simultaneously the permanent and transient faults. With such approach, permanent faults are masked while transient faults are corrected with the same codeword. Moreover taking into consideration the fact that most permanent faults are sparse [about 60%-70% single isolated faults (SIFs)], we propose further integrating the RR and sECC (named iRRsECC) to optimize the system performance. In this scenario, all the SIFs are masked and the transient faults are corrected with the proposed sECC, while other permanent faulty types (e.g., faulty rows or columns) are repaired with redundant rows or columns. A simulation tool is developed to evaluate the proposed techniques and the evaluation results show their good performance in terms of repair rate and hardware overhead.","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2014.2374291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2014.2374291","startPage":"28","endPage":"39","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503868/7056407/06973044.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7056407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Yield and Reliability Improvement Techniques for Emerging Nonvolatile STT-MRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6973044/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Yield and Reliability Improvement Techniques for Emerging Nonvolatile STT-MRAM","volume":"5","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"14982638","publicationDate":"March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6973044/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"(61071072)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Yield and Reliability Improvement Techniques for Emerging Nonvolatile STT-MRAM","sourcePdf":"jetcas-zhao-2374291-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.167956S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"7056407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"7056407","articleId":"6973044","onlineDate":"03 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6973046,"authors":[{"name":"Chenxin Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7047256/6973046/6973046-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chenxin Zhang (S'09) received his M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Lund University, Sweden, in 2009.

We start our study by defining a system of amplify-and-forward (AF) relay network where relay nodes are empowered with FD capability.

High sensitivity measurements allow even very faint sources to be detected and located, giving insight into processes which have been difficult to observe in the past. However, the location uncertainty of a source degrades as the source becomes fainter. One possible way to improve the source location accuracy is by making many independent measurements of the emission though the use of additional antennae.

The accident is usually caused by the direct and indirect lightning stroke. The effects of direct lightning stroke on floating oil tank have been studied a lot in previous works and there is little research on the influence of lightning stroke in the vicinity of tank. In order to study the indirect effect of lightning on the floating roof oil tanks, this paper proposes a numerical procedure based on finite difference time domain(FDTD) method to compute the electric potential distribution on the large floating oil tanks. The impact of lightning current amplitude, stoke position and soil resistivity on the potential distribution are taken into consideration. From the result, we can conclude that the field strength gets higher with the lightning current amplitude and the soil resistivity increases; decays with the distance further between the stoke point and the oil tank. Besides we calculate the lightning discharge radiation power.","doi":"10.1109/ICLP.2014.6973253","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Lightning Protection (ICLP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Lightning Protection (ICLP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6965095/6971980/06973253.pdf","startPage":"911","endPage":"916","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICLP.2014.6973253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6971980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the effect on the large floating roof oil tanks struck by indirect lightning based on FDTD","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6973253","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-18 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6973253/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the effect on the large floating roof oil tanks struck by indirect lightning based on FDTD","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14792044","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6973253/","conferenceDate":"11-18 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the effect on the large floating roof oil tanks struck by indirect lightning based on FDTD","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"252.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061172S","chronDate":"11-18 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6965095","isNumber":"6971980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6965095","xplore-issue":"6971980","articleId":"6973253","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6973334,"authors":[{"name":"Jingli Li","affiliation":["College of electric engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jingli","lastName":"Li","id":"37598883700"},{"name":"Zhiyuan Qiao","affiliation":["College of electric engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhiyuan","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37085458718"},{"name":"Dongya Wu","affiliation":["Henan electric power dispatching & controlling center, State Grid Henan Electric Power Company, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Dongya","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085473509"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3544-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6973334","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Soil","Grounding","Finite element analysis","Frequency dependence","Conductivity","Mathematical model","Permittivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["earthing","finite element analysis","lightning protection","soil"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FEM model","grounding system impulse characteristic","finite element method","lightning stroke","soil parameter frequency dependence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FEM","soil frequency-dependence","lightning strike","transient","grounding system"]}],"abstract":"A simulation model based on FEM (finite element method) is presented to analyze the impulse characteristic of grounding system under lightning stroke while considering soil parameters' frequency dependence.

We have also evaluated statistical characteristics of obtained lightning current waveforms.","doi":"10.1109/ICLP.2014.6973384","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Lightning Protection (ICLP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Lightning Protection (ICLP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6965095/6971980/06973384.pdf","startPage":"1594","endPage":"1599","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICLP.2014.6973384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6971980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Upward and downward lightning observed at Tokyo Skytree","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6973384","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-18 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6973384/","displayDocTitle":"Upward and downward lightning observed at Tokyo Skytree","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14792214","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6973384/","conferenceDate":"11-18 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Upward and downward lightning observed at Tokyo Skytree","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"429.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073601S","chronDate":"11-18 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6965095","isNumber":"6971980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6965095","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6971980","articleId":"6973384","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6973404,"authors":[{"name":"Rongmei Liu","affiliation":["Electrical Apparatus Reliability, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Rongmei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085366267"},{"name":"Youhua Wang","affiliation":["Electrical Apparatus Reliability, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Youhua","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085364429"},{"name":"Zhenghan Zhao","affiliation":["Electrical Apparatus Reliability, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Zhenghan","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085356544"},{"name":"Yan Zhang","affiliation":["Electrical Apparatus Reliability, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085353607"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3544-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6973404","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lightning","Magnetic fields","Mathematical model","Conductors","Steel","Numerical models","Atmospheric modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bars","building management systems","buildings (structures)","electromagnetic coupling","extrapolation","finite element analysis","lightning protection","magnetic fields","Maxwell equations","steel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic field distribution","metallic grid-like building","lightning struck","finite element method","lightning protection system","LPS","numerical solution","Maxwell equation","frequency domain analysis","electromagnetic coupling","reinforced steel bar","grid-like spatial shield","square mesh","extrapolation","IEC 62305-4 equation","relation theory","distance 10 m","distance 2 m"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lightning protection","magnetic field","buildings","finite element methods","frequency domain"]}],"abstract":"This paper dealt with the evaluation of magnetic field in a lightning protection system (LPS) of a metallic grid-like building.

In this paper, we built an energy consumption model of the Cloud Computing system, by using statistical method we can estimate the energy consumption of a virtual machine in a small range of errors in 3%-6%. Then, based on the model, we proposed a virtual machine scheduling algorithm to improve the energy efficiency of the system. First, we set a threshold value of energy consumption for each server in the system, and by analyzing these work plans submitted by each virtual machine, we tested whether the threshold will been exceeded or not. Then, by migrate one/several chosen virtual machines to other physical servers in the system we can reduce the energy consumption of the whole system. Our evaluation shows that the proposed scheduling algorithm can effectively implement energy-saving goals without significant decline of the Quality of Services.","doi":"10.1109/ISCC-C.2013.38","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Information Science and Cloud Computing Companion","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Information Science and Cloud Computing Companion","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968712/6973551/06973595.pdf","startPage":"219","endPage":"224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCC-C.2013.38","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973551","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Energy-Saving Virtual-Machine Scheduling Algorithm of Cloud Computing System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6973595","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6973595/","displayDocTitle":"An Energy-Saving Virtual-Machine Scheduling Algorithm of Cloud Computing System","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14792768","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6973595/","conferenceDate":"7-8 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Energy-Saving Virtual-Machine Scheduling Algorithm of Cloud Computing System","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"5245a219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08726S","chronDate":"7-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6968712","isNumber":"6973551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968712","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6973551","articleId":"6973595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6973601,"authors":[{"name":"Haiming Lin","affiliation":["Department of Mechanics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Haiming","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085550755"},{"name":"Xiaohu Liu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37599912700"},{"name":"Kangyu Jia","affiliation":["Department of Mechanics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Kangyu","lastName":"Jia","id":"37085561373"},{"name":"Wei Fu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Fu","id":"37085546218"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5245-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6973601","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"abstract":"This paper presents a parallel domain decomposition finite difference time domain (DD-FDTD) algorithm based on MapReduce architectural pattern in a Hadoop cloud computing cluster.

Compared with the existing PNC scheme in which the relay superimposes two users' signals of the same constellation, two users in the proposed VPNC scheme transmit PAM signals with vertical constellation and the relay superimposes two signals of vertical constellation. The closed form BER and SER expressions of the proposed VPNC scheme are also derived in this paper. Simulation results agree well with the theoretical analyses.

In the paper, according to the definition of weak community, we firstly propose a local modularity and then design a new mutation operator with better efficiency based on local modularity. The mutation operator selects the neighbor node that can best embody the definition of weak community structures as mutated result, which makes the mutated candidate solution closer to the optimal solution. Furthermore, to accelerate the emergence of the optimal solution, the roulette selection is integrated into a uniform crossover operator. On the basis of the above works, an improved Genetic Algorithm based on the local modularity (IGALM) is presented for Community detection. The proposed algorithm is tested and compared to the other algorithms on both computer-generated network and real-world networks. The comparative experimental results reflect that the new algorithm is feasible and effective in small and large scale complex networks.","doi":"10.1109/ISCC-C.2013.42","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968712/6973551/06973672.pdf","startPage":"692","endPage":"697","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Information Science and Cloud Computing Companion","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Information Science and Cloud Computing Companion","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCC-C.2013.42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973551","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Genetic Algorithm Based on Local Modularity for Community Detection in Complex Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6973672/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Genetic Algorithm Based on Local Modularity for Community Detection in Complex Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14792829","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6973672/","conferenceDate":"7-8 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Genetic Algorithm Based on Local Modularity for Community Detection in Complex Network","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"5245a692.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078917S","chronDate":"7-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6968712","isNumber":"6973551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968712","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6973551","articleId":"6973672","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6973675,"authors":[{"name":"Xinwu Yang","affiliation":["Intelligent Software Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xinwu","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085462047"},{"name":"Fei Zhai","affiliation":["Intelligent Software Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Zhai","id":"37085456702"},{"name":"Zhuang Ma","affiliation":["Intelligent Software Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhuang","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085475226"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5245-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6973675","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Face recognition","Training","Face","Principal component analysis","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","face recognition","image classification","matrix algebra","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition accuracy","energy image","facial contour","image binaryzation","edge detection method","training samples","matrix logic","matrix operation","test sample","similarity match","two-dimensional structure information","face image classification","eigenvalue problem","Euclidean distance","principal component analysis","sparsity preserving projections","Yale face database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["face recognition","similarity","faceial contour extraction","energy image of facial contour"]}],"abstract":"In order to further improve the effectiveness and enhance practicability of face recognition under guaranteeing the recognition accuracy, this paper proposes a new method of face recognition based on the energy image of facial contour.

Clustering analysis is an unsupervised method to group data set into multiple clusters. Using clustering algorithm to detect anomaly behavior has good scalability and adaptability. This paper mainly focuses on improving k-means clustering algorithm, and uses it to detect the abnormal records. Our goal is to increase the DR value and decrease the FAR value in anomaly detection by calculating appropriate value of parameters and improve the clustering algorithm. In our IE&FSDM algorithm, we use network records' minimum standard information entropy to compute the initial cluster centers. In testing phase, discrepancy metric is introduced to help calculate exact number of clusters in testing data set. Using the results of initial cluster centers calculated in the pre-phase, IE&FSDM compute the actual clusters by converging cluster centers and obtains the actual cluster centers according to the frequency sensitive discrepancy metric. Then comply with the improved k-means algorithm, iterative calculate until divide all network data into corresponding clusters, and according to the results of cluster we can classify the normal and abnormal network behaviors. At last, we use KDD CUP1999 dataset to implement IE&FSDM algorithm. Test results show that comparing with previous clustering methods, IE&FSDM algorithm improve the detection rate of anomaly behavior and reduce the false alarm rate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research of Clustering Algorithm Based on Information Entropy and Frequency Sensitive Discrepancy Metric in Anomaly Detection","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Information Science and Cloud Computing Companion","doi":"10.1109/ISCC-C.2013.108","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Information Science and Cloud Computing Companion","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968712/6973551/06973690.pdf","startPage":"799","endPage":"805","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCC-C.2013.108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973551","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6973690","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6973690/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Research of Clustering Algorithm Based on Information Entropy and Frequency Sensitive Discrepancy Metric in Anomaly Detection","conferenceDate":"7-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6973690/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14806160","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research of Clustering Algorithm Based on Information Entropy and Frequency Sensitive Discrepancy Metric in Anomaly Detection","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"5245a799.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058292S","chronDate":"7-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6968712","isNumber":"6973551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968712","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6973551","articleId":"6973690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6973736,"authors":[{"name":"Haoming Fu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Calgary"],"firstName":"Haoming","lastName":"Fu","id":"37085572335"},{"name":"Zongpeng Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Calgary"],"firstName":"Zongpeng","lastName":"Li","id":"37309823800"},{"name":"Chuan Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Chuan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37308270500"},{"name":"Xiaowen Chu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University"],"firstName":"Xiaowen","lastName":"Chu","id":"37271636500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5063-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5062-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"}],"articleNumber":"6973736","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":281},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Economics","Vectors","Cost accounting","Virtual machining","Educational institutions","Dynamic scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","pricing","resource allocation","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["core-selecting auctions","heterogeneous VM allocation","cloud computing","resource pool","auction-based allocations","VCG auction","strategic bidding behavior","shill bidding","core-selecting VM auctions","combinatorial auctions","price vector space","economic efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Virtual Machine","Auction"]}],"abstract":"In a cloud market, the cloud provider provisions heterogeneous virtual machine (VM) instances from its resource pool, for allocation to cloud users. Auction-based allocations are efficient in assigning VMs to users who value them the most. Existing auction design often overlooks the heterogeneity of VMs, and does not consider dynamic, demand-driven VM provisioning. Moreover, the classic VCG auction leads to unsatisfactory seller revenues and vulnerability to a strategic bidding behavior known as shill bidding. This work presents a new type of core-selecting VM auctions, which are combinatorial auctions that always select bidder charges from the core of the price vector space, with guaranteed economic efficiency under truthful bidding. These auctions represent a comprehensive three-phase mechanism that instructs the cloud provider to judiciously assemble, allocate, and price VM bundles. They are proof against shills, can improve seller revenue over existing auction mechanisms, and can be tailored to maximize truthfulness.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2014.30","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 7th International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 7th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968679/6973706/06973736.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2014.30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973706","startPage":"152","endPage":"159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Core-Selecting Auctions for Dynamically Allocating Heterogeneous VMs in Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6973736","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Core-Selecting Auctions for Dynamically Allocating Heterogeneous VMs in Cloud Computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6973736/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14792728","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6973736/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Core-Selecting Auctions for Dynamically Allocating Heterogeneous VMs in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"5063a152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070781S","chronDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968679","isNumber":"6973706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968679","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6973706","articleId":"6973736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6973738,"authors":[{"name":"Javier Diaz Montes","affiliation":["Rutgers The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, US"],"firstName":"Javier Diaz","lastName":"Montes","id":"37087203091"},{"name":"Mengsong Zou","affiliation":["Rutgers Discovery Informatics Institute, Rutgers University, USA"],"firstName":"Mengsong","lastName":"Zou","id":"37085377966"},{"name":"Rahul Singh","affiliation":["BM T.

The ideas of on-demand access to resources, \"unlimited\" resources as well as interesting pricing models are making scientist to move their workflows into cloud computing. However, the amount of services and different pricing models offered by the providers often overwhelm users when deciding which option is best for them. Moreover, interoperability across providers remains an open topic that forces users to develop specific solutions for each provider. In this paper, we present a service framework that enables the autonomic execution of dynamic workflows in multi-cloud environments. It also allows users to customize scheduling policies to use those resources that best fit their needs. To demonstrate the benefits of this framework, we study the execution of a real scientific workflow, with data dependencies across stages, in a multi-cloud federation using different policies and objective functions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2014.32","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 7th International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 7th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968679/6973706/06973738.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"175","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2014.32","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Workflows in Multi-cloud Marketplaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Workflows in Multi-cloud Marketplaces","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6973738/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14792640","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6973738/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Workflows in Multi-cloud Marketplaces","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"5063a168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073623S","chronDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968679","isNumber":"6973706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968679","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6973706","articleId":"6973738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6973741,"authors":[{"name":"Xue Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering University of Southern California, Los Angeles, U.S."],"firstName":"Xue","lastName":"Lin","id":"38237315300"},{"name":"Yanzhi Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering University of Southern California, Los Angeles, U.S."],"firstName":"Yanzhi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37966617700"},{"name":"Qing Xie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering University of Southern California, Los Angeles, U.S."],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Xie","id":"37955698400"},{"name":"Massoud Pedram","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering University of Southern California, Los Angeles, U.S."],"firstName":"Massoud","lastName":"Pedram","id":"37278158100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5063-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5062-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"}],"articleNumber":"6973741","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":723},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile handsets","Wireless communication","Energy consumption","Cloud computing","Processor scheduling","Time factors","Scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","mobile computing","performance evaluation","power aware computing","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy reduction","performance enhancement","task scheduling problem","mobile cloud computing environment","MCC","minimal-delay scheduling solution","linear-time rescheduling algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mobile cloud computing (MCC)","energy minimization","hard deadline constraint","task scheduling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6973741","abstract":"Mobile cloud computing (MCC) offers significant opportunities in performance enhancement and energy saving in mobile, battery-powered devices. An application running on a mobile device can be represented by a task graph. This work investigates the problem of scheduling tasks (which belong to the same or possibly different applications) in an MCC environment. More precisely, the scheduling problem involves the following steps: (i) determining the tasks to be offloaded on to the cloud, (ii) mapping the remaining tasks onto (potentially heterogeneous) cores in the mobile device, and (iii) scheduling all tasks on the cores (for in-house tasks) or the wireless communication channels (for offloaded tasks) such that the task-precedence requirements and the application completion time constraint are satisfied while the total energy dissipation in the mobile device is minimized. A novel algorithm is presented, which starts from a minimal-delay scheduling solution and subsequently performs energy reduction by migrating tasks among the local cores or between the local cores and the cloud. A linear-time rescheduling algorithm is proposed for the task migration. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve a maximum energy reduction by a factor of 3.1 compared with the baseline algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2014.35","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 7th International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 7th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968679/6973706/06973741.pdf","startPage":"192","endPage":"199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2014.35","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy and Performance-Aware Task Scheduling in a Mobile Cloud Computing Environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6973741/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","displayDocTitle":"Energy and Performance-Aware Task Scheduling in a Mobile Cloud Computing Environment","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6973741/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14792712","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2014","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy and Performance-Aware Task Scheduling in a Mobile Cloud Computing Environment","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"5063a192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071058S","chronDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968679","isNumber":"6973706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968679","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6973706","articleId":"6973741","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6973742,"authors":[{"name":"Shahid Al Noor","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL"],"firstName":"Shahid Al","lastName":"Noor","id":"37085375878"},{"name":"Ragib Hasan","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL"],"firstName":"Ragib","lastName":"Hasan","id":"37419422100"},{"name":"Md Munirul Haque","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL"],"firstName":"Md Munirul","lastName":"Haque","id":"37077018100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5063-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5062-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"}],"articleNumber":"6973742","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":344},"abstract":"Cloud computing has become the dominant computing paradigm in recent years. As clouds evolved, researchers have explored the possibility of building clouds out of loosely associated mobile computing devices. However, most such efforts failed due to the lack of a proper incentive model for the mobile device owners. In this paper, we propose CellCloud - a practical mobile cloud architecture which can be easily deployed on existing cellular phone network infrastructure. It is based on a novel reputation-based economic incentive model in order to compensate the phone owners for the use of their phones as cloud computing nodes. CellCloud offers a practical model for performing cloud operations, with lower costs compared to a traditional cloud. We provide an elaborate analysis of the model with security and economic incentives as major focus. Along with a cost equation model, we discuss detailed results to prove the feasibility of our proposed model. Our simulation results show that CellCloud creates a win-win scenario for all three stakeholders (client, cloud provider, and mobile device owners) to ensure the formation of a successful mobile cloud architecture.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 7th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968679/6973706/06973742.pdf","startPage":"200","endPage":"207","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 7th International Conference on Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2014.36","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2014.36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973706","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6973742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CellCloud: A Novel Cost Effective Formation of Mobile Cloud Based on Bidding Incentives","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Mobile communication","Mobile handsets","Cloud computing","Computer architecture","Mobile computing","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","incentive schemes","mobile computing","mobile handsets","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stakeholders","economic incentives","security incentives","phone owners","reputation-based economic incentive model","cellular phone network infrastructure","CellCloud","mobile cloud architecture","mobile computing devices","cloud computing","bidding incentives","cost effective mobile cloud formation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mobile cloud","bidding","challenges","trustworthiness","cost model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6973742/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","displayDocTitle":"CellCloud: A Novel Cost Effective Formation of Mobile Cloud Based on Bidding Incentives","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6973742/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14792667","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CellCloud: A Novel Cost Effective Formation of Mobile Cloud Based on Bidding Incentives","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"5063a200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108788S","chronDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968679","isNumber":"6973706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968679","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6973706","articleId":"6973742","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6973751,"authors":[{"name":"Sangwhan Moon","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University"],"firstName":"Sangwhan","lastName":"Moon","id":"38252691500"},{"name":"Jaehwan Lee","affiliation":["Memory Solutions Lab, Samsung Semiconductor Inc."],"firstName":"Jaehwan","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085574738"},{"name":"Yang Suk Kee","affiliation":["Memory Solutions Lab, Samsung Semiconductor Inc."],"firstName":"Yang Suk","lastName":"Kee","id":"37071706300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5063-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5062-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"}],"articleNumber":"6973751","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":792},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6973751","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Performance evaluation","Bandwidth","Random access memory","Media","Benchmark testing","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["disc drives","hard discs","parallel processing","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SSD","Hadoop MapReduce Framework","solid state drive","cost-per-bit","hard disk drives","HDD","parallel storage access","Hadoop distributed file system","HDFS source data"]}],"abstract":"Solid State Drive (SSD) cost-per-bit continues to decrease.

Hence, cost-effective SSD utilization has proved challenging within many Hadoop environments. This paper compares SSD performance to HDD performance within a Hadoop MapReduce framework. It identifies extensible best practices that can exploit SSD benefits within Hadoop frameworks when combined with high network bandwidth and increased parallel storage access.

For storage, encryption can be used to protect user's data. But for outsourced data processing, for example MapReduce, there is no satisfying solution.

PFC leverages the security feature of the existing FPGAs originally designed for bitstream IP protection and proxy re-encryption for preserving user data privacy. In PFC, cloud service providers are not necessarily trusted, and during outsourced computation, user's data is protected by a data encryption key only accessible by trusted FPGA devices. As an important application of cloud computing, we apply PFC to the popular MapReduce programming model and extend the FPGA based MapReduce pipeline with privacy protection capabilities. Proxy re-encryption is employed to support dynamic allocations of trusted FPGA devices as mappers and reducers. Finally, we conduct evaluation to demonstrate the effectiveness of PFC.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6973752/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14792676","htmlLink":"/document/6973752/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"PFC: Privacy Preserving FPGA Cloud - A Case Study of MapReduce","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PFC: Privacy Preserving FPGA Cloud - A Case Study of MapReduce","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"5063a280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076928S","chronDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968679","isNumber":"6973706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968679","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6973706","articleId":"6973752","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6973753,"authors":[{"name":"Abdelmounaam Rezgui","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, New Mexico Tech, New Mexico, USA"],"firstName":"Abdelmounaam","lastName":"Rezgui","id":"37671544600"},{"name":"Gary Quezada","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, New Mexico Tech, New Mexico, USA"],"firstName":"Gary","lastName":"Quezada","id":"37085422420"},{"name":"M.

A challenge is to efficiently allocate this dynamic, heterogeneous capacity to a flow of incoming virtual machine (VM) instantiation requests, i.e., maximize the number of virtual machines that may be placed on the VCF. Cloud federations may allocate VMs far more efficiently if they can accurately predict the demand in terms of VM instantiation requests. In this paper, we present a stochastic technique that forecasts future demand to efficiently allocate VMs to VM instantiation requests. Our approach uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation known as the Poisson-Gamma Gibbs (PGG) sampler. The PGG sampler is used to determine the arrival rate of each type of VM instantiation requests. This arrival rate is then used to determine an optimal VM placement for the incoming VM instantiation requests. We compared our approach to a solution that adopts a static smallest-fit approach. The experimental results showed that our solution reacts quickly to abrupt changes in the frequency of VM instantiation requests and performs 10% better than the static smallest-fit approach in terms of the total number of satisfied requests.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2014.47","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 7th International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 7th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968679/6973706/06973753.pdf","startPage":"288","endPage":"295","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2014.47","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Capacity Allocation Approach for Volunteer Cloud Federations Using Poisson-Gamma Gibbs Sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Capacity Allocation Approach for Volunteer Cloud Federations Using Poisson-Gamma Gibbs Sampling","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6973753/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14792637","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6973753/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Capacity Allocation Approach for Volunteer Cloud Federations Using Poisson-Gamma Gibbs Sampling","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"5063a288.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069362S","chronDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968679","isNumber":"6973706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968679","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6973706","articleId":"6973753","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6973778,"authors":[{"name":"Hikaru Horie","affiliation":["Keio University"],"firstName":"Hikaru","lastName":"Horie","id":"38466771200"},{"name":"Masato Asahara","affiliation":["NEC Green Platform Research Laboratories"],"firstName":"Masato","lastName":"Asahara","id":"38466932300"},{"name":"Hiroshi Yamada","affiliation":["Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology.","JST CREST"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Yamada","id":"37085559591"},{"name":"Kenji Kono","affiliation":["JST CREST","Keio University"],"firstName":"Kenji","lastName":"Kono","id":"37437337600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5063-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5062-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"}],"articleNumber":"6973778","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Data transfer","Indexes","Peer-to-peer computing","Distributed databases","Protocols","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","routing protocols","wide area networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inter-datacenter communications","multilayered DHT","ML-DHT","local first data rebuilding","LDR","key value pairs","storage capacity","routing protocol","routing hops","interdatacenter connections","erasure coding techniques","KVS administrators","chord-based system","storage usage","remote data transfer","DKVS","distributed key-value stores","inter-datacenter environments","single datacenter","cloud services","multiple datacenters","Internet scale services","popular platforms","cloud federations","inter-datacenter key value stores","WAN communications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["key-value store","distributed hash table","datacenter","cloud federations"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimizing WAN Communications in Inter-datacenter Key-Value Stores","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2014.72","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973706","endPage":"497","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 7th International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 7th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968679/6973706/06973778.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2014.72","startPage":"490","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6973778","abstract":"Cloud-federations have emerged as popular platforms for Internet-scale services. Cloud-federations are running over multiple datacenters, because a cloud-federation is an aggregate of cloud services each of which runs in a single datacenter. In such inter-datacenter environments, distributed key-value stores (DKVSs) are attractive databases in terms of scalability. However, inter-datacenter communications degrade the performance of these DKVSs because of their large latency and narrow bandwidth. In this paper, we demonstrate how to reduce and hide the weak points of inter-datacenter communications for DKVSs. To solve the problems we introduce two techniques called multi-layered DHT (ML-DHT) and local-first data rebuilding (LDR). ML-DHT provides a global and consistent index of key-value pairs with the efficient expandability of the storage capacity. It employs a routing protocol which reduces routing hops that pass through interdatacenter connections. LDR reduces data transfer on interdatacenter connections by using erasure coding techniques. It enables KVS administrators to flexibly make trade-offs between expandability of storage capacity and the performance of data transfer. Experimental results demonstrate that our techniques improve the latency up to 74 % compared with a Chord-based system and enable us to balance the amount of storage usage and remote data transfer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6973778/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14792656","htmlLink":"/document/6973778/","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"Minimizing WAN Communications in Inter-datacenter Key-Value Stores","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimizing WAN Communications in Inter-datacenter Key-Value Stores","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"5063a490.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047651S","chronDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968679","isNumber":"6973706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968679","xplore-issue":"6973706","articleId":"6973778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6973786,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Li","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Li","id":"37085474505"},{"name":"Li Guo","affiliation":["School of Computing Engineering and Physical Science, University of Central Lancashire, Preston, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Guo","id":"37085454449"},{"name":"Akara Supratak","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Akara","lastName":"Supratak","id":"37085459019"},{"name":"Yike Guo","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Yike","lastName":"Guo","id":"37277882400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5063-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5062-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"}],"articleNumber":"6973786","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Data models","Servers","File systems","Aerospace electronics","Algorithm design and analysis","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","cloud computing","linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance as a service","multitier cloud storage system","CACSS","linear programming model","data access patterns","data caching management","caching algorithm","cloud economy","performance improvement","revenue-gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Storage","Cloud Computing","Performance as a Service","Big Data"]}],"abstract":"One of the main contributions of the paper is that we introduce \"performance as a service\" as a key component for future cloud storage environments.

In this paper, we present RESeED, a tool which provides user-transparent and cloud-agnostic search over encrypted data using regular expressions without requiring cloud providers to make changes to their existing infrastructure. When a client asks RESeED to upload a new file in the cloud, RESeED analyzes the file's content and updates novel data structures accordingly, encrypting and transferring the new data to the cloud. RESeED provides regular expression search over this encrypted data by translating queries on-the-fly to finite automata and analyzes efficient and secure representations of the data before asking the cloud to download the encrypted files. We evaulate a working prototype of RESeED experimentally (currently publicly available) and show the scalability and correctness of our approach using real-world data sets from arXiv.org and the IETF. We show absolute accuracy for RESeED, with very low (6%) overhead, and high performability, even beating grep for some benchmarks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 7th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968679/6973706/06973801.pdf","startPage":"673","endPage":"680","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 7th International Conference on Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2014.95","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2014.95","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973706","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6973801","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RESeED: Regular Expression Search over Encrypted Data in the Cloud","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Benchmark testing","Encryption","Automata","Indexes","Data structures","Keyword search"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cryptography","data structures","finite automata","query processing","trusted computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RESeED tool","cloud-agnostic search","user-transparent search","regular expression search","query translation","finite automata","secure data representation","grep","arXiv.org","IETF","trustworthy cloud-based computing","data storage"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","security","privacy","searchable encryption","regular expression"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6973801/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","displayDocTitle":"RESeED: Regular Expression Search over Encrypted Data in the Cloud","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6973801/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14792651","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RESeED: Regular Expression Search over Encrypted Data in the Cloud","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"5063a673.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059134S","chronDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968679","isNumber":"6973706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968679","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6973706","articleId":"6973801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6973811,"authors":[{"name":"Takayuki Kushida","affiliation":["Cloud SSA Hub, IBM Global Technology Services, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Takayuki","lastName":"Kushida","id":"37339943800"},{"name":"Gopal S.

These systems need to provide high throughput with low latency, which is a difficult task to achieve. Manual performance tuning and diagnosis of such systems, however, is hard as the amount of relevant performance diagnosis data is large. To help system developers with performance diagnosis, we have developed a tool called Performance Anomaly Detector (PAD). PAD combines user-driven navigation analysis with automatic correlation and comparative analysis techniques. The combination results in a powerful tool that can help find a number of performance anomalies. Based on our experience in applying PAD to the Orleans system, we discovered that PAD was able to reduce developer time and effort detecting anomalous performance cases and improve a developer's ability to perform deeper analysis of such behaviors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAD: Performance Anomaly Detection in Multi-server Distributed Systems","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 7th International Conference on Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2014.107","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 7th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968679/6973706/06973813.pdf","startPage":"769","endPage":"776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2014.107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973706","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6973813","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6973813/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","displayDocTitle":"PAD: Performance Anomaly Detection in Multi-server Distributed Systems","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6973813/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14792743","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAD: Performance Anomaly Detection in Multi-server Distributed Systems","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"5063a769.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074922S","chronDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968679","isNumber":"6973706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968679","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6973706","articleId":"6973813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6973826,"authors":[{"name":"Dariusz Kr\u00f3l","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Academic Computer Centre Cyfronet AGH, AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow, Poland"],"firstName":"Dariusz","lastName":"Kr\u00f3l","id":"38337405500"},{"name":"Renata Slota","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Academic Computer Centre Cyfronet AGH, AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow, Poland"],"firstName":"Renata","lastName":"Slota","id":"37540926600"},{"name":"Jacek Kitowski","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Academic Computer Centre Cyfronet AGH, AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow, Poland"],"firstName":"Jacek","lastName":"Kitowski","id":"37397529500"},{"name":"Lukasz Dutka","affiliation":["AGH University of Science and Technology Academic Computer Centre Cyfronet AGH, Krakow, Poland"],"firstName":"Lukasz","lastName":"Dutka","id":"38201945000"},{"name":"Jakub Liput","affiliation":["AGH University of Science and Technology Academic Computer Centre Cyfronet AGH, Krakow, Poland"],"firstName":"Jakub","lastName":"Liput","id":"37085420916"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5063-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5062-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"}],"articleNumber":"6973826","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Computational modeling","Unified modeling language","Monitoring","Concrete","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","cloud computing","data analysis","genetic algorithms","processor scheduling","travelling salesman problems","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simulation-based virtual experiments","Scalarm platform","data farming","private cloud","cloud usage unification","virtual machine scheduling","authentication","virtual machine state monitoring","genetic algorithm","travel salesman problem","public cloud","commercial cloud"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["data farming","simulation platforms","distributed systems","heterogeneous Clouds"]}],"abstract":"Using multiple Clouds as a single environment to conduct simulation-based virtual experiments at a large-scale is a challenging problem.

In this paper, we present Progger (Provenance Logger), a kernel-space logger which potentially empowers all cloud stakeholders to trace their data. Logging from the kernel space empowers security analysts to collect provenance from the lowest possible atomic data actions, and enables several higher-level tools to be built for effective end-to-end tracking of data provenance. Within the last few years, there has been an increasing number of proposed kernel space provenance tools but they faced several critical data security and integrity problems. Some of these prior tools' limitations include (1) the inability to provide log tamper-evidence and prevention of fake/manual entries, (2) accurate and granular timestamp synchronisation across several machines, (3) log space requirements and growth, and (4) the efficient logging of root usage of the system. Progger has resolved all these critical issues, and as such, provides high assurance of data security and data activity audit. With this in mind, the paper will discuss these elements of high-assurance cloud data provenance, describe the design of Progger and its efficiency, and present compelling results which paves the way for Progger being a foundation tool used for data activity tracking across all cloud systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6973827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6973827/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14792730","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Progger: An Efficient, Tamper-Evident Kernel-Space Logger for Cloud Data Provenance Tracking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Progger: An Efficient, Tamper-Evident Kernel-Space Logger for Cloud Data Provenance Tracking","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"5063a881.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046243S","chronDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968679","isNumber":"6973706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968679","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6973706","articleId":"6973827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6973835,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Imran Jehangiri","affiliation":["Gesellschaft f\u00fcr wissenschaftliche Datenverarbeitung mbH G\u00f6ttingen (GWDG), G\u00f6ttingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Ali Imran","lastName":"Jehangiri","id":"37085437658"},{"name":"Ramin Yahyapour","affiliation":["Gesellschaft f\u00fcr wissenschaftliche Datenverarbeitung mbH G\u00f6ttingen (GWDG), G\u00f6ttingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Ramin","lastName":"Yahyapour","id":"37299742600"},{"name":"Philipp Wieder","affiliation":["Gesellschaft f\u00fcr wissenschaftliche Datenverarbeitung mbH G\u00f6ttingen (GWDG), G\u00f6ttingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Philipp","lastName":"Wieder","id":"37329466300"},{"name":"Edwin Yaqub","affiliation":["Gesellschaft f\u00fcr wissenschaftliche Datenverarbeitung mbH G\u00f6ttingen (GWDG), G\u00f6ttingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Edwin","lastName":"Yaqub","id":"38234636500"},{"name":"Kuan Lu","affiliation":["Gesellschaft f\u00fcr wissenschaftliche Datenverarbeitung mbH G\u00f6ttingen (GWDG), G\u00f6ttingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Kuan","lastName":"Lu","id":"38238340300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5063-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5062-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"}],"articleNumber":"6973835","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":417},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Time series analysis","Monitoring","Scalability","Time factors","Cloud computing","Distributed databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data analysis","forecasting theory","parallel processing","quality of service","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud performance anomaly diagnosis","large time series dataset analysis","virtualized cloud platforms","online services","distributed parallel approach","Holt-Winters forecasting","automatic aberrant behavior detection","MapReduce paradigm","service level objective","SLO","production cloud","IaaS service models","PaaS service models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud","Performance Diagnosis","Monitoring","QoS","Analytics","Distributed Time-Series database"]}],"abstract":"Virtualized Cloud platforms have become increasingly common and the number of online services hosted on these platforms is also increasing rapidly. A key problem faced by providers in managing these services is detecting the performance anomalies and adjusting resources accordingly. As online services generate a very large amount of monitored data in the form of time series, it becomes very difficult to process this complex data by traditional approaches. In this work, we present a novel distributed parallel approach for performance anomaly detection. We build upon Holt-Winters forecasting for automatic aberrant behavior detection in time series. First, we extend the technique to work with MapReduce paradigm. Next, we correlate the anomalous metrics with the target Service Level Objective (SLO) in order to locate the suspicious metrics. We implemented and evaluated our approach on a production Cloud encompassing IaaS and PaaS service models. Experimental results confirm that our approach is efficient and effective in capturing the metrics causing performance anomalies in large time series datasets.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diagnosing Cloud Performance Anomalies Using Large Time Series Dataset Analysis","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 7th International Conference on Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2014.129","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 7th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968679/6973706/06973835.pdf","startPage":"930","endPage":"933","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2014.129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973706","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6973835","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6973835/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","displayDocTitle":"Diagnosing Cloud Performance Anomalies Using Large Time Series Dataset Analysis","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6973835/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14792740","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diagnosing Cloud Performance Anomalies Using Large Time Series Dataset Analysis","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"5063a930.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042003S","chronDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968679","isNumber":"6973706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968679","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6973706","articleId":"6973835","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6973837,"authors":[{"name":"Congyingzi Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, OH"],"firstName":"Congyingzi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085417818"},{"name":"Robert Green","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, OH"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Green","id":"37532258600"},{"name":"Mansoor Alam","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Toledo, Toledo, OH"],"firstName":"Mansoor","lastName":"Alam","id":"37349858700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5063-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5062-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"}],"articleNumber":"6973837","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":669},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reliability","Cloud computing","Monte Carlo methods","Green products","Computational modeling","System performance","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","Monte Carlo methods","reliability","system recovery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CCS utilization evaluation","CCS reliability evaluation","cloud computing system","device partial failure","graceful service degrading","system reliability","device utilization","multistate system","multistate devices","nonsequential Monte Carlo simulation","MCS","utilization index"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","multi-state","reliability","utilization","Monte Carlo Simulation"]}],"abstract":"Maintaining high reliability and device utilization in a cloud computing system (CCS) is crucial to any cloud service provider who will face high penalties and lose revenues if they fail to be good at both. This study proposes that allowing device partial failure in a CCS for graceful service degrading would help to obtain higher system reliability and device utilization without purchasing extra resource for the system. A model is created to represent such a multi-state system composed of multi-state devices. The system model is evaluated with Non-sequential Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) on its reliability and device utilization. The preliminary results positively suggest that introducing and adding device multi-state increases the CCS reliability against device failures during simulation. Also, for the less reliable devices, like HDD, the results recommended a higher multi-state to compensate for their vulnerability and negative effect on system performance. A utilization index along all device dimensions is proposed in this research for a wise decision about maintaining a well-balanced and high utilized system at a lower cost.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2014.131","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 7th International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 7th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968679/6973706/06973837.pdf","startPage":"936","endPage":"937","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2014.131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973706","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability and Utilization Evaluation of a Cloud Computing System Allowing Partial Failures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6973837","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6973837/","displayDocTitle":"Reliability and Utilization Evaluation of a Cloud Computing System Allowing Partial Failures","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14792686","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6973837/","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability and Utilization Evaluation of a Cloud Computing System Allowing Partial Failures","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"5063a936.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04538S","chronDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968679","isNumber":"6973706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968679","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6973706","articleId":"6973837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":6973857,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Aazam","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Kyung Hee University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Aazam","id":"37589584100"},{"name":"Eui Nam Huh","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Kyung Hee University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Eui Nam","lastName":"Huh","id":"37326597300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5063-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5062-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"}],"articleNumber":"6973857","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1923},"abstract":"The rapid increase in digital content, specially multimedia, calls now for standardization of Media Cloud and Inter-Cloud computing, for better provisioning of services.

It is characterized by combining a Bayesian network and evolutionary algorithms to solve nearly decomposable optimization problems. BOA is less popularly applied to solve high dimensionality complex optimization problems. A key reason is that the cost of training all dimensions by BOA becomes expensive with the increase of problem dimensionality. Since data are relatively sparse in a high dimensional space, even though BOA can train all dimensions simultaneously, the interdependent relations between different dimensions are difficult to learn. Its search ability is thus significantly reduced. In this paper, we propose a team of Bayesian optimization algorithms (TBOA) to search and learn dimensionality. TBOA consists of multiple BOAs, in which each BOA corresponds to a dimension of the solution domain and it is responsible for the search of this dimension's value region. The proposed TBOA is used to solve the real problem of task assignment in heterogeneous computing systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the computational cost of the overall training in TBOA is decreased very significantly while keeping high solution accuracy.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6960119/6973862/06973895.pdf","startPage":"127","endPage":"132","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2014.6973895","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2014.6973895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973862","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6973895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Team of Bayesian optimization algorithms to solve task assignment problems in heterogeneous computing systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayes methods","Sociology","Statistics","Optimization","Computational efficiency","Joints","Probability distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","distributed algorithms","evolutionary computation","learning (artificial intelligence)","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["task assignment problems","estimation of distribution algorithms","EDA","Bayesian network","evolutionary algorithms","decomposable optimization problems","high dimensionality complex optimization problems","problem dimensionality","high dimensional space","search ability","team of Bayesian optimization algorithms","TBOA","dimensionality search","dimensionality learning","dimension value region","heterogeneous computing systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA)","Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA)","dimensionality learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6973895/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Team of Bayesian optimization algorithms to solve task assignment problems in heterogeneous computing systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6973895/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14790166","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Team of Bayesian optimization algorithms to solve task assignment problems in heterogeneous computing systems","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0127ID1927.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114979S","chronDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6960119","isNumber":"6973862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6960119","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6973862","articleId":"6973895","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6973916,"authors":[{"name":"Cen Cao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Cen","lastName":"Cao","id":"37085422750"},{"name":"Qingjian Ni","affiliation":["College of Software Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Provincial Key Laboratory for Computer Information Processing Technology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qingjian","lastName":"Ni","id":"37085420332"},{"name":"Xushan Yin","affiliation":["College of Software Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xushan","lastName":"Yin","id":"37085401390"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3840-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6973916","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":417},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Wireless sensor networks","Sociology","Statistics","Heuristic algorithms","Particle swarm optimization","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","swarm intelligence","telecommunication computing","telecommunication network topology","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","PSO","wireless sensor network","WSN","node localization","swarm intelligence","ring topology","square topology"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6973916","abstract":"The node localization in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) presently plays an important role in the field of applications.

Numerical results indicate the superiority of ENN over ANN in terms of accuracy and stability.","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2014.6973926","startPage":"311","endPage":"316","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2014.6973926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973862","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6960119/6973862/06973926.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wind power forecasting using emotional neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6973926/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Wind power forecasting using emotional neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6973926/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14790304","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wind power forecasting using emotional neural networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0311ID1521.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085156S","chronDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6960119","isNumber":"6973862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6960119","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6973862","articleId":"6973926","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6973974,"authors":[{"name":"Arif Jamal Malik","affiliation":["Department of Software Engineering, Foundation University Rawalpindi Campus, Rawalpindi, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Arif Jamal","lastName":"Malik","id":"37721276300"},{"name":"Farrukh Aslam Khan","affiliation":["Department of Software Engineering, Foundation University Rawalpindi Campus, Rawalpindi, Pakistan","Center of Excellence in Information Assurance (CoEIA), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Farrukh Aslam","lastName":"Khan","id":"37677677900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3840-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6973974","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6973974","abstract":"Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a population based optimization technique, has two intrinsic problems of slow convergence and tendency to converge prematurely. In order to overcome these problems, we propose an improvement to the velocity update equation of the standard PSO algorithm in which particles of a swarm tend to move towards the global best position more rapidly as compared to the local best position. Two different non-linear weight factors are multiplied with the two parts of the velocity update equation; one that tends to move the particle to the global best position, while the other tends to move the particle back to its local best position achieved so far. By introducing the separate weight factors, a significant improvement in the results is seen. We test the proposed algorithm on six benchmark functions and the simulation results are presented. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm does not converge prematurely and its convergence speed is faster than the standard PSO algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2014.6973974","startPage":"602","endPage":"607","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6960119/6973862/06973974.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2014.6973974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization with non-linear velocity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Standards","Convergence","Equations","Particle swarm optimization","Optimization","Mathematical model","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","nonlinear velocity","population based optimization technique","nonlinear weight factors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization","Sigmoid Function","Swarm Intelligence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6973974/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization with non-linear velocity","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6973974/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14790163","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle Swarm Optimization with non-linear velocity","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0602ID1941.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060527S","chronDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6960119","isNumber":"6973862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6960119","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6973862","articleId":"6973974","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6974009,"authors":[{"name":"Khaled M.

This work considers the global analysis of seven-joint manipulators that have been designed to be locally optimal in terms of fault tolerance when used for six-dimensional tasks. An algorithm for calculating a six-dimensional volume that is composed of a three-dimensional positioning component and a three-dimensional orientation component is presented. Two example manipulators are then analyzed and compared, illustrating a wide degree of variability between their global fault tolerant properties.

This research successfully demonstrates a model for optimizing SIFT using block convolution pre-filtering. A method is presented which theoretically reduces SIFT run time by nearly 50% by greatly limiting the area of image regions required to search for SIFT features. The block convolution of an image is computed using a kernel designed to be predictive of potential regions of interest. The performance of several different types of kernels are compared, most of which were produced using an evolutionary search algorithm. The filtered image is used to locate the potential regions of interest and mask regions that are unlikely to produce matches. This model will provide the framework for an optimized hardware implementation of SIFT in scenarios requiring low power and high speed, such as a robotic computer vision system. The advantage of the model lies in the very low computational intensity required to mask areas of the image where a match is unlikely to be found, yielding a more efficient implementation of SIFT.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Filtering","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","feature extraction","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational intensity","robotic computer vision system","evolutionary search algorithm","image regions","block convolution pre-filtering","scale invariant feature transform","masking techniques","subsampled convolution","SIFT processing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SMC.2014.6974018","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6960119/6973862/06974018.pdf","startPage":"852","endPage":"857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973862","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2014.6974018","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient SIFT processing using sub-sampled convolution and masking techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974018","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient SIFT processing using sub-sampled convolution and masking techniques","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974018/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6974018/","accessionNumber":"14805673","conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient SIFT processing using sub-sampled convolution and masking techniques","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0852ID1839.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0488S","chronDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6960119","isNumber":"6973862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6960119","xplore-issue":"6973862","articleId":"6974018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6974037,"authors":[{"name":"Brandon M Reese","firstName":"Brandon M","lastName":"Reese"},{"name":"Emmanuel Collins","firstName":"Emmanuel","lastName":"Collins"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3840-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6974037","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptation models","Computational modeling","Neural networks","Predictive models","Optimization","Fuels","Predictive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","combustion","graph theory","MIMO systems","nonlinear control systems","optimisation","predictive control","radial basis function networks","sampling methods","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling based control","combustion process","neural network model","closed-loop nonlinear model predictive control","adaptive NMPC methods","multiple input multiple output systems","MIMO systems","sampling based model predictive control","pseudo-random sampling","nonlinear plant","graph search method","radial basis function neural network","nonlinear system modeling","minimal resource allocation network","MRAN learning algorithm","adaptive SBMPC","chemical concentration control","steam boiler combustion chamber","3-state time-varying nonlinear model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974037","abstract":"An important application of neural networks is the identification of the dynamics of a nonlinear system with no known closed-form model, especially a system whose dynamic behavior may change with time. When this is done quickly and robustly, the model may be used for closed-loop Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). NMPC methods that rely on linearization about an equilibrium point or excessive parameter tuning require a priori information that limits the robustness of those methods for a system with changing dynamic behavior. This paper presents a novel method for adaptive NMPC of multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) systems, called Sampling Based Model Predictive Control (SBMPC) that, like most MPC approaches, has the ability to enforce hard constraints on the system inputs and states. However, unlike other NMPC methods, it does not rely on linearizing the system or gradient based optimization. Instead, it discretizes the input space to the model via pseudo-random sampling and feeds the sampled inputs through the nonlinear plant, hence producing a graph for which an optimal path can be found using an efficient graph search method such as A* optimization. Although SBMPC can be applied to any form of a nonlinear model, here a radial basis function neural network is used to model the nonlinear system due to its ability to represent a very general class of nonlinear systems. Using the Minimal Resource Allocation Network (MRAN) learning algorithm, the neural network size and parameter values may be adjusted even while the controller is active. After presenting the general methodology, Adaptive SBMPC is used in simulation to control the chemical concentrations of flue gas exiting a steam boiler's combustion chamber, represented by a 3-state time-varying nonlinear model with two inputs and three outputs.","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2014.6974037","pdfPath":"/iel7/6960119/6973862/06974037.pdf","startPage":"966","endPage":"972","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2014.6974037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling based control of a combustion process using a neural network model","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974037/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Sampling based control of a combustion process using a neural network model","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14790430","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6974037/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling based control of a combustion process using a neural network model","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0966ID1545.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067177S","chronDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6960119","isNumber":"6973862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6960119","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6973862","articleId":"6974037","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6974045,"authors":[{"name":"Azad M.

These interactions and dependencies tend to produce unpredictable behaviors that can often lead to detrimental outcomes. Traditional systems engineering that relies on reductive approaches are not suitable for the analysis and design of complex systems. This recognition has led to the development of new paradigms, methods, and tools that better enable: exploration of a complex system's behavior and tradespace; detection, diagnosis, and visualization of component/subsystem dependencies and interactions; and identification, alerting, and circumvention of potentially undesirable interactions. This paper presents a system model-driven interactive storytelling approach for analyzing interactions and dependencies within complex systems, and between complex systems and the environment. An exemplar complex system is used to convey key elements of the approach. The methodology is applicable for a variety of complex systems such as global supply chains, power and energy management, transportation networks, aerospace and aviation enterprises, and defense systems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973862","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2014.6974045","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6960119/6973862/06974045.pdf","startPage":"1008","endPage":"1013","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2014.6974045","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring and assessing complex systems' behavior through model-driven storytelling","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Exploring and assessing complex systems' behavior through model-driven storytelling","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6974045/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14789942","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974045/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring and assessing complex systems' behavior through model-driven storytelling","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1008ID2015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050676S","chronDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6960119","isNumber":"6973862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6960119","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6973862","articleId":"6974045","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6974063,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Li","affiliation":["Department of Transportation, Fujian University of Technology, Fuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Li","id":"37599145700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3840-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6974063","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974063","abstract":"Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a daughter of artificial society and social learning.

Detection of this posture is the necessary function for the festination detection system which can work as a quantitative tool for early detection of Parkinson's disease.","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2014.6974074","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6960119/6973862/06974074.pdf","startPage":"1181","endPage":"1185","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2014.6974074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forward-flexed posture detection for the early Parkinson'S disease symptom","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974074/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Forward-flexed posture detection for the early Parkinson'S disease symptom","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6974074/","accessionNumber":"14789964","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forward-flexed posture detection for the early Parkinson'S disease symptom","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1181ID1764.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053862S","chronDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6960119","isNumber":"6973862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6960119","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6973862","articleId":"6974074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6974075,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Cheng Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Yu-Cheng","lastName":"Kuo","id":"38231119000"},{"name":"Chen-Yun Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Chen-Yun","lastName":"Kuo","id":"37085434107"},{"name":"Chung-Hsien Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Chung-Hsien","lastName":"Kuo","id":"37422231500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3840-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6974075","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":316},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Instruments","Resistors","Power supplies","Electromyography","Electrocardiography","Microcontrollers","Electrodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","analogue-digital conversion","biomedical education","biomedical equipment","educational courses","electrical engineering education","electrocardiography","electromyography","electro-oculography","microcontrollers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable biopotential amplifiers","medical instrumentation course","department of electrical engineering","biopotential signals measurement","electromyography","electrocardiography","electrooculography","circuit board reconfigurations","circuit modules","filters design","biopotential signal sources","variable resistors","amplifier gains","frequency conditions","microcontroller","analog-digital signal conversion","USB node","DC power","serial data communication","learning achievements","hands-on skills","amplifiers design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Medical instrumentations","reconfigurable instruments","biopotential amplifiers","instrument designs"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974075","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2014.6974075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2014.6974075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973862","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6960119/6973862/06974075.pdf","startPage":"1186","endPage":"1191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing a reconfigurable biopotential amplifiers for medical instrumentation course","abstract":"This paper proposes a reconfigurable biopotential amplifier for a medical instrumentation course in the department of electrical engineering. With the reconfigurable biopotential amplifier, the students are able to measure their biopotential signals such as electromyography, electrocardiography and electrooculography in the class. In addition, reconfigurations of the circuit board can be achieved by forming different combinations of the circuit modules to investigate the effects of employing the amplifiers and filters, as well as to practice the topics of various biopotential signal sources in terms of adjusting the configurations of the circuit board. At the same time, variable resistors are further used to adjust the amplifier gains and frequency conditions. Moreover, a microcontroller is provided for converting the analog signals to digital forms so that the biopotential signals can be displayed and recorded with a computer program. Therefore, the reconfigurable biopotential amplifier is a low cost and compact educational tool. The students can practice this module only with a personal computer which connects a USB node to provide the DC power and serial data communication. In addition to the improvement on the learning achievements for the biopotential signal measurement experiments within the lecture topics in the medical instrumentation course, the reconfigurable biopotential amplifier also benefits the hands-on skills of students for designing the amplifiers and filters in medical instrumentations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974075/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6974075/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14790374","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Designing a reconfigurable biopotential amplifiers for medical instrumentation course","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing a reconfigurable biopotential amplifiers for medical instrumentation course","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1186ID1972.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052715S","chronDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6960119","isNumber":"6973862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6960119","xplore-issue":"6973862","articleId":"6974075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6974080,"authors":[{"name":"Ping Jiang","affiliation":["School of Au-tomation, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China","School of Computer Science and Technology, Hubei PolyTechnic University, Huangshi, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085428729"},{"name":"Zhigang Zeng","affiliation":["School of Au-tomation, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Zhigang","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37274114100"},{"name":"Jiejie Chen","affiliation":["School of Au-tomation, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Jiejie","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085447619"},{"name":"Huiming Tang","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, China University of Geo-sciences, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Huiming","lastName":"Tang","id":"37085385488"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3840-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6974080","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974080","abstract":"In this study, a modified method for the displacement of landslide prediction is presented.

These techniques have multiple variants that often work well for detecting a particular anomaly. In this paper, we use the decision tree and fuzzy rough set methods for feature selection.

Transfer learning studies on shallow architectures show low performance as they are generally based on hand-crafted features obtained from experts. It is therefore interesting to study transference on deep architectures, known to directly extract the features from the input data. A Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDA) is a deep model able to represent the hierarchical features needed for solving classification problems. In this paper we study the performance of SDAs trained on one problem and reused to solve a different problem not only with different distribution but also with a different tasks. We propose two different approaches: 1) unsupervised feature transference, and 2) supervised feature transference using deep transfer learning. We show that SDAs using the unsupervised feature transference outperform randomly initialized machines on a new problem. We achieved 7% relative improvement on average error rate and 41% on average computation time to classify typed uppercase letters. In the case of supervised feature transference, we achieved 5.7% relative improvement in the average error rate, by reusing the first and second hidden layer, and 8.5% relative improvement for the average error rate and 54% speed up w.r.t the baseline by reusing all three hidden layers for the same data.

However, when facing noisy environments, its performance suffers from unexpected noise. To address this issue, one of the widely-used mechanisms is the resampling method that is based on the fact that the true objective value can be achieved by re-evaluations. Such method allocates a fixed number of re-evaluations before running but cannot change allocations according to the current environment adaptively. It may result in the waste of re-evaluations allocated to unpromising candidate particles. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach by integrating PSO with Learning Automata (LAs) in noisy environments. LAs are well-known for their self-adaption, automatic learning capability as well as low computational complexity. They are able to converge in different situations. The proposed hybrid approach achieves much faster convergence than the existing ones by performing fewer re-evaluations in simple environments than in complex one automatically. This mechanism enables it to find the best particle efficiently. With its self-adaption and automatic learning capability, it leads to a more accurate and faster algorithm. Besides, its distinct selection mechanism helps it achieve a significantly lower computational complexity than that of the-state-of-the-art resampling methods. Through experiments on 20 large-scale benchmark functions subject to different levels of noise, it is validated that, the proposed approach is able to achieve much better performance results in terms of accuracy and convergence rate than the existing ones.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974116/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14790432","htmlLink":"/document/6974116/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Integrating Particle Swarm Optimization with Learning Automata to solve optimization problems in noisy environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating Particle Swarm Optimization with Learning Automata to solve optimization problems in noisy environment","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1432ID1918.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047705S","chronDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6960119","isNumber":"6973862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6960119","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6973862","articleId":"6974116","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6974130,"authors":[{"name":"Rolf Boink","affiliation":["Department of Aerospace Engineering, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Rolf","lastName":"Boink","id":"37085547424"},{"name":"Marinus M. van Paassen","affiliation":["Department of Aerospace Engineering, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Marinus M.","lastName":"van Paassen","id":"37394673500"},{"name":"Mark Mulder","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Mulder","id":"37425793200"},{"name":"David A.

Many such systems generate torques using a simplified and constant lane-keeping model based on a look-ahead controller, without accounting for individual differences. Literature on haptic steering support shows beneficial effects (reduced control activity and increased performance) under experimental conditions, but also report increased steering torques. In this study, we hypothesized that increased interacting torques are the results of small conflicts between human and a constant haptic support system and that these conflicts may be mitigated by adapting the parameters of the look-ahead controller to best match each individual driver, essentially providing individualized guidance torques. Results showed that this approach provides a better match in terms of desired steering wheel angles, however this did not lead to a relevant reduction in steering torques, as discrepancies in timing and lateral error continued to exist. Future adaptations to the haptic shared control algorithm should take more realistic driver control models into consideration.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2014.6974130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973862","startPage":"1510","endPage":"1515","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6960119/6973862/06974130.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding and reducing conflicts between driver and haptic shared control","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974130/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6974130/","displayDocTitle":"Understanding and reducing conflicts between driver and haptic shared control","conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14790291","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding and reducing conflicts between driver and haptic shared control","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1510ID1283.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051948S","chronDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6960119","isNumber":"6973862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6960119","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6973862","articleId":"6974130","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6974172,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Han Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering National Cheng Kung University, aiRobots Laboratory, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Ming-Han","lastName":"Lee","id":"38239780700"},{"name":"Tsung-Cheng Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering National Cheng Kung University, aiRobots Laboratory, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Tsung-Cheng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085526935"},{"name":"Tzuu-Hseng S.

Each fuzzy control structure can be defined by a different bee hive, which contains the control structure and dimension of the gain. The presented DNA+QBGA can make the membership functions and rules communicate with one another among different control structures. Moreover, a novel three-step crossover operation is investigated such that the crossover between different odd dimensions of membership functions can be made. Step one is that the dimensions of parents (queen and drone) and the offspring (brood) are expanded to the same dimension resolved by their least common multiple. Step two is to randomly select the genes from the parents in the corresponding space. Step three is that the offspring gene is calculated by the real-code crossover between their parents. Finally, the simulation results of the fuzzy controlled cart-pole and chaotic systems demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed schemes.","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2014.6974172","startPage":"1765","endPage":"1770","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2014.6974172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973862","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6960119/6973862/06974172.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy controller design by artificial DNA assisted queen bee genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974172/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy controller design by artificial DNA assisted queen bee genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6974172/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14790084","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy controller design by artificial DNA assisted queen bee genetic algorithm","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1765ID1361.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088225S","chronDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6960119","isNumber":"6973862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6960119","xplore-issue":"6973862","articleId":"6974172","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6974184,"authors":[{"name":"Yung-Fa Huang","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Technology, Chaoyang, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yung-Fa","lastName":"Huang","id":"37335701600"},{"name":"Tan-Hsu Tan","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tan-Hsu","lastName":"Tan","id":"37085408159"},{"name":"Shing-Hong Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Chaoyang University of Technology"],"firstName":"Shing-Hong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292596000"},{"name":"Rung-Ching Chen","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, Chaoyang University of Technology"],"firstName":"Rung-Ching","lastName":"Chen","id":"37693219400"},{"name":"Chia-Hsin Cheng","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, National Formosa University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Hsin","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37277349000"},{"name":"Che-Hao Li","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Chaoyang University of Technology"],"firstName":"Che-Hao","lastName":"Li","id":"37085457155"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3840-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6974184","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"abstract":"In this paper, both effective bandwidth extension and distributed issues are investigated to improve the energy efficiency for the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) wireless communication systems.

Experimental results indicate that MPSO-TS not only can achieve the best performance but also spends the minimum CPU time per generation as compared to the existing PSO-based optimization approaches.","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2014.6974186","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6960119/6973862/06974186.pdf","startPage":"1831","endPage":"1835","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2014.6974186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mixing PSO and Tabu search technique and its application to estimation of carrier frequency offsets for uplink OFDMA system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974186","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974186/","displayDocTitle":"Mixing PSO and Tabu search technique and its application to estimation of carrier frequency offsets for uplink OFDMA system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14805668","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6974186/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mixing PSO and Tabu search technique and its application to estimation of carrier frequency offsets for uplink OFDMA system","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1831ID1763.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046436S","chronDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6960119","isNumber":"6973862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6960119","xplore-issue":"6973862","articleId":"6974186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6974214,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Qin","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Qin","id":"37085569259"},{"name":"Shiji Song","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shiji","lastName":"Song","id":"37332904400"},{"name":"Gao Huang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Gao","lastName":"Huang","id":"37274328900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3840-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6974214","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":199},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974214","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Linear programming","Training","Algorithm design and analysis","Artificial neural networks","Principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","pattern classification","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear supervised metric learning algorithm","nonlinear neighborhood component analysis method","constructive neural networks","network size","training process","stochastic variant","leave-one-out K-nearest neighbor score","KNN score","nonlinear metric","KNN classification","linear transformations","low-dimensional nonlinear mapping","visualization","fast classification","dimensionality reduction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SMC.2014.6974214","pdfPath":"/iel7/6960119/6973862/06974214.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","startPage":"1997","endPage":"2002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973862","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2014.6974214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-linear neighborhood component analysis based on constructive neural networks","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel non-linear supervised metric learning algorithm.

In this way, the proposed algorithm learns a nonlinear metric for KNN classification, overcoming the limitations of traditional metric learning algorithms which are only capable of learning linear transformations. Therefore, the proposed method is more flexible and powerful in transforming data than its linear counterpart.

A novel approach is developed to model perceived human observations to the real physical states using artificial neural networks (ANN). A particle filter (PF) is used to estimate a moving target's state based on range and bearing observation data from a human observer and an EKF is used to estimate the target state using on-board camera sensor. The range measurement is represented using Kumaraswamy's double bounded distribution. The state estimates computed based on a model of human observation learned by an ANN are fused with the state estimates from the on-board sensors using a fast covariance intersection (CI) algorithm. The CI algorithm yields consistent fused estimates in the absence of unknown correlations between state estimates obtained using human measurements and robot sensor measurements. The performance of the developed algorithms is validated on a target tracking simulation platform.","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2014.6974234","pdfPath":"/iel7/6960119/6973862/06974234.pdf","startPage":"2114","endPage":"2120","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2014.6974234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information fusion in human-robot collaboration using neural network representation","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974234/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Information fusion in human-robot collaboration using neural network representation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14790489","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6974234/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information fusion in human-robot collaboration using neural network representation","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2114ID1991.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088587S","chronDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6960119","isNumber":"6973862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6960119","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6973862","articleId":"6974234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6974263,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085534909"},{"name":"Feng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37073113700"},{"name":"Min Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Liu","id":"37653091600"},{"name":"Weiming Shen","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Weiming","lastName":"Shen","id":"37277735500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3840-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6974263","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":205},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974263","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Neural networks","Training","Prediction algorithms","Forecasting","Approximation algorithms","Function approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","failure analysis","fault diagnosis","function approximation","machinery","mechanical engineering computing","multi-agent systems","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["failure prediction method","neural network algorithm","back propagation neural network","multiagent cooperation grouping algorithm","BPNN training","fault forecasting","continuous casting equipment","failure prognosis","forecasting accuracy","function approximation","benchmark function","complex equipment","mechanical equipment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["complex equipment","failure prediction","multi-agent algorithm","back propagation neural network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SMC.2014.6974263","pdfPath":"/iel7/6960119/6973862/06974263.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","startPage":"2268","endPage":"2272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973862","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2014.6974263","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-agent based failure prediction method using neural network algorithm","abstract":"A continuous monitoring system with high reliability is significantly important for complex equipment which is usually expensive, large-scale and sophisticated. Once a failure happens, it brings about not only serious economic losses, but also potential security hazards. In order to overcome outage damage caused by temporary failure and ensure excellent operation of the equipment, this paper presented an effective prediction model which combined the back propagation neural network (BPNN) with multi-agent cooperation grouping algorithm. The values of weights and thresholds of BPNN were obtained through optimization results of the multi-agent cooperation grouping algorithm. Based on above initialization parameters which met corresponding demands, repeated BPNN training was utilized to forecast fault. Case study on continuous casting equipment validated that the proposed model is valid for failure prognosis with forecasting accuracy elevated, compared with classical BPNN prediction method. Another comparison, function approximation experiment on the basis of a benchmark function, also showed that the suggested method is superior to BPNN in convergence speed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974263/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14790334","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6974263/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A multi-agent based failure prediction method using neural network algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-agent based failure prediction method using neural network algorithm","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2268ID1119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045557S","chronDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6960119","isNumber":"6973862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6960119","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6973862","articleId":"6974263","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6974268,"authors":[{"name":"Lee-Min Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Dayeh University, Changhua, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Lee-Min","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085413138"},{"name":"Fu-Rong Jean","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Fu-Rong","lastName":"Jean","id":"37347389200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3840-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6974268","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Decoding","Speech recognition","Speech","Algorithm design and analysis","Accuracy","Viterbi algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","probability","recursive estimation","speech coding","speech recognition","time-varying systems","variable rate codes","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analysis-by-synthesis frame dropping algorithm","speech recognizer","time-varying hidden Markov model","distributed speech recognition applications","variable frame rate analysis","VFR analysis","channel bandwidth reduction","speech perception","AbS frame dropping algorithm","VFR decoding method","hidden Markov speech modeling","recursive formula","forward probability function","transition probabilities","Viterbi decoding algorithm","AbS-tvHMM method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speech recognition","hidden Markov model (HMM)","variable frame rate (VFR)","Viterbi algorithm","distributed speech recognition"]}],"abstract":"In distributed speech recognition applications, variable frame rate (VFR) analysis is a technique that can reduce the channel bandwidth and computation resources. In this method, slowly changing frames that provide little information are abandoned. Rapidly changing frames, on the other hand, that are more related to speech perception are preserved. In this paper, we proposed an analysis-by-synthesis (AbS) frame dropping algorithm together with a novel VFR decoding method for hidden Markov modeling of speech. A recursive formula for the calculation of forward probability function of the VFR observations was derived and was used to form a time-varying hidden Markov model (tvHMM) with transition probabilities that are depended on the time difference between successive observations. A generalized Viterbi decoding algorithm was developed to decode the VFR observations. We also use an example to explain the decoding process for a particular VFR observation sequence. Experiments were conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed AbS-tvHMM method. The experimental results show that our method can achieve essentially the same accuracy as full frame rate observations at frame rate of only 40 % and significantly reduces the computation time.","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2014.6974268","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6960119/6973862/06974268.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2014.6974268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973862","startPage":"2293","endPage":"2298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis-by-synthesis frame dropping algorithm together with a novel speech recognizer using time-varying hidden Markov model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974268","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis-by-synthesis frame dropping algorithm together with a novel speech recognizer using time-varying hidden Markov model","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974268/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14790105","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6974268/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis-by-synthesis frame dropping algorithm together with a novel speech recognizer using time-varying hidden Markov model","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2293ID1110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044481S","chronDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6960119","isNumber":"6973862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6960119","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6973862","articleId":"6974268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6974292,"authors":[{"name":"Kenya Jin'no","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nippon Institute of Technology Saitama, Miyashiro, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenya","lastName":"Jin'no","id":"37569328300"},{"name":"Takuya Shindo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nippon Institute of Technology Saitama, Miyashiro, Japan"],"firstName":"Takuya","lastName":"Shindo","id":"37719874300"},{"name":"Takuya Kurihara","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nippon Institute of Technology Saitama, Miyashiro, Japan"],"firstName":"Takuya","lastName":"Kurihara","id":"37713463400"},{"name":"Takefumi Hiraguri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nippon Institute of Technology Saitama, Miyashiro, Japan"],"firstName":"Takefumi","lastName":"Hiraguri","id":"37324619000"},{"name":"Hideaki Yoshino","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nippon Institute of Technology Saitama, Miyashiro, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideaki","lastName":"Yoshino","id":"37272978300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3840-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6974292","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Trajectory","Damping","Conferences","Heuristic algorithms","Numerical simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local search","rotation radius","rotational angle","damping factor","CD-PSO","global search","canonical deterministic particle swarm optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974292","abstract":"Particle swarm optimization is very simple algorithm. However, the trajectory of each particle becomes pretty complicated because each particle is affected by the information of the other particles.

The CD-PSO is described by a canonical form, and the dynamics is characterized by the damping factor and the rotational angle. The dynamics of the CD-PSO can be analyzed theoretically, however, the solution search performance is worse than the conventional PSO. The reason why the performance of the CD-PSO is poor, is the rotation radius of the particle is decreased with the change of the best position. The small rotation radius contributes to the local search ability, but the global search ability is spoiled. Therefore, we propose a method to sustain the global search for the CD-PSO. The function is realized by maintaining the rotation radius.

Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a low-cost, non-invasive, portable, and safe of handling imaging technique based on measuring the electric potentials generated by the application of currents in pairs of surface electrodes. Nevertheless, EIT image reconstruction is still an open problem, due to its nature as an ill-posed problem governed by the Equation of Poison. Several numerical methods are used in order to solve this equation without generating anatomically inconsistent results. Particle swarm algorithms can be used as alternatives to Gauss-Newton and Backprojection well-known approaches, which frequently generate low-resolution blurred images. Furthermore, Gauss-Newton convergence to anatomically consistent images is not guaranteed, needing to set constraints like the number of anatomical structures present on the image domain. Herein this work we present EIT reconstruction methods based on the optimization of the relative error of reconstruction using chaotic particle swarm algorithms with non-blind initial search. We studied two forms of initialization: totally random and including an imperfect but anatomically consistent noisy solution based on Gauss-Newton reconstruction method, according to Saha and Bandyopadhyay's criterion for non-blind initial search in optimization algorithms, in order to guide the iterative process to avoid anatomically inconsistent solutions and avoid convergence to local minima. Results were quantitatively evaluated with ground-truth images using the relative mean squared error, showing that our results reached low error magnitudes. Qualitative evaluation also indicated that our results were morphologically consistent, mainly for classical PSO and ring-topology PSO with non-blind initial search.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tomography","Particle swarm optimization","Electric potential","Image reconstruction","Impedance","Electrodes","Conductivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric potentials","electric impedance imaging","image reconstruction","mean square error methods","medical image processing","Newton method","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical impedance tomography image reconstruction","chaotic ring-topology particle swarm optimization","noninvasive imaging","e-health","diagnostic technology","nonionizing radiation","electric potentials","surface electrodes","EIT image reconstruction","nonblind initial search","anatomically consistent noisy solution","Gauss-Newton reconstruction method","Saha criterion","Bandyopadhyay criterion","iterative process","ground-truth images","relative mean squared error","error magnitudes","classical PSO","ring-topology PSO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["electrical impedance tomography","image reconstruction","reconstruction algorithms","particle swarm optimization","chaos"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973862","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2014.6974322","startPage":"2618","endPage":"2623","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6960119/6973862/06974322.pdf","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2014.6974322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction of electrical impedance tomography images using chaotic ring-topology particle swarm optimization and non-blind search","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction of electrical impedance tomography images using chaotic ring-topology particle swarm optimization and non-blind search","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14790512","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6974322/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974322/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction of electrical impedance tomography images using chaotic ring-topology particle swarm optimization and non-blind search","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2618ID1302.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126194S","chronDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6960119","isNumber":"6973862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6960119","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6973862","articleId":"6974322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":6974327,"authors":[{"name":"Naoya Takeishi","affiliation":["Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoya","lastName":"Takeishi","id":"37085440172"},{"name":"Takehisa Yairi","affiliation":["Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takehisa","lastName":"Yairi","id":"37270951700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3840-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6974327","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1369},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sparse matrices","Principal component analysis","Feature extraction","Correlation","Semantics","Time-domain analysis","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised instrumentation","data mining","fault diagnosis","matrix algebra","sensors","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multivariate time-series","sensor data","data mining application","time-domain correlations","generative signal models","semi-supervised anomaly detection","feature extraction","sparse representation","term-document matrix","sparse feature matrix"]}],"abstract":"Anomaly detection from sensor data is an important data mining application for efficient and secure operation of complicated systems. In this study, we propose a novel anomaly detection method for multivariate time-series to capture relationships of variables and time-domain correlations simultaneously, without assuming any generative models of signals. The supposed framework in this study is a semi-supervised anomaly detection where we seek unusual parts of test data compared with reference data. The proposed method is based on feature extraction with sparse representation and relationship learning with dimensionality reduction. Our idea comes from the similarity between a sparse feature matrix extracted from multivariate time-series and a term-document matrix. We conducted experiments with synthetic and simulated data, and confirmed that the proposed method successfully detected anomalies in multivariate time-series signals. Especially, it demonstrated superior performance with anomalies in which only relationships of time-series patterns are changed from reference data (multivariate anomalies).","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2014.6974327","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6960119/6973862/06974327.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2014.6974327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973862","startPage":"2651","endPage":"2656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly detection from multivariate time-series with sparse representation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974327","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly detection from multivariate time-series with sparse representation","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974327/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14790294","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6974327/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly detection from multivariate time-series with sparse representation","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2651ID1534.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077822S","chronDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6960119","isNumber":"6973862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6960119","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6973862","articleId":"6974327","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6974343,"authors":[{"name":"Francisco Serdio","affiliation":["Department of Knowledge-Based Mathematical Systems, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Francisco","lastName":"Serdio","id":"37085366529"},{"name":"Edwin Lughofer","affiliation":["Linz Center of Mechatronics (LCM), Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Edwin","lastName":"Lughofer","id":"37270778300"},{"name":"Kurt Pichler","affiliation":["Linz Center of Mechatronics (LCM), Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Kurt","lastName":"Pichler","id":"37698897500"},{"name":"Thomas Buchegger","affiliation":["Linz Center of Mechatronics (LCM), Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Buchegger","id":"37264962200"},{"name":"Markus Pichler","affiliation":["Linz Center of Mechatronics (LCM), Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Pichler","id":"37277215000"},{"name":"Hajrudin Efendic","affiliation":["The Institute for Design and Control of Mechatronical Systems, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Hajrudin","lastName":"Efendic","id":"38202146200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3840-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6974343","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing false positives for residual-based on-line fault detection by means of filters","abstract":"Departing from a previously demonstrated Residual-Based Fault-Detection system, where the residual signals are statistically tracked by means of tolerance bands, we introduce the use of filters as an intermediate step in the online operation of the system.

The research was performed with well-known existing filters, used in other domains such as engineering, image processing or econometrics.

Any arbitrary non-minimum phase channel may be approximated by the following three different types of channel: the moving-average (MA) channel, the autoregressive (AR) channel and the autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA) channel. The MA channel or the AR channel may be more effectively approximated by the ARMA channel with a much smaller total (numerator and denominator) number of coefficients.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a popular method for it. However, it cannot solve the path planning problem directly in unknown environment. In this paper, neural network (NN) is applied to estimate the unvisited space. The traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning is modified by the neural approximation. The path planning of this paper includes two stages: we first use RL to generate training samples for NN; then the trained NN gives an approximate action to agents. The advantage of this method is we do not need to repeat RL for the unvisited state.

To enable a diver to complete tasks safer and more efficiently, it is proposed that an Underwater Robotic Assistant (UWRA) could act as a robotic dive buddy. For example, the UWRA could ferry tools from the surface, carry scientific samples, and provide illumination in dark environments. However, one of the major hurdles to operating autonomous systems below the water's surface is that high-frequency radio signals are greatly attenuated by water. This severely limits the type of commands a diver can issue to the robot. Thus, one of the contributions of this paper is an analysis of the types of Underwater Human-Robot Communication (UHRC) that are possible between a diver and a UWRA. Following the analysis, we discuss implementation of a few of the proposed methods of UHRC where an underwater robot assists a diver during the installation of an underwater mechanical platform.","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2014.6974512","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6960119/6973862/06974512.pdf","startPage":"3738","endPage":"3743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2014.6974512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Underwater human-robot communication: A case study with human divers","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Underwater human-robot communication: A case study with human divers","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14790134","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6974512/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974512/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Underwater human-robot communication: A case study with human divers","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3738ID1552.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057354S","chronDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6960119","isNumber":"6973862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6960119","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6973862","articleId":"6974512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6974524,"authors":[{"name":"Julio Ju\u00e1rez","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education of Ensenada (CICESE), Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico"],"firstName":"Julio","lastName":"Ju\u00e1rez","id":"37085568002"},{"name":"Carlos Brizuela","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education of Ensenada (CICESE), Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Brizuela","id":"37265898400"},{"name":"Israel Mart\u00ednez","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education of Ensenada (CICESE), Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico"],"firstName":"Israel","lastName":"Mart\u00ednez","id":"37085568238"},{"name":"Karen Vel\u00e1zquez","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education of Ensenada (CICESE), Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico"],"firstName":"Karen","lastName":"Vel\u00e1zquez","id":"37085583923"},{"name":"Ema Lozano","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education of Ensenada (CICESE), Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico"],"firstName":"Ema","lastName":"Lozano","id":"37085577994"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3840-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6974524","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":204},"abstract":"Digital Microfluidic Biochips (DMFB) are revolutionizing clinical diagnostics and most of the biochemical processes that take place in a laboratory, mainly because of its capability for automation, low cost, portability, and efficiency. One important challenge in designing such devices is the droplet routing problem, which basically consists in mobilizing each droplet in the DMFB from its source to its target cells so that fluidic and timing constraints are met, while minimizing simultaneously the amount of cells used and the arrival time of the last droplet. In this paper, we propose a novel representation along with the corresponding genetic operators for the NSGA-II to deal with the droplet routing problem, where the number of used cells and the last droplet arrival time are optimized. Experimental results show that our representation and genetic operators lead to competitive results with respect to those obtained by state-of-the-art methods. To the best of the authors knowledge, this is the first time the droplet routing problem is dealt with an evolutionary algorithm approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6960119/6973862/06974524.pdf","startPage":"3808","endPage":"3815","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2014.6974524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2014.6974524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973862","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A genetic algorithm for the routing of droplets in DMFB: Preliminary results","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Arrays","Springs","Electrodes","Genetics","Genetic algorithms","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular biophysics","drops","genetic algorithms","lab-on-a-chip","medical computing","microfluidics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","droplet routing","DMFB","digital microfluidic biochips","NSGA-II","evolutionary algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital Microfluidic Biochips","Droplet Routing","Genetic Algorithms","NSGAII","Genetic Operators"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974524/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A genetic algorithm for the routing of droplets in DMFB: Preliminary results","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6974524/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14789948","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A genetic algorithm for the routing of droplets in DMFB: Preliminary results","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3808ID1911.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084521S","chronDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6960119","isNumber":"6973862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6960119","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6973862","articleId":"6974524","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6974533,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi-Yuan Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung-Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Zhi-Yuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085570651"},{"name":"Chia-Feng Juang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung-Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Chia-Feng","lastName":"Juang","id":"37271874000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3840-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6974533","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":258},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974533","abstract":"This paper proposes hexapod robot locomotion control using a fuzzy controller (FC) learned through particle swarm optimization (PSO).

This paper proposes locomotion control of the hexapod robot using an FC for applications in different environments. Given the robot state, the FC controls the robot orientation by changing the swing amplitude of the middle leg on each side of the robot. As to the design of the FC, all of the free parameters in which are learned through PSO, which avoids the time-consuming manual design task. The proposed PSO-based FC approach is applied to two hexapod robot locomotion control problems: obstacle boundary-following control and circle-following control. Simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the locomotion control approach.","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2014.6974533","startPage":"3861","endPage":"3866","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6960119/6973862/06974533.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2014.6974533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolutionary locomotion control of a hexapod robot using particle swarm optimized fuzzy controller","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot kinematics","Legged locomotion","Trajectory","Training","Robot sensing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","evolutionary computation","finite state machines","fuzzy control","legged locomotion","motion control","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary locomotion control","particle swarm optimisation","fuzzy controller","hexapod robot locomotion control","finite state machine","swing amplitude","robot orientation","PSO-based FC approach","obstacle boundary-following control","circle-following control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fuzzy controller","particle swarm optimization","hexapod robot control","obstacle boundary-following control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974533/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Evolutionary locomotion control of a hexapod robot using particle swarm optimized fuzzy controller","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6974533/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14790037","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolutionary locomotion control of a hexapod robot using particle swarm optimized fuzzy controller","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3861ID1161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081541S","chronDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6960119","isNumber":"6973862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6960119","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6973862","articleId":"6974533","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6974550,"authors":[{"name":"Samuel M.

The fitting accuracy was compared to that of non-individualized shells by applying an 8 kg weight onto the worn shells.

A human will often have knowledge of global objectives and high-level plans, but the collective will often have more detailed lower-level knowledge about the particulars of the situation at hand. Thus it is important to understand how control can be appropriately shared between the human and the collective. We analyze human interaction with bio-inspired collectives using graph theory, and propose that there are two human-side elements that determine how well control is shared: span and persistence. We additionally propose that there is a collective-side element that determines how well control is shared: connectivity. We study two examples of shared-control between a human and a bio-inspired collective: shaping a spatial formation and causing a collective to switch between stable collective states. Our empirical results show that span, persistence, and connectivity combine to affect (1) how influence is shared between the human and the collective and (2) the resulting success of human-collective interactions.","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2014.6974582","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6960119/6973862/06974582.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2014.6974582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973862","startPage":"4123","endPage":"4128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Balancing human and inter-agent influences for shared control of bio-inspired collectives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974582","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Balancing human and inter-agent influences for shared control of bio-inspired collectives","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974582/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14790515","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6974582/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Balancing human and inter-agent influences for shared control of bio-inspired collectives","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4123ID1572.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056293S","chronDate":"5-8 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6960119","isNumber":"6973862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6960119","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6973862","articleId":"6974582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6974610,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammadreza Mesbahi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammadreza","lastName":"Mesbahi","id":"37085589855"},{"name":"Amir Masoud Rahmani","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Amir Masoud","lastName":"Rahmani","id":"37313847700"},{"name":"Anthony Theodore Chronopoulos","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Anthony Theodore","lastName":"Chronopoulos","id":"37274571100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5460-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6870-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5461-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6974610","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":497},"abstract":"Load balancing is one of the central issues and challenges in cloud computing environments.

This inter-application interference degrades overall system performance and unfairly slows down applications. Prior works have developed application-aware memory request schedulers to tackle this problem. State-of-the-art application-aware memory request schedulers prioritize memory requests of applications that are vulnerable to interference, by ranking individual applications based on their memory access characteristics and enforcing a total rank order. In this paper, we observe that state-of-the-art application-aware memory schedulers have two major shortcomings. First, ranking applications individually with a total order based on memory access characteristics leads to high hardware cost and complexity. Second, ranking can unfairly slow down applications that are at the bottom of the ranking stack. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose the Blacklisting Memory Scheduler (BLISS), which achieves high system performance and fairness while incurring low hardware cost and complexity. BLISS design is based on two new observations. First, we find that, to mitigate interference, it is sufficient to separate applications into only two groups, one containing applications that cause interference and another containing applications vulnerable to interference, instead of ranking individual applications with a total order. Vulnerable-to-interference group is prioritized over the interference-causing group. Second, we show that this grouping can be efficiently performed by simply counting the number of consecutive requests served from each application - an application that has a large number of consecutive requests served is dynamically classified as interference-causing. We evaluate BLISS across a wide variety of workloads and system configurations and compare its performance and complexity with five state-of-the-art memory schedulers. Our evaluations show that BLISS achieves 5% better system performance and 25% better fairness than the best-performing previous memory scheduler while greatly reducing critical path latency and hardware area cost of the memory scheduler (by 79% and 43%, respectively).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Blacklisting Memory Scheduler: Achieving high performance and fairness at low cost","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974655","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6964907/6974646/06974655.pdf","startPage":"8","endPage":"15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6974646","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974655","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"The Blacklisting Memory Scheduler: Achieving high performance and fairness at low cost","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6974655/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14791882","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Blacklisting Memory Scheduler: Achieving high performance and fairness at low cost","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076836S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6964907","isNumber":"6974646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6964907","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6974646","articleId":"6974655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6974656,"authors":[{"name":"Mengying Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Mengying","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38466615000"},{"name":"Liang Shi","affiliation":["Chongqing University, Chongqing, Sichuan, CN"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Shi"},{"name":"Chengmo Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, US"],"firstName":"Chengmo","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085368335"},{"name":"Chun Jason Xue","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Chun Jason","lastName":"Xue","id":"37265504000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6492-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"6974656","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":450},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leveling to the last mile: Near-zero-cost bit level wear leveling for PCM-based main memory","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6964907/6974646/06974656.pdf","startPage":"16","endPage":"21","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6974646","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974656","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase change materials","Radiation detectors","Registers","Benchmark testing","Educational institutions","Random access memory","Round robin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","phase change memories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy overhead","write distributions","memory hierarchy","near-zero leakage power","DRAM","PCM endurance enhancement","PCM based main memory","phase change memory","near-zero-cost bit-level wear leveling strategy"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974656","abstract":"Phase change memory (PCM) has demonstrated great potential as an alternative of DRAM to serve as main memory due to its favorable characteristics of non-volatility, scalability and near-zero leakage power. However, the comparatively poor endurance of PCM largely limits its adoption. Wear leveling strategies targeting to even write distributions have been proposed at different granularities and on various memory hierarchies for PCM endurance enhancement. Write operations are distributed across the memory through migrating data from heavily written locations to less burdened ones, which is usually guided by counters recording the number of writes. However, evenly distributing writes at a coarse granularity cannot deliver the best endurance results as write distributions are highly imbalanced even at the bit level. In this work, we propose a near-zero-cost bit-level wear leveling strategy to improve PCM endurance. The proposed technique can be combined with various coarse-grained wear leveling strategies.

With DRAM scaling towards sub-20nm process technology, we expect a significant portion of DRAM cells become weak cells and require a higher refresh rate, resulting in even higher refresh overhead. A possible solution is to selectively refresh those weak cells using a higher frequency but still refresh the majority at the nominal rate. However, how to provide a multi-rate DRAM refresh scheme is not straightforward. Previous work on this topic was built on an obsolete refresh framework and was incompatible to modern DRAM standards, making it challenging to be adopted in practice. In this work, we propose ProactiveDRAM, a novel scheme that allows DRAM proactively guides the timing of weak cell refresh management and reuses memory controllers' capability in command scheduling. ProactiveDRAM offers a smart retention-aware refresh on the DRAM row granularity, and more importantly, it can be built atop any modern DRAM architecture. Our simulation results show that ProactiveDRAM can handle 1% (or even 10%) weak row population with negligible performance and energy overhead1.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974657","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974657","startPage":"22","endPage":"27","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6964907/6974646/06974657.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6974646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ProactiveDRAM: A DRAM-initiated retention management scheme","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974657/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"ProactiveDRAM: A DRAM-initiated retention management scheme","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14791913","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6974657/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ProactiveDRAM: A DRAM-initiated retention management scheme","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076777S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6964907","isNumber":"6974646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6964907","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6974646","articleId":"6974657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6974658,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wei","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Scieneces, Beijing, China","Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Computing Technology"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wei","id":"37085469485"},{"name":"Dejun Jiang","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Computing Technology"],"firstName":"Dejun","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085391358"},{"name":"Jin Xiong","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Computing Technology"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Xiong","id":"38494619400"},{"name":"Mingyu Chen","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Computing Technology"],"firstName":"Mingyu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37407023400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6492-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"6974658","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":698},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonvolatile memory","Random access memory","Radiation detectors","Measurement","Servers","Memory management","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","DRAM chips","memory architecture","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HAP","hybrid memory aware cache partitioning technique","TMPKI","LLC policies","shared last level cache","cache miss","NVM","nonvolatile memories","DRAM","data-center servers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974658","abstract":"Data-center servers require large capacity main memory to run multiple workloads simultaneously. However, the scalability and power consumption of DRAM limit its capability of constructing large capacity memory. Emerging non-volatile memories (e.g. PCM and STT-RAM) provide better scalability and lower power leakage than DRAM. Especially, hybrid memory consisting of DRAM and NVM is able to exploit advantages of different memory medias. However, NVMs have a few drawbacks, such as relatively longer read and write latency. Cache miss at the shared last level cache (LLC) suffers from longer latency if the missing data resides in NVM. Current LLC policies manage the cache space without being aware of the underlying heterogeneous medias. This results in cache performance degradation if a large number of missing data come from NVM. Taking the asymmetric cache miss cost into account, we first propose a new performance metric -TMPKI, which can exactly reflect the LLC performance on the top of hybrid memories. Then we propose a hybrid memory aware cache partitioning technique (HAP) to dynamically adjust the cache spaces for DRAM and NVM data based on TMPKI. Experimental results show that HAP improves performance against the traditional LRU policy by up to 54.3% (19.6% on average) while it incurs a little storage overhead (0.2%).","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6974646","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6964907/6974646/06974658.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974658","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974658","startPage":"28","endPage":"35","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HAP: Hybrid-memory-Aware Partition in shared Last-Level Cache","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974658/","displayDocTitle":"HAP: Hybrid-memory-Aware Partition in shared Last-Level Cache","htmlLink":"/document/6974658/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14791895","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HAP: Hybrid-memory-Aware Partition in shared Last-Level Cache","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07241S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6964907","isNumber":"6974646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6964907","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6974646","articleId":"6974658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6974659,"authors":[{"name":"Manish Rana","affiliation":["Department Arquitectura de Computadors, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Manish","lastName":"Rana","id":"37085562234"},{"name":"Ramon Canal","affiliation":["Department Arquitectura de Computadors, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Ramon","lastName":"Canal","id":"37391750000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6492-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"6974659","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","Random access memory","Computational modeling","Mathematical model","Estimation","Accuracy","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["failure analysis","importance sampling","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit yield","Markov processes","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["REEM","failure-nonfailure region estimation method","SRAM yield analysis","resilient memory design","memory yield estimation","Markov chain Monte Carlo method","MCMC method","importance sampling method","failure point","SRAM parameter","region estimation-by-exploiting monotonicity","SRAM failure monotonicity property"]}],"abstract":"The big challenge that we face today for designing resilient memories is the huge number of simulations needed to arrive at a good estimate of memory's yield. A lot of work has come up recently focusing on the reduction of these simulations. The majority of these methods have focused on using different Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, most notably Importance Sampling. SRAMs, though, have an interesting property of failure monotonicity which implies that given a known failure point in SRAM's parameter space all points with larger variations will also be failure points. Our work REEM (Region Estimation by Exploiting Monotonicity), thus, focuses on exploiting the SRAM's failure monotonicity property for faster estimation of the Failure/Non-Failure regions. The usual MCMC methods can then be used without needing actual spice simulations. Our results show that using our method we can achieve an overall 10\u00d7 reduction in simulations compared to traditional Importance Sampling methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"REEM: Failure/non-failure region estimation method for SRAM yield analysis","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974659","startPage":"36","endPage":"41","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6974646","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6964907/6974646/06974659.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974659","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974659/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"REEM: Failure/non-failure region estimation method for SRAM yield analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6974659/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14791903","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"REEM: Failure/non-failure region estimation method for SRAM yield analysis","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056363S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6964907","isNumber":"6974646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6964907","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6974646","articleId":"6974659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6974661,"authors":[{"name":"Hang Zhang","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37072454500"},{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085533355"},{"name":"John Lach","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Lach","id":"37274887900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6492-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"6974661","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":585},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974661","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","Benchmark testing","Piecewise linear approximation","Graphics processing units","Error analysis","Linear approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","floating point arithmetic","low-power electronics","multiplying circuits","SPICE"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power accuracy-configurable floating point multiplier","IEEE-754 standard floating point multiplier","floating point multiplication","embedded systems","Mitchell algorithm","post-layout SPICE simulations","size 45 nm"]}],"abstract":"Floating point multiplication is one of the most frequently used arithmetic operations in a wide variety of applications, but the high power consumption of the IEEE-754 standard floating point multiplier prohibits its implementation in many low power systems, such as wireless sensors and other battery-powered embedded systems, and limits performance scaling in high performance systems, such as CPUs and GPGPUs for scientific computation.

Their fault-tolerance behavior, however, is not yet fully explored. In particular, temporal masking, as seen with synchronous circuits, seems to be completely non-existent in asynchronous logic. Instead, there seem to be other masking mechanisms in the control structure that establish an extra barrier for transient fault propagation. In this paper we will explore these masking mechanisms in a qualitative as well as quantitative manner. To this end we first analyze the behavior of a Muller C-element, one fundamental building block in asynchronous designs. In a next step we evaluate the behavior of a chain of these elements, forming a so-called Muller pipeline, the basic control structure of many asynchronous designs, under transient faults. To validate our theoretical findings we inject radiation induced single event transients (SETs) in an extensive simulation campaign. The results show that the SET susceptibility of the Muller pipeline is indeed state dependent. This knowledge can be leveraged to improve, e.g., the radiation hardness of asynchronous circuits by preferring the more robust states in their design wherever possible.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974663/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6974663/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14791908","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Exploring the state dependent SET sensitivity of asynchronous logic - The muller-pipeline example","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring the state dependent SET sensitivity of asynchronous logic - The muller-pipeline example","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060481S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6964907","isNumber":"6974646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6964907","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6974646","articleId":"6974663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6974666,"authors":[{"name":"Seokin Hong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Seokin","lastName":"Hong","id":"37597659100"},{"name":"Jongmin Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Jongmin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37964873200"},{"name":"Soontae Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Soontae","lastName":"Kim","id":"38183925200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6492-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"6974666","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":603},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974666","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resistance","Switches","Magnetic tunneling","Reliability","Error analysis","Magnetic domains","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","random-access storage","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ternary cache","MLC STT-RAM cache","spin-transfer torque random access memory","nonvolatile memory technology","cache memory","multilevel cell","cache design","memory cell","read stability","MLC STT-RAM-based cache","writability","write operation","data density benefit","reliability benefit"]}],"abstract":"Spin-transfer torque random access memory (STT-RAM) has become a promising non-volatile memory technology for cache memories. Recently, 2-bit multi-level cell (MLC) STT-RAM has been proposed to enhance data density, but it suffers from low reliability of its read and write operations. In this paper, we propose a novel cache design called Ternary cache. In Ternary cache, a memory cell can store three values (i.e., 0,1,2) while MLC STT-RAM can store four values. In this way, Ternary cache achieves much higher read stability than MLC STT-RAM-based caches. To enhance writability, a write operation is performed with high current and terminated as soon as the data is written. Evaluation results show that Ternary cache achieves the data density benefit of MLC STT-RAM and the reliability benefit of SLC STT-RAM.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6974646","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974666","endPage":"89","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6964907/6974646/06974666.pdf","startPage":"83","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ternary cache: Three-valued MLC STT-RAM caches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974666/","displayDocTitle":"Ternary cache: Three-valued MLC STT-RAM caches","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14791854","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6974666/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ternary cache: Three-valued MLC STT-RAM caches","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077731S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6964907","isNumber":"6974646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6964907","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6974646","articleId":"6974666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6974668,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongdong Qi","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhongdong","lastName":"Qi","id":"38067501700"},{"name":"Yici Cai","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yici","lastName":"Cai","id":"37277094600"},{"name":"Qiang Zhou","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37274718000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6492-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"6974668","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1241},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Data models","Pins","Training","Shape","Predictive models","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic engineering computing","integrated circuit design","learning (artificial intelligence)","network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["detailed routing congestion prediction","supervised data learning","routing congestion model","nonparametric regression technique","machine learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974668","abstract":"Routing congestion model is of great importance in design stages of modern physical synthesis, e.g. global routing and routability estimation during placement.

It is expected that MLC STT-RAM can achieve 2\u00d7 the storage density of SLC and thus improves system performance. Unfortunately, at the device level, the two-step read/write scheme introduces performance and energy overhead. In this paper, we propose an architectural design to dynamically reconfigure the cache block size for a MLC STT-RAM last-level cache. Our approach place certain hot data chunks in smaller blocks so as to benefit from the lower latency and energy, while keeping the rest in larger blocks to maintain an overall hit rate. Experiment shows that our strategy reduces the performance and energy penalty of MLC STT-RAM caches with a slightly higher miss rate. On average, IPC is increased by 4.6% while energy consumption is reduced by 23.5% compared to the conventional MLC STT-RAM cache.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974672","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6964907/6974646/06974672.pdf","startPage":"133","endPage":"138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6974646","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing MLC-based STT-RAM caches by dynamic block size reconfiguration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974672/","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing MLC-based STT-RAM caches by dynamic block size reconfiguration","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6974672/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14791872","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing MLC-based STT-RAM caches by dynamic block size reconfiguration","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055117S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6964907","isNumber":"6974646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6964907","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6974646","articleId":"6974672","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6974673,"authors":[{"name":"Juan-Antonio Carballo","affiliation":["Broadcom Ltd Irvine, Irvine, CA, US"],"firstName":"Juan-Antonio","lastName":"Carballo"},{"name":"Wei-Ting Jonas Chan","affiliation":["ECE"],"firstName":"Wei-Ting Jonas","lastName":"Chan","id":"37085406425"},{"name":"Paolo A.

In this paper, we describe several fundamental changes in the ITRS MPU and SOC system driver models as of the recently-released 2013 edition of the roadmap. We first present new A-factor (i.e., layout density) models for the logic and memory components of the MPU and SOC drivers; these updated density models comprehend the industry's shift to FinFET devices below the foundry 20nm node. We also describe updated architectural, total chip area, and total chip power models for the MPU and SOC drivers. Notably, we model the growing uncore portion of MPU products, and the growing presence of graphic processing units (GPUs) and other peripheral cores (PEs) in SOC architectures. The updated SOC architectural model enables more realistic scenario-based power modeling for the SOC driver. The 2013 ITRS update of system driver models embodies extensive calibration with foundry data as well as product structural analysis reports from a leading analysis firm (Chipworks). The model calibration reveals that the industry has contended with a \u201cscaling gap\u201d since 2008, whereby traditional Moore's-Law density scaling of 2\u00d7 per node has failed due to patterning limitations on layout design, as well as manufacturability and performability challenges of Metal-1 half-pitch (M1HP) scaling. Growing design margins due to reliability, yield, variability, etc. have also contributed to the slowdown of density scaling. We describe how this scaling gap can potentially be compensated if the semiconductor industry urgently pursues design-based equivalent scaling (DES), which substantially changes the area and power model trajectories of MPUs and SOCs in the ITRS System Drivers Chapter. Finally, we note that as a consequence of the updated A-factor, area and power models in the 2013 ITRS, the industry now faces a 20% more daunting power management challenge than had been predicted in the 2011 roadmap.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The ITRS MPU and SOC system drivers: Calibration and implications for design-based equivalent scaling in the roadmap","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974675","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6964907/6974646/06974675.pdf","startPage":"153","endPage":"160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6974646","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974675","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974675/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"The ITRS MPU and SOC system drivers: Calibration and implications for design-based equivalent scaling in the roadmap","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6974675/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14806048","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The ITRS MPU and SOC system drivers: Calibration and implications for design-based equivalent scaling in the roadmap","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060791S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6964907","isNumber":"6974646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6964907","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6974646","articleId":"6974675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6974676,"authors":[{"name":"Gary Smith","affiliation":["Gary Smith EDA, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Gary","lastName":"Smith","id":"37061042500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6492-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"6974676","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":545},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software","Hardware","Productivity","Technological innovation","Transistors","Integrated circuits","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["costing","integrated circuit design","low-power electronics","semiconductor industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ITRS design cost","power models","integrated functions","overall design complexity","design cost control","design productivity","International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors","electronic design automation","internal CAD organization","design cost model","nonideal scaling","design technology solutions","energy challenge"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974676","abstract":"Design cost and power/energy have been major challenges for the semiconductor industry over the past decade or more.

To account for possible errors, each page in a flash memory is equipped with an Error Correction Code (ECC) module. An ECC scheme is chosen according to the worst-case error occurrences across all pages in the flash memory. Recent studies show that an MLC flash cell in different states exhibits diverse error rates and the difference is dramatic. Consequently, pages with different data will exhibit quite different error rates. Existing technologies that use one uniform ECC scheme for all pages in a flash memory is far from optimal. This paper exploits the asymmetric error rates exhibited by the pages with different data for write performance improvement. Before a page is programmed, its specific error rate, called Content-Dependent Bit Error Rate (CDBER), is estimated according to the content of the page. The margin between the CDBER of a page and the maximal error rate correctable by the uniform ECC code is exploited for write performance improvement. Simulation results show that the proposed approach leads to significant write performance improvement.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974682","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6964907/6974646/06974682.pdf","startPage":"202","endPage":"207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974682","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6974646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploit asymmetric error rates of cell states to improve the performance of flash memory storage systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974682","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974682/","displayDocTitle":"Exploit asymmetric error rates of cell states to improve the performance of flash memory storage systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14791892","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6974682/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploit asymmetric error rates of cell states to improve the performance of flash memory storage systems","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117596S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6964907","isNumber":"6974646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6964907","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6974646","articleId":"6974682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6974684,"authors":[{"name":"Youyou Lu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Youyou","lastName":"Lu","id":"37406514500"},{"name":"Jiwu Shu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Computing Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiwu","lastName":"Shu","id":"37272618000"},{"name":"Long Sun","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085335995"},{"name":"Onur Mutlu","affiliation":["Computer Architecture Laboratory, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Onur","lastName":"Mutlu","id":"37265510200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6492-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"6974684","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":77,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Memory management","Computer crashes","Software","Hardware","Random access memory","Nonvolatile memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["meta data","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["loose-ordering consistency","NVM technologies","nonvolatile memory technologies","LOC","main memory level","access speeds","CPU caches","persistent memory writes","eager commit","persistent commit record write","metadata information","speculative persistence","speculative write","associated transaction commits","transaction ID","multiversioning"]}],"abstract":"Emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies enable data persistence at the main memory level at access speeds close to DRAM. In such persistent memories, memory writes need to be performed in strict order to satisfy storage consistency requirements and enable correct recovery from system crashes. Unfortunately, adhering to a strict order for writes to persistent memory significantly degrades system performance as it requires flushing dirty data blocks from CPU caches and waiting for their completion at the main memory in the order specified by the program. This paper introduces a new mechanism, called Loose-Ordering Consistency (LOC), that satisfies the ordering requirements of persistent memory writes at significantly lower performance degradation than state-of-the-art mechanisms. LOC consists of two key techniques. First, Eager Commit reduces the commit overhead for writes within a transaction by eliminating the need to perform a persistent commit record write at the end of a transaction. We do so by ensuring that we can determine the status of all committed transactions during recovery by storing necessary metadata information statically with blocks of data written to memory. Second, Speculative Persistence relaxes the ordering of writes between transactions by allowing writes to be speculatively written to persistent memory. A speculative write is made visible to software only after its associated transaction commits. To enable this, our mechanism requires the tracking of committed transaction ID and support for multi-versioning in the CPU cache. Our evaluations show that LOC reduces the average performance overhead of strict write ordering from 66.9% to 34.9% on a variety of workloads.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974684","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6964907/6974646/06974684.pdf","startPage":"216","endPage":"223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6974646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Loose-Ordering Consistency for persistent memory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974684","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974684/","displayDocTitle":"Loose-Ordering Consistency for persistent memory","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14791868","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6974684/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Loose-Ordering Consistency for persistent memory","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.127509S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6964907","isNumber":"6974646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6964907","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"6974646","articleId":"6974684","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6974691,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085352215"},{"name":"Chengmo Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE"],"firstName":"Chengmo","lastName":"Yang","id":"37597788000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6492-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"6974691","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":317},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974691","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","Resistance","Phase change materials","Writing","Equations","Error analysis","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase change memories","quantisation (signal)","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantization error rate","time-aware writing scheme","interlevel quantization margin","write strategy","cell quantization accuracy","MLC PCM reliability","PCM writing","intercell variations","quantization method","quantization thresholds","cell writing","cell reading","SLC PCM","single level cell PCM","multilevel cell PCM","main memory storage","phase change memory"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974691","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6964907/6974646/06974691.pdf","startPage":"264","endPage":"269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6974646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving multilevel PCM reliability through age-aware reading and writing strategies","abstract":"Given its low power consumption and high density, Phase Change Memory (PCM) has been treated as a promising alternative to DRAM for main memory storage. Multilevel Cell (MLC) PCM outperforms regular single level cell (SLC) PCM with even higher information density, yet requires more accurate control for cell reading and writing. More crucially, the resistance of a MLC PCM cell may drift over time, thus introducing high error rate during cell reading if the quantization thresholds are constant. While previous work tries to adjust the quantization method when reading a cell, its accuracy is still limited due to the inter-cell variations in data age. In this paper, we propose various PCM writing and quantization strategies to improve MLC PCM reliability. Cell quantization accuracy is improved by taking into consideration not only the time information but also inter-cell age variations. Moreover, by making the write strategy be aware of time, the inter-level quantization margin can be guaranteed when the cells exhibit large age variations. This time-aware writing scheme is adaptively applied to maximize achievable benefits. The experimental results show that the proposed writing and reading approaches can effectively reduce the quantization error rate in MLC PCM by 95%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974691/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6974691/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14791867","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Improving multilevel PCM reliability through age-aware reading and writing strategies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving multilevel PCM reliability through age-aware reading and writing strategies","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p264.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071219S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6964907","isNumber":"6974646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6964907","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6974646","articleId":"6974691","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6974704,"authors":[{"name":"Daming Zhang","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Daming","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37537299100"},{"name":"Shuangchen Li","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shuangchen","lastName":"Li","id":"37537866000"},{"name":"Ang Li","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ang","lastName":"Li","id":"37085343370"},{"name":"Yongpan Liu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yongpan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292036600"},{"name":"X.

In this paper, we discuss a design of compact and accurate stochastic circuits. Stochastic circuits are known as a way to stochastically compute complex calculation at low hardware cost, while stochastic number generators (SNGs), which are used for converting deterministic numbers into stochastic numbers, account for a large fraction of the circuits. To reduce such SNGs in stochastic circuits, we propose a technique to share random number generators with several SNGs. This sharing method employs circular shift of the output of LFSRs to reduce the correlation between stochastic numbers. We also discuss the influence of input correlation around a multiplexer, which is a scaled adder for stochastic computing, so as to avoid over reducing the input correlation. Application of the proposed techniques to two stochastic image processing shows the reduction in the size of SNGs without greatly sacrificing accuracy.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6974646","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974706","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6964907/6974646/06974706.pdf","startPage":"361","endPage":"366","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974706","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact and accurate stochastic circuits with shared random number sources","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Compact and accurate stochastic circuits with shared random number sources","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6974706/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14791879","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974706/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact and accurate stochastic circuits with shared random number sources","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p361.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072221S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6964907","isNumber":"6974646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6964907","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6974646","articleId":"6974706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6974707,"authors":[{"name":"Te-Hsuan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Te-Hsuan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37070559600"},{"name":"John P.

Arithmetic operations can be implemented at very low cost by means of SC. To achieve acceptable accuracy, interacting SNs must usually be statistically independent or uncorrelated. Correlation is poorly understood, however, and is a key problem in SC because of its impact on accuracy and the high cost of correlation-reducing logic. In this paper we analyze and quantify the role of correlation in stochastic circuit design. We use an algebraic framework based on probabilistic transfer matrices (PTMs) to analyze correlation-induced errors. We compare two systematic correlation-reducing methods, regeneration and isolation. Regeneration introduces new (pseudo) random sources to re-randomize SNs, while isolation uses delays (D flip-flops) to derive multiple independent SNs from a single random source. We present bounds on accuracy loss due to isolator insertion and compare its hardware cost to that of regeneration. We conclude that the isolation method can offer significant cost advantages in reducing correlation errors.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974707","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6964907/6974646/06974707.pdf","startPage":"367","endPage":"373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974707","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6974646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analyzing and controlling accuracy in stochastic circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analyzing and controlling accuracy in stochastic circuits","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14791873","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6974707/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974707/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing and controlling accuracy in stochastic circuits","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p367.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100006S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6964907","isNumber":"6974646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6964907","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6974646","articleId":"6974707","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6974708,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Shafaei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Shafaei","id":"37594635400"},{"name":"Yanzhi Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA"],"firstName":"Yanzhi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37966617700"},{"name":"Massoud Pedram","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA"],"firstName":"Massoud","lastName":"Pedram","id":"37278158100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6492-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"6974708","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":479},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974708","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["FinFETs","CMOS integrated circuits","Silicon","Hafnium","Magnetic tunneling","Layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","integrated circuit layout","MOSFET","MRAM devices","torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low write-energy STT-MRAM","large access transistors","spin-transfer torque magnetic RAM technology","MOS-accessed cells","FinFET device design","higher ON current","denser layout area","planar CMOS transistors","energy-efficient STT-MRAM cell design","optimal layout-related parameters","MTJ","cell area minimization","detailed cell-architecture-level comparisons","write pulse width"]}],"abstract":"Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic RAM (STT-MRAM) technology requires a high current in order to write data into memory cells, which gives rise to large access transistors in conventional MOS-accessed cells.

It has been reported that the NoC consumes about a third of the total power consumption of the multi-core processor. To address this, asynchronous NoC routers have been proposed, to eliminate the clocking power associated with the NoC implementation, which is typically a large fraction of the NoC power consumption. In this work, we present a technique to reduce the standby power of a state-of-the-art asynchronous NoC router. In our approach, the router is put in a known input state when idle, and each gate in the unmodified router is replaced by a logically equivalent gate whose supply pin is connected to a PMOS device with a high threshold voltage in case its output in the idle state was 0. On the other hand, if the output of the unmodified gate in the idle state was 1, it is replaced by a logically equivalent gate whose ground terminal is connected to a NMOS device with a high threshold voltage. Our router is inserted in a NoC, and verified logically for correct routing functionality. We also simulated it at the circuit level using a 45nm fabrication technology, and show that it has a low wake-up time from sleep, and a minimal steady-state routing delay (13%) and area (23%) overhead, and a 8.1\u00d7 lower standby power, when compared to an unmodified asynchronous NoC router, which was also implemented. Our leakage improvement is achieved in part by using a novel method to control the leakage of the inverter chain used to drive the sleep signal, something which that is not possible with traditional leakage reduction techniques.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974711","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6964907/6974646/06974711.pdf","startPage":"394","endPage":"399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6974646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An asynchronous Network-on-Chip router with low standby power","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An asynchronous Network-on-Chip router with low standby power","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14791859","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6974711/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974711/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An asynchronous Network-on-Chip router with low standby power","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p394.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077977S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6964907","isNumber":"6974646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6964907","xplore-issue":"6974646","articleId":"6974711","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6974716,"authors":[{"name":"Yaman Umuroglu","affiliation":["Norges teknisk-naturvitenskapelige universitet, Trondheim, NO"],"firstName":"Yaman","lastName":"Umuroglu"},{"name":"Magnus Jahre","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Magnus","lastName":"Jahre","id":"37570065200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6492-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"6974716","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":414},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Random access memory","Vectors","Field programmable gate arrays","Sparse matrices","Kernel","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","energy conservation","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM power efficiency","datapath optimizations","sparse matrix-vector multiplication","energy efficient acceleration","FPGA SpMV accelerators","energy efficient column-major backend"]}],"abstract":"FPGAs are promising candidates for energy efficient acceleration of sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV), a kernel with important applications in scientific computing and engineering. SpMV is characterized by matrix-dependent performance and high external memory bandwidth demands, which makes bandwidth utilization an important performance indicator. Existing FPGA SpMV accelerators focus on datapath optimizations instead of memory behavior, and exhibit matrix-dependent bandwidth utilization. In this work, we propose to decouple the SpMV computation and memory behavior, and focus on the backend which handles the latter. We describe a scalable backend architecture that exploits column-major traversal and interleaving to achieve high bandwidth utilization. Our experiments show that a single backend is able to sustain 96% of its assigned memory port bandwidth on average, and scales well with increased bandwidth by instantiating multiple parallel units. Compared to a baseline scheme, our scheme offers up to 1.5\u00d7 higher DRAM power efficiency and up to 20% higher aggregate bandwidth. The results indicate that our scheme improves the average bandwidth utilization of existing FPGA SpMV accelerators by 15 to 77%.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An energy efficient column-major backend for FPGA SpMV accelerators","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974716","startPage":"432","endPage":"439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6974646","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6964907/6974646/06974716.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974716","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974716/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"An energy efficient column-major backend for FPGA SpMV accelerators","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6974716/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14806045","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An energy efficient column-major backend for FPGA SpMV accelerators","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p432.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058038S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6964907","isNumber":"6974646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6964907","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6974646","articleId":"6974716","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6974719,"authors":[{"name":"Guanwen Zhong","affiliation":["School of Computing, National University of Singapore"],"firstName":"Guanwen","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37085396845"},{"name":"Vanchinathan Venkataramani","affiliation":["School of Computing, National University of Singapore"],"firstName":"Vanchinathan","lastName":"Venkataramani","id":"37071701900"},{"name":"Yun Liang","affiliation":["Center for Energy-Efficient Computing and Applications, Peking University, China"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Liang","id":"37085384391"},{"name":"Tulika Mitra","affiliation":["School of Computing, National University of Singapore"],"firstName":"Tulika","lastName":"Mitra","id":"37282510200"},{"name":"Smail Niar","affiliation":["LAMIH, University of Valenciennes, France"],"firstName":"Smail","lastName":"Niar","id":"37298902900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6492-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"6974719","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":611},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design space exploration of multiple loops on FPGAs using high level synthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974719","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Algorithm design and analysis","Space exploration","Field programmable gate arrays","Prediction algorithms","Optimization","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","high level synthesis","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","image processing","signal processing","high-level synthesis","high-level programming languages","Pareto-optimal curve"]}],"abstract":"Real-world applications such as image processing, signal processing, and others often contain a sequence of computation intensive kernels, each represented in the form of a nested loop. High-level synthesis (HLS) enables efficient hardware implementation of these loops using high-level programming languages. HLS tools also allow the designers to evaluate design choices with different trade-offs through pragmas/directives. Prior design space exploration techniques for HLS primarily focus on either single nested loop or multiple loops without consideration to the data dependencies among them. In this paper, we propose efficient design space exploration techniques for applications that consist of multiple nested loops with or without data dependencies. In particular, we develop an algorithm to derive the Pareto-optimal curve (performance versus area) of the application when mapped onto FPGAs using HLS. Our algorithm is efficient as it effectively prunes the dominated points in the design space. We also develop accurate performance and area models to assist the design space exploration process. Experiments on various scientific kernels and real-world applications demonstrate that our design space exploration technique is accurate and efficient.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974719","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974719","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6964907/6974646/06974719.pdf","startPage":"456","endPage":"463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6974646","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974719/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Design space exploration of multiple loops on FPGAs using high level synthesis","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14791861","htmlLink":"/document/6974719/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design space exploration of multiple loops on FPGAs using high level synthesis","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p456.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079756S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6964907","isNumber":"6974646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6964907","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6974646","articleId":"6974719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6974721,"authors":[{"name":"Yuchun Ma","affiliation":["Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Yuchun","lastName":"Ma","id":"37274225700"},{"name":"Jinglan Liu","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Jinglan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085462758"},{"name":"Chao Zhang","affiliation":["Imperial College"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085454591"},{"name":"Wayne Luk","affiliation":["Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Wayne","lastName":"Luk","id":"37272281200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6492-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"6974721","dbTime":"43 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":275},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974721","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Schedules","Prefetching","Delays","Partitioning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","integer programming","linear programming","software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HW/SW partitioning","region-based dynamic partial reconfigurable FPGAs","dynamic partial reconfigurable capability","software-hardware partitioning approaches","reconfiguration optimization","advanced region-based DPR design flow","task graph representation","mixed-integer linear programming","MILP","time-step based approach"]}],"abstract":"With dynamic partial reconfigurable (DPR) capability, an FPGA fabric is no longer static; some of its regions can be dynamically reused for different tasks. Hence current software/hardware (HW/SW) partitioning approaches are no longer applicable to such reconfigurable hardware. This paper incorporates reconfiguration optimization into HW/SW partitioning targeting advanced region-based DPR design flow. Instead of analyzing the tasks for each time step, we introduce a new task graph representation with additional reconfiguration nodes so that the HW/SW partitioning for region-based DPR designs can be optimally solved efficiently by a novel mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation. Experimental results show that our approach can obtain the optimal solutions 10 times faster than the current time-step based approach. For large designs which cannot be handled by the current approaches, our approach can achieve the optimum efficiently in reasonable runtime.","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6964907/6974646/06974721.pdf","startPage":"470","endPage":"476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974721","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974721","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6974646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HW/SW partitioning for region-based dynamic partial reconfigurable FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"HW/SW partitioning for region-based dynamic partial reconfigurable FPGAs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974721/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6974721/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14791896","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HW/SW partitioning for region-based dynamic partial reconfigurable FPGAs","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p470.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075698S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6964907","isNumber":"6974646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6964907","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6974646","articleId":"6974721","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6974727,"authors":[{"name":"Siddharth Advani","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University"],"firstName":"Siddharth","lastName":"Advani","id":"37863081600"},{"name":"Nandhini Chandramoorthy","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University"],"firstName":"Nandhini","lastName":"Chandramoorthy","id":"37085368635"},{"name":"Karthik Swaminathan","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University"],"firstName":"Karthik","lastName":"Swaminathan","id":"37967014100"},{"name":"Kevin Irick","affiliation":["SiliconScapes LLC."],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Irick","id":"37294765800"},{"name":"Yong Cheol Peter Cho","affiliation":["ETRI, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yong Cheol Peter","lastName":"Cho","id":"37085361823"},{"name":"Jack Sampson","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University"],"firstName":"Jack","lastName":"Sampson","id":"37085340593"},{"name":"Vijaykrishnan Narayanan","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University"],"firstName":"Vijaykrishnan","lastName":"Narayanan","id":"37067532900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6492-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"6974727","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":255},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Refresh Enabled Video Analytics (REVA): Implications on power and performance of DRAM supported embedded visual systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6964907/6974646/06974727.pdf","startPage":"501","endPage":"504","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6974646","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974727","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Streaming media","Computer architecture","Visualization","Standards","Computational modeling","Object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","embedded systems","image sensors","low-power electronics","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["refresh enabled video analytics","REVA system","embedded visual systems","video applications","ubiquitous","mobile systems","embedded systems","wearable video systems","Google Glasses","battery lifetimes","image sensors","memory storage","computational power","embedded architecture","multiobject scene","embedded video analytics applications","DRAM memory refresh energy","DRAM refresh scheme"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974727","abstract":"Video applications are becoming ubiquitous in mobile and embedded systems.

However, traditional HDLs lack a number of modern facilities and a rich ecosystem to express and test designs, which severely restricts the productivity of designers. In this paper, we propose ScalaHDL, an open-source domain-specific language (DSL) built on top of Scala, that enables designers to describe algorithms using a multi-paradigm programming language, and generate the required Verilog code to implement such systems. In addition, these designs can be simulated so that values can be tested programmatically using unit-tests. With ScalaHDL, designers can also leverage the rich and mature ecosystems provided by Java and Scala.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6964907/6974646/06974732.pdf","startPage":"521","endPage":"524","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974732","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6974646","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ScalaHDL: Express and test hardware designs in a Scala DSL","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware design languages","Registers","Libraries","Hardware","Java","Adders","DSL"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic engineering computing","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","Java","logic design","program compilers","public domain software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ScalaHDL","test hardware designs","Java","Verilog code","multiparadigm programming language","open source domain specific language","hardware description languages","FPGA","field programmable gate array","Scala DSL"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974732/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"ScalaHDL: Express and test hardware designs in a Scala DSL","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6974732/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14791871","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ScalaHDL: Express and test hardware designs in a Scala DSL","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p521.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084263S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6964907","isNumber":"6974646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6964907","xplore-issue":"6974646","articleId":"6974732","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6974752,"authors":[{"name":"Yasuo Sato","affiliation":["Japan Science and Technology Agency, CREST, Tokyo, Japan","Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuo","lastName":"Sato","id":"37402147400"},{"name":"Masafumi Monden","affiliation":["Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Masafumi","lastName":"Monden","id":"37085581657"},{"name":"Yousuke Miyake","affiliation":["Japan Science and Technology Agency, CREST, Tokyo, Japan","Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yousuke","lastName":"Miyake","id":"38251826800"},{"name":"Seiji Kajihara","affiliation":["Japan Science and Technology Agency, CREST, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Seiji","lastName":"Kajihara","id":"37085583719"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6474-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6473-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6974752","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":331},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ring oscillators","Degradation","Table lookup","Field programmable gate arrays","MOSFET","Temperature measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","large scale integration","logic gates","MOSFET","negative bias temperature instability","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Altera Cyclone IV device","look-up tables","PMOS transistors","aging-tolerant design structure","LSI reliability","FPGA","ring oscillators","NBTI-induced degradation","size 60 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ring Oscillator","FPGA","Aging","NBTI"]}],"abstract":"Ring Oscillators are used for variety of purposes to enhance reliability on LSIs or FPGAs.

described as a substantial global public-health concern. Naturally, patient safety has become an international priority. The increasing amount of electronically available clinical documents holds great potential for the computational analysis of large repositories. However, most of this data is in textual form and the clinical domain is a challenging field for the appliance of natural language processing. This is particularly the case if you deal with a language other than English, due to the little attention from the international research community. In this project, we are concerned with the utilization of a Germanspeaking operative report repository for the purpose of risk management and patient safety research. In this particular paper we focus on the description of our information retrieval approach. We investigated the thought process of a domain expert in order to derive his information of interest and describe a facet-based way to navigate this kind of information in the form of extracted phrases. Initial results and feedback has been very promising, but a formal evaluation is still missing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974852/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14792970","htmlLink":"/document/6974852/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","conferenceDate":"1-5 Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Enhancing Patient Safety through Human-Computer Information Retrieval on the Example of German-Speaking Surgical Reports","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing Patient Safety through Human-Computer Information Retrieval on the Example of German-Speaking Surgical Reports","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"5722a216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071801S","chronDate":"1-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973088","isNumber":"6974758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973088","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6974758","articleId":"6974852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6974862,"authors":[{"name":"Johannes S\u00e4nger","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"S\u00e4nger","id":"37085371854"},{"name":"Christian Richthammer","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Richthammer","id":"37085407944"},{"name":"Sabri Hassan","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Sabri","lastName":"Hassan","id":"37085420726"},{"name":"G\u00fcnther Pernul","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany"],"firstName":"G\u00fcnther","lastName":"Pernul","id":"37267091300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5722-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5721-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1529-4188"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-3915"}],"articleNumber":"6974862","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":588},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Big data","Security","Cloud computing","Context","Computer science","Data mining","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","trusted computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","trust-related data","data-driven approaches","reputation-based trust management","focal issues","next generation online trust","FORSEC project"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Big Data","trust","reputation"]}],"abstract":"We are currently living in the age of Big Data coming along with the challenge to grasp the golden opportunities at hand. This mixed blessing also dominates the relation between Big Data and trust. On the one side, large amounts of trust-related data can be utilized to establish innovative data-driven approaches for reputation-based trust management. On the other side, this is intrinsically tied to the trust we can put in the origins and quality of the underlying data. In this paper, we address both sides of trust and Big Data by structuring the problem domain and presenting current research directions and inter-dependencies. Based on this, we define focal issues which serve as future research directions for the track to our vision of Next Generation Online Trust within the FORSEC project.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trust and Big Data: A Roadmap for Research","publicationTitle":"2014 25th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications","doi":"10.1109/DEXA.2014.63","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 25th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6973088/6974758/06974862.pdf","startPage":"278","endPage":"282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DEXA.2014.63","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6974758","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974862","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974862/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Trust and Big Data: A Roadmap for Research","conferenceDate":"1-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6974862/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14792962","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trust and Big Data: A Roadmap for Research","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"5722a278.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05805S","chronDate":"1-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973088","isNumber":"6974758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973088","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6974758","articleId":"6974862","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6974961,"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7381-9416-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6974961","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":5089},"abstract":"A methodology for accessing instrumentation embedded within a semiconductor device, without defining the instruments or their features themselves, via the IEEE 1149.1(TM) test access port (TAP) and/or other signals, is described in this standard.

In such an environment, vehicles on the road may act as source provider or consumer to facilitate various users connected to the Internet. Content distribution to all these objects especially to the vehicles in this environment is a challenging task due to the tight constraints of maintaining connectivity, coverage, and topology of the vehicles. To address these issues, in this paper, we proposed a new Bayesian coalition game (BCG) as-a-service for content distribution among these objects using support from cloud. We have addressed the problem of content distribution to vehicles from the perspective of BCG and learning automata (LA). Content are assumed to be located at the cloud, which is accessed by the vehicles through Internet even on-the-fly. Vehicles are assumed to be the players in the game and form a coalition among themselves using Markov decision process (MDP). For each action taken by an automaton, it may get a reward or a penalty from the environment according to which it updates its action probability vector. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated be selecting various parameters. The results obtained show that proposed scheme is effective in building next generation IoV environment.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehiclular ad hoc networks","Road traffic","Bayes methods","Learning automata","Cloud computing","Automata"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","cloud computing","game theory","intelligent transportation systems","learning automata","Markov processes","road vehicles","smart cities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian coalition game as-a-service","content distribution","Internet of vehicles","cloud computing","next generation infrastructure","intelligent sensors","actuators","home appliances","high-computing servers","computers","source provider","BCG as-a-service","learning automata","Markov decision process","MDP","action probability vector","next generation IoV environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Vehicular Cloud","Learning Automata","Bayesian Coalition Game","Smart City"]},{"kwd":["Bayesian coalition game (BCG)","learning automata (LA)","smart city","vehicular cloud"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974979","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2014.2374606","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/6981999/06974979.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/06974979.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2014.2374606","startPage":"544","endPage":"555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6981999","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian Coalition Game as-a-Service for Content Distribution in Internet of Vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian Coalition Game as-a-Service for Content Distribution in Internet of Vehicles","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974979/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","volume":"1","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6974979/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14818067","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Next Generation Networks and Applications Group (NetGNA), Covilh\u00e3 Delegation"},{"fundingName":"Government of Russian Federation","grantNumber":"074-U01"},{"fundingName":"National Funding from the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia (FCT)","grantNumber":"OE/EEI/LA0008/2013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian Coalition Game as-a-Service for Content Distribution in Internet of Vehicles","sourcePdf":"jiot-rodrigues-2374606-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103041S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"6981999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"6981999","articleId":"6974979","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":6974982,"authors":[{"name":"Saleem Khan","affiliation":["University of Trento, Trento, Italy","Centre of Materials and Microsystems, Microsystems Technology Research Unit, Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Trento, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7086408/6974982/khan-2375203-small.gif","p":["Saleem Khan received the master\u2019s degree in electronic engineering from Jeju National University, Jeju City, Korea, and the B.S. degree in engineering sciences with a specialization in lasers and optoelectronics from the Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology, Topi, Pakistan.

The slip transparent LDPC codes correct single bit error events but are transparent to phase slips. The phase slips, which correspond to runs of bit errors, are corrected by the outer coding part of the receiver.

One of these imbalances, namely the receiver skew, becomes increasingly important when higher symbol rates, higher modulation orders, and low roll-off pulse shapes are used. Here, we evaluate the performance of receiver skew compensation based on a complex-valued multiple-input multiple-output 4 \u00d7 2 adaptive equalizer that is tolerant to large residual chromatic dispersion. In addition, we derive skew estimation from converged equalizer taps. Both the adaptive equalizer and the derived estimator are validated experimentally with offline processing through long-haul transmission of 46 Gbaud signal over a non-dispersion-managed test bed. The transmitted signal is Nyquist pulse shaped with a root-raised-cosine filter with 0.1 roll-off factor, polarization division multiplexed, and modulated with 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2014.2377582","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7054609/06974986.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7054609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2014.2377582","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","startPage":"1315","endPage":"1318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Receiver Skew Compensation and Estimation for Long-Haul Non-Dispersion Managed Systems Using Adaptive Equalizer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974986","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April1, 1 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Blind Receiver Skew Compensation and Estimation for Long-Haul Non-Dispersion Managed Systems Using Adaptive Equalizer","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974986/","volume":"33","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6974986/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 April1, 2015","accessionNumber":"14982558","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Receiver Skew Compensation and Estimation for Long-Haul Non-Dispersion Managed Systems Using Adaptive Equalizer","sourcePdf":"jlt-riosmuller-2377582-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057777S","chronDate":"April1, 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7054609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7054609","articleId":"6974986","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6974987,"authors":[{"name":"Subhas Chandra Mukhopadhyay","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Advanced Technology, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/6982245/6974987/mukho-2370945-small.gif","p":["Subhas Chandra Mukhopadhyay (M\u201997\u2013SM\u201902\u2013F\u201911) received the Degree (Hons.) from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India, the master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India, the Ph.D. (Eng.) degree from Jadavpur University, and the Dr.Ing. degree from Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.","He is currently a Professor of Sensing Technology with the School of Engineering and Advanced Technology, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.

Multiuser multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO), an advanced form of MIMO, has gained attention due to its huge potential in improving the performance of WLANs. This paper surveys random access-based medium access control (MAC) protocols for MU-MIMO-enabled WLANs. It first provides background information about the evolution and the fundamental MAC schemes of IEEE 802.11 Standards and Amendments, and then identifies the key requirements of designing MU-MIMO MAC protocols for WLANs. After this, the most representative MU-MIMO MAC proposals in the literature are overviewed by benchmarking their MAC procedures and examining the key components, such as the channel state information acquisition, decoding/precoding, and scheduling schemes. Classifications and discussions on important findings of the surveyed MAC protocols are provided, based on which, the research challenges for designing effective MU-MIMO MAC protocols, as well as the envisaged MAC's role in the future heterogeneous networks, are highlighted.","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2014.2377373","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/7393921/06974988.pdf","startPage":"162","endPage":"183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7393921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2014.2377373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MU-MIMO MAC Protocols for Wireless Local Area Networks: A Survey","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974988","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Firstquarter  2016","displayDocTitle":"MU-MIMO MAC Protocols for Wireless Local Area Networks: A Survey","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974988/","publicationDate":"Firstquarter 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15730375","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6974988/","volume":"18","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Spanish Government"},{"fundingName":"Catalan Government"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2012CB316001"},{"fundingName":"Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61201191, 60925002 and 61021001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MU-MIMO MAC Protocols for Wireless Local Area Networks: A Survey","sourcePdf":"comst-liao-2377373-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.234862S","chronDate":"Firstquarter  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7393921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"7393921","articleId":"6974988","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6974994,"authors":[{"name":"Danish Rafique","affiliation":["Coriant R&D GmbH, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Danish Rafique received the B.Sc. degree from FAST-NU, Pakistan, in\n 2007, the M.Sc. degree from, KTH, Sweden, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree from Tyndall National Institute, University\n College Cork, Ireland, in 2012, all in electrical engineering.

One of the major challenges faced by these transponders is the limited resolution and -3 dB electrical bandwidth of the digital-to-analog converters (DAC), severely limiting the transmission performance. On the other hand, these spectrally efficient flexible transport networks are extremely sensitive to nonlinear channel impairments, essentially limiting the maximum system reach. In this paper, we employ a simple digital pre-emphasis (DPE) algorithm to mitigate DAC-induced signal distortions, and further report on the impact of DPE algorithm on nonlinear transmission performance. We demonstrate, both numerically and experimentally, that DPE not only counteracts DAC low-pass response, allowing for higher baud rate transmission, but also enables better nonlinear channel tolerance. In particular, we first establish the maximum transmittable baud rates in back-to-back configuration for polarization multiplexed m-state quadrature amplitude modulation (PM-mQAM) formats, allowing up to 50, 46 and 44 Gbaud transmission for PM-4QAM, PM-8QAM, and PM-16QAM, respectively assuming typical DAC specifications of 16 GHz -3 dB bandwidth and 5.5 effective number of bits. Furthermore, we show that the performance improvements from DPE increase with increasing modulation order and decreasing span count, with maximum improvements of up to ~2.2 dB. In a conventional standard single mode fiber transmission link with lumped amplification, employing DPE, we report maximum reach of up to ~10 000, ~5000, and ~3000 km, for PM-4QAM, PM-8QAM, and PM-16QAM, respectively. Moreover, at pre-FEC bit-error-rate, relative reach improvements from DPE are found to be up to 21%, 25%, and 27%, respectively. Finally, we show that DPE gains are constant beyond a minimum required channel spacing, with minimum spacing requirements of 1.1 \u00d7 baud rate, 1.15 \u00d7 baud rate, and 1.2 \u00d7 baud rate for PM-4QAM\u2192PM-16QAM, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2014.2378374","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/6987389/06974994.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2014.2378374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6987389","startPage":"140","endPage":"150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital Pre-Emphasis in Optical Communication Systems: On the Nonlinear Performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974994","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Digital Pre-Emphasis in Optical Communication Systems: On the Nonlinear Performance","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1, 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6974994/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"33","issue":"1","publicationDate":"1 Jan.1, 2015","accessionNumber":"14861912","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6974994/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002347","fundingName":"German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)","grantNumber":"01BP12300A"},{"fundingName":"EUREKA-Project SASER"},{"fundingName":"FP-7 project"},{"fundingName":"IDEALIST","grantNumber":"317999"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Pre-Emphasis in Optical Communication Systems: On the Nonlinear Performance","sourcePdf":"jlt-rafique-2378374-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133299S","chronDate":"Jan.1, 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6987389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6987389","articleId":"6974994","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6974995,"authors":[{"name":"Rajinder Singh Deol","affiliation":["Functional Materials and Devices Laboratory, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7086408/6974995/deol-2378144-small.gif","p":["Rajinder Singh Deol received the master\u2019s degree in microelectronics from Panjab University, Chandigarh, India, in 2013.

The main idea of our algorithm is to successively boost the detection by leveraging the hidden sparsity in the residual error of received signal. Specifically, since the symbol error rate (SER) of the MMSE detector is usually not high (say, less than 10%), the residual error, which is the difference between the original transmitted signal and the recovered one, would exhibit significant sparsity. Therefore, by locating the non-zero entries (i.e., the incorrectly detected symbols) via compressive sensing algorithms, we can reduce the original MIMO system to a new one, whose input dimension is much less than the output dimension. This implies that a linear detector will suffice for achieving near-optimal performance, otherwise we can repeat the above procedures to iteratively boost the detection till satisfaction. Overall, our proposed algorithm can achieve performance close to the optimal ML detector, while its complexity is just on the order of the linear detectors (say, MMSE detector).","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2377215","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7033064/06975016.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2377215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7033064","startPage":"191","endPage":"194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparsity-Boosted Detection for Large MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6975016","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sparsity-Boosted Detection for Large MIMO Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975016/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14914551","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6975016/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61231007"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project","grantNumber":"2013ZX03001015-002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparsity-Boosted Detection for Large MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"lcomm-wu-2377215-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046602S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7033064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7033064","articleId":"6975016","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6975021,"authors":[{"name":"Chris Matrakidis","affiliation":["Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Peloponnese, Tripolis, Greece"],"bio":{"p":["Chris Matrakidis received the electrical engineering degree from the\n University of Patras, Patras, Greece, and the Ph.D. degree from University College London (UCL), London, U.K., in the\n field of digital communications.

The key concept is the introduction of an active remote node that interfaces to end-users by means of the lowest cost/power consumption technology (short-range xPON, wireless, etc.) while on the core network side it employs adaptive ultra-long reach links to bypass the metropolitan area network. The scheme leads to a higher degree of node consolidation and access-core integration. We demonstrate that HYDRA can achieve very high performance based on mature component technologies ensuring very low cost end-user terminals, reduced complexity, and high scalability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975021/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15, 15 2015","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2015","accessionNumber":"14866713","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6975021/","publicationDate":"15 Jan.15, 2015","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"HYDRA: A Scalable Ultra Long Reach/High Capacity Access Network Architecture Featuring Lower Cost and Power Consumption","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"E\u03a0AN II-E\u03a0-3250-ACSIOM Greek General Secretariat of Research and Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HYDRA: A Scalable Ultra Long Reach/High Capacity Access Network Architecture Featuring Lower Cost and Power Consumption","sourcePdf":"jlt-matrakidis-2376774-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071571S","chronDate":"Jan.15, 15 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7018114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7018114","articleId":"6975021","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6975028,"authors":[{"name":"Jiancun Fan","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering (EIE), Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jiancun","lastName":"Fan","id":"37531315300"},{"name":"Zhikun Xu","affiliation":["China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhikun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085392838"},{"name":"Geoffrey Ye Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Geoffrey Ye","lastName":"Li","id":"38516728900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6975028","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":996},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gold","Interference","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Vectors","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cellular radio","MIMO communication","network coding","precoding","radio transmitters","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink cellular network","multiuser multiple-input multiple-output network","MU-MIMO network","maximal ratio transmission","MRT","zero-forcing precoder","Gamma distribution","transmitting antenna","ZF precoder"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MU-MIMO","linear precoders","performance analysis","downlink cellular networks","finite number of antennas"]},{"kwd":["MU-MIMO","linear precoders","performance analysis","downlink cellular networks","finite number of antennas"]}],"abstract":"In this article, we investigate achievable sum-rates of a multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) network with maximal ratio transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing (ZF) precoders for downlink cellular scenarios.

As an alternative, phase change memory (PCM) has demonstrated promising potential to serve as the main memory in deep submicrometer regime. The broad resistance range of PCM cells enables several cell modes with various densities, pertaining to multiple level cell (MLC), triple state cell (TSC), and single level cell (SLC). High-density mode outperforms low-density ones in terms of capacity and cost-per-bit, but suffers from a weaker cell endurance. Wear leveling strategies are proposed to enhance the memory endurance but encounter more challenges with the aggravating process variation. Due to endurance variations, physical domains are fabricated with irregular tenacity. As a result, balanced write traffic, which is the objective of traditional wear leveling, cannot fully exploit the PCM endurance since the weak parts will be worn out sooner than others. In this paper, considering process variation, we propose a cell morphing based wear leveling scheme. Cell morphing refers to the cell mode transformation between high density (e.g., MLC) and low densities (e.g., TSC and SLC). Instead of redistributing write operations, the proposed wear leveling scheme dynamically transforms weak and frequently written portions into low-density mode for endurance benefits. Multitier cell morphing schemes are proposed to support mode transformation among multiple density levels. The experimental results show 236% endurance improvement for single-tier cell morphing and 209% for two-tier cell morphing with 2% low-density page percentage, when compared with the most related work.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2014.2376989","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2014.2376989","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/7012128/06975062.pdf","startPage":"227","endPage":"237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7012128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wear Relief for High-Density Phase Change Memory Through Cell Morphing Considering Process Variation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975062/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Wear Relief for High-Density Phase Change Memory Through Cell Morphing Considering Process Variation","volume":"34","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2015","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14854510","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6975062/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China","grantNumber":"CityU 123811 and CityU 123210"},{"fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1012070"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61402059"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wear Relief for High-Density Phase Change Memory Through Cell Morphing Considering Process Variation","sourcePdf":"tcad-zhao-2376989-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083392S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"7012128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7012128","articleId":"6975062","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6975063,"authors":[{"name":"Corrado Sciancalepore","affiliation":["CEA, LETI, MINATEC campus, CEA-Grenoble, Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Corrado","lastName":"Sciancalepore","orcid":"0000-0003-1064-1330","id":"37846988100"},{"name":"Richard John Lycett","affiliation":["Photon Design Ltd., Oxford, U.K."],"firstName":"Richard John","lastName":"Lycett","id":"38570272200"},{"name":"Jacques A.

However, it is extremely difficult for investors to find useful trading rules based on numerous technical indicators. This paper innovatively proposes the use of biclustering mining to discover effective technical trading patterns that contain a combination of indicators from historical financial data series. This is the first attempt to use biclustering algorithm on trading data. The mined patterns are regarded as trading rules and can be classified as three trading actions (i.e., the buy, the sell, and no-action signals) with respect to the maximum support. A modified K nearest neighborhood (K-NN) method is applied to classification of trading days in the testing period. The proposed method [called biclustering algorithm and the K nearest neighbor (BIC-K-NN)] was implemented on four historical datasets and the average performance was compared with the conventional buy-and-hold strategy and three previously reported intelligent trading systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed trading system outperforms its counterparts and will be useful for investment in various financial markets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975065/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"45","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15456901","htmlLink":"/document/6975065/","pubMedId":"25494520","displayDocTitle":"Biclustering Learning of Trading Rules","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2012CB316400"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61125106 and 61372007"},{"fundingName":"Australian Research Council Linkage Project","grantNumber":"140100569"},{"fundingName":"Projects of Innovative Science and Technology, Department of Education, Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2013KJCX0012"},{"fundingName":"Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"KGZD-EW-T03"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biclustering Learning of Trading Rules","sourcePdf":"tcyb-li-2370063-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092283S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7265130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7265130","articleId":"6975065","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6975073,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Bauckhage","affiliation":["Fraunhofer IAIS, St. Augustin, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4804728/7254210/6975073/6975073-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christian Bauckhage (M'02) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany, in 1998 and 2002, respectively.","He is a Professor of Media Informatics and Pattern Recognition at the University of Bonn and Lead Scientists for Media Engineering at Fraunhofer IAIS, Bonn, Germany.

Reasons for this data surge are many and include the introduction of new business models, technical innovations, the popularity of online games, and the increasing persistence of games. Irrespective of the causes, the proliferation of behavioral data poses the problem of how to derive insights therefrom. Behavioral data sets can be large, time-dependent and high-dimensional. Clustering offers a way to explore such data and to discover patterns that can reduce the overall complexity of the data. Clustering and other techniques for player profiling and play style analysis have, therefore, become popular in the nascent field of game analytics. However, the proper use of clustering techniques requires expertise and an understanding of games is essential to evaluate results. With this paper, we address game data scientists and present a review and tutorial focusing on the application of clustering techniques to mine behavioral game data. Several algorithms are reviewed and examples of their application shown.

To eliminate the effect of these phase errors, we propose a DOA recovery technique that relies only on magnitude measurements. This approach is inspired by phase retrieval for applications in other fields. Ambiguities typically associated with phase retrieval methods are resolved by introducing reference targets with known DOA. The DOA estimation problem is formulated as a nonlinear optimization in a sparse framework, and is solved by the recently proposed GESPAR algorithm modified to accommodate multiple snapshots. Numerical results demonstrate good DOA estimation performance. For example, the probability of error in locating a single target within 2 degrees is less than 0.1 for SNR \u2265 15 dB and one snapshot, and negligible for SNR \u2265 10 dB and five snapshots.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Direction-of-arrival estimation","Estimation","Arrays","Synchronization","Phase measurement","Signal to noise ratio","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","nonlinear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noncoherent direction of arrival estimation","random sensor phase error","DOA recovery technique","magnitude measurement","phase retrieval method","reference target","nonlinear optimization","sparse framework","GESPAR algorithm","snapshot"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Direction of arrival","phase retrieval","sparsity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LSP.2014.2377556","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/6962924/06975080.pdf","startPage":"925","endPage":"929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6962924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2014.2377556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Coherent Direction of Arrival Estimation from Magnitude-Only Measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6975080","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Non-Coherent Direction of Arrival Estimation from Magnitude-Only Measurements","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975080/","volume":"22","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6975080/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14816741","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Coherent Direction of Arrival Estimation from Magnitude-Only Measurements","sourcePdf":"lsp-kim-2377556-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05365S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6962924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6962924","articleId":"6975080","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6975088,"authors":[{"name":"Jyi-Tsong Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6994894/6975088/plin-2372789-small.gif","p":["Jyi-Tsong Lin (M\u201996\u2013SM\u201908) was born in Taiwan in 1959.

This 1T-DRAM exhibits favorable transient performance after word line (WL)/bit line (BL) disturbance, which is verified using Sentaurus TCAD 12.0. The proposed memory cell can be fabricated with a feature area of 4F\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n and with processes that are fully compatible with conventional CMOS technology. Extended simulations reveal three key findings. First, the WT-SGT achieves a high-speed programming operation (1.17 ns) at a low operating voltage (1.6 V) and with a programming window that can be further extended by widening its trenched body. Second, the recombination rate is also reduced, thereby yielding an acceptable retention time (RT) of 625.6 ms. Third, the decreased RT after a 100-ns WL/BL disturbance is improved by 33%, as compared with a conventional SGT 1T-DRAM. We, therefore, believe that this new device will become a competitive candidate for use in future DRAM cells.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975088/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6975088/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14834697","volume":"62","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Transient and Thermal Analysis on Disturbance Immunity for 4<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathrm{F}^{2}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> Surrounding Gate 1T-DRAM With Wide Trenched Body","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Council of Taiwan","grantNumber":"NSC-102-2221-E-110-078-MY2"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transient and Thermal Analysis on Disturbance Immunity for 4<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathrm{F}^{2}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> Surrounding Gate 1T-DRAM With Wide Trenched Body","sourcePdf":"ted-lin-2372789-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076147S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"6994894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6994894","articleId":"6975088","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6975090,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7265130/6975090/li-2365354-small.gif","p":["Ke Li received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in computer science and technology from Xiangtan University, Xiangtan, China, in 2007 and 2010, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2014.","He is currently a Post-Doctoral Research Associate with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA.

It decomposes a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) into a number of optimization subproblems. Each subproblem is handled by an agent in a collaborative manner. The selection of MOEA/D is a process of choosing solutions by agents. In particular, each agent has two requirements on its selected solution: one is the convergence toward the efficient front, the other is the distinction with the other agents' choices. This paper suggests addressing these two requirements by defining mutual-preferences between subproblems and solutions. Afterwards, a simple yet effective method is proposed to build an interrelationship between subproblems and solutions, based on their mutual-preferences. At each generation, this interrelationship is used as a guideline to select the elite solutions to survive as the next parents. By considering the mutual-preferences between subproblems and solutions (i.e., the two requirements of each agent), the selection operator is able to balance the convergence and diversity of the search process. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on several MOP test instances with complicated Pareto sets. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of our proposed algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975090/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","volume":"45","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15456907","pubMedId":"25494518","htmlLink":"/document/6975090/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Interrelationship-Based Selection for Decomposition Multiobjective Optimization","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Hong Kong Research Grants Council General Research Funding","grantNumber":"9042038 (CityU 11205314)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"6147324"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interrelationship-Based Selection for Decomposition Multiobjective Optimization","sourcePdf":"tcyb-kwong-2365354-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093109S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7265130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"7265130","articleId":"6975090","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6975096,"authors":[{"name":"Mutsam A.

In this paper, we propose a knee point-driven EA to solve MaOPs. Our basic idea is that knee points are naturally most preferred among nondominated solutions if no explicit user preferences are given. A bias toward the knee points in the nondominated solutions in the current population is shown to be an approximation of a bias toward a large hypervolume, thereby enhancing the convergence performance in many-objective optimization. In addition, as at most one solution will be identified as a knee point inside the neighborhood of each solution in the nondominated front, no additional diversity maintenance mechanisms need to be introduced in the proposed algorithm, considerably reducing the computational complexity compared to many existing multiobjective EAs for many-objective optimization. Experimental results on 16 test problems demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of both solution quality and computational efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2014.2378512","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/4235/7337505/06975108.pdf","startPage":"761","endPage":"776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7337505","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2014.2378512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Knee Point-Driven Evolutionary Algorithm for Many-Objective Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6975108","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"A Knee Point-Driven Evolutionary Algorithm for Many-Objective Optimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975108/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15618402","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6975108/","volume":"19","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61272152, 61033003, 61202011 and 61472002"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Higher Education Institutions of China","grantNumber":"KJ2012A010"},{"fundingName":"Joint Research Fund for Overseas Chinese, Hong Kong"},{"fundingName":"Macao Scholars of the National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61428302"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Knee Point-Driven Evolutionary Algorithm for Many-Objective Optimization","sourcePdf":"tevc-jin-2378512-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152373S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"7337505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"374","xplore-issue":"7337505","articleId":"6975108","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6975109,"authors":[{"name":"Rodrigo M.

In this letter we propose a novel blind spatial spectrum sensing method to conquer this problem. We utilize an Electronically Steerable Parasitic Antenna Receptor (ESPAR) which can divide the space into several sectors and switch receive beampattern to each sector in a time-division fashion. The difference of received signal energies among sectors heavily depends on the presence/absence of the primary user (PU) signal. Motivated by this fact, we introduce a blind energy-based spatial spectrum sensing algorithm using the ratio of maximum-minimum energy (MMEN). The MMEN spectrum sensing method can overcome the noise uncertainty problem and achieve higher accuracy performance with lower computational complexity. Theoretical performance analysis of the proposed MMEN method is also provided.

Recently, due to the advantage of joint encryption and compression for data transmission in CPS, the emerging compressed sensing (CS)-based cryptosystem has attracted much attention, where security is of extreme importance. The existing methods only analyze the security of the plaintext under the assumption that the key is absolutely safe. However, for sparse plaintext, the prior sparsity knowledge of the plaintext could be exploited to partly retrieve the key, and then the plaintext, from the ciphertext. So, the existing methods do not provide a satisfactory security analysis. In this paper, it is conducted in the information theory frame, where the plaintext sparsity feature and the mutual information of the ciphertext, key, and plaintext are involved. In addition, the perfect secrecy criteria (Shannon-sense and Wyner-sense) are extended to measure the security. While the security level is given, the illegal access risk is also discussed. It is shown that the CS-based cryptosystem achieves the extended Wyner-sense perfect secrecy, but when the key is used repeatedly, both the plaintext and the key could be conditionally accessed.","doi":"10.1109/TETC.2014.2372151","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245516/7225202/06975126.pdf","startPage":"363","endPage":"371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TETC.2014.2372151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Security of Compressed Sensing-Based Signal Cryptosystem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6975126","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975126/","displayDocTitle":"On the Security of Compressed Sensing-Based Signal Cryptosystem","volume":"3","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15415825","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6975126/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004602","fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"NCET-13-0740"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"S2011030002886"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar","grantNumber":"2014A030306037"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61104053, 61322306, 61333013 and 61273192"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP 110102076"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"On the Security of Compressed Sensing-Based Signal Cryptosystem","sourcePdf":"tetc-yang-2372151-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.214668S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6245516","isNumber":"7225202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245516","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7225202","articleId":"6975126","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6975143,"authors":[{"name":"Yulong Zou","affiliation":["School of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7010064/6975143/zou-2377239_print-small.gif","p":["\nYulong Zou (S'07\u2013M'12\u2013SM'13) received the B.Eng. degree in\ninformation engineering from NUPT, Nanjing, China, in July 2006, the first Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from\nthe Stevens Institute of Technology, New Jersey, the United States, in May 2012, and the second Ph.D. degree in signal\nand information processing from NUPT, Nanjing, China, in July 2012.

We rely on careful relay selection for protecting the ST-SD transmission against the eavesdropper with the aid of both single-relay and multi-relay selection. To be specific, only the \u201cbest\u201d SR is chosen in the single-relay selection for assisting the secondary transmission, whereas the multi-relay selection invokes multiple SRs for simultaneously forwarding the ST's transmission to the SD. We analyze both the intercept probability and outage probability of the proposed single-relay and multi-relay selection schemes for the secondary transmission relying on realistic spectrum sensing. We also evaluate the performance of classic direct transmission and artificial noise based methods for the purpose of comparison with the proposed relay selection schemes. It is shown that as the intercept probability requirement is relaxed, the outage performance of the direct transmission, the artificial noise based and the relay selection schemes improves, and vice versa. This implies a trade-off between the security and reliability of the secondary transmission in the presence of eavesdropping attacks, which is referred to as the security-reliability trade-off (SRT). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the SRTs of the single-relay and multi-relay selection schemes are generally better than that of classic direct transmission, explicitly demonstrating the advantage of the proposed relay selection in terms of protecting the secondary transmissions against eavesdropping attacks. Moreover, as the number of SRs increases, the SRTs of the proposed single-relay and multi-relay selection approaches significantly improve. Finally, our numerical results show that as expected, the multi-relay selection scheme achieves a better SRT performance than the single-relay selection.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2377239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2377239","startPage":"215","endPage":"228","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7010064/06975143.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7010064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay-Selection Improves the Security-Reliability Trade-Off in Cognitive Radio Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975143/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Relay-Selection Improves the Security-Reliability Trade-Off in Cognitive Radio Systems","volume":"63","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2015","accessionNumber":"14851080","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6975143/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61302104 and 61401223"},{"fundingName":"Scientific Research Foundation of Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications","grantNumber":"NY213014 and NY214001"},{"fundingName":"1311 Talent Program of Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20140887"},{"fundingName":"Programme de bourses d'excellence pour etudiants etrangers (PBEEE) of the Government of Quebec"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay-Selection Improves the Security-Reliability Trade-Off in Cognitive Radio Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-hanzo-2377239-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102868S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7010064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"188","xplore-issue":"7010064","articleId":"6975143","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6975147,"authors":[{"name":"Abdulmohsen Mutairi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7010064/6975147/mutai-2377177_print-small.gif","p":["\nAbdulmohsen Mutairi (M'08) received the B.S. degree in computer\nengineering and the M.S. degree in computer networks from King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi\nArabia, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA, in 2014.

The proposed OFDM reservation random access (OFDM-RR) protocol builds upon a generalized version of the frequency-domain backoff scheme, which was originally proposed for WiFi networks. In this protocol, each node chooses one of K subchannels randomly and transmits a short reservation request on the corresponding subchannel. At the end of the slot, the node whose subchannel index is the highest wins the contention and immediately transmits on the full channel. A tie on the highest index is treated as a collision and is resolved by repeating the process with only those nodes involved in the collision. The throughput of this protocol is derived and compared with that of the classic reservation Aloha (R-Aloha) with the same total channel bandwidth. Although channelization increases the transmission time of the reservation packet in OFDM-RR (due to the smaller subchannel bandwidth), the collision resolution mechanism, which reduces the collision rate sharply, helps improve the throughput, particularly in the high-load region. For example, while R-Aloha almost collapses (near zero throughput) at an average load of ten requests/slot, the proposed protocol can provide a throughput of more than 55% at the same load using only two subchannels.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7010064/06975147.pdf","startPage":"301","endPage":"310","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2377177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2377177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7010064","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6975147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An OFDM-Aware Reservation Random Access Protocol for Interference Mitigation in OFDMA Femtocells","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Femtocells","Interference","Throughput","Access protocols","Indexes","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","femtocellular radio","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM aware reservation random access protocol","interference mitigation","OFDMA femtocells","frequency diversity","femtocell interference","decentralized cellular network","OFDM reservation random access protocol","OFDM-RR protocol","WiFi networks","subchannel index","channel bandwidth","transmission time","reservation packet","collision resolution mechanism"]},{"kwd":["OFDM multiple access interface","random access protocols","4G mobile communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975147/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"An OFDM-Aware Reservation Random Access Protocol for Interference Mitigation in OFDMA Femtocells","volume":"63","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6975147/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"14851093","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An OFDM-Aware Reservation Random Access Protocol for Interference Mitigation in OFDMA Femtocells","sourcePdf":"tcomm-mutairi-2377177-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088302S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7010064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7010064","articleId":"6975147","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6975151,"authors":[{"name":"Miaohui Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Miaohui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086263510"},{"name":"King Ngi Ngan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"King Ngi","lastName":"Ngan","id":"37270879000"},{"name":"Hongliang Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Hongliang","lastName":"Li","id":"37281093800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"6975151","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1513},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6975151","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Bit rate","Video coding","Complexity theory","Computational modeling","Bandwidth","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video codecs","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intra frame coding","video quality","bit estimation error","CTU level bit allocation method","coding tree unit","intra frame rate control","gradient based R-lambda model","bit rate control","frame-content complexity","R-lambda based rate control model","HEVC encoder","rate control algorithms","HEVC standard","high-fidelity video services","high efficiency video coding","efficient frame-content based intra frame rate control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frame-content complexity","HEVC","lagrange multiplier","perceptual coding","rate control"]}],"abstract":"Rate control plays an important role in the rapid development of high-fidelity video services. As the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard has been finalized, many rate control algorithms are being developed to promote its commercial use. The HEVC encoder adopts a new R-lambda based rate control model to reduce the bit estimation error. However, the R-lambda model fails to consider the frame-content complexity that ultimately degrades the performance of the bit rate control. In this letter, a gradient based R-lambda (GRL) model is proposed for the intra frame rate control, where the gradient can effectively measure the frame-content complexity and enhance the performance of the traditional R-lambda method. In addition, a new coding tree unit (CTU) level bit allocation method is developed. The simulation results show that the proposed GRL method can reduce the bit estimation error and improve the video quality in HEVC all intra frame coding.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6962924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2014.2377032","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/6962924/06975151.pdf","startPage":"896","endPage":"900","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2014.2377032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Frame-Content Based Intra Frame Rate Control for High Efficiency Video Coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Frame-Content Based Intra Frame Rate Control for High Efficiency Video Coding","volume":"22","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6975151/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"14816747","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975151/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Frame-Content Based Intra Frame Rate Control for High Efficiency Video Coding","sourcePdf":"lsp-wang-2377032-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10229S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6962924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6962924","articleId":"6975151","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6975156,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6978084/6975156/hu-2378055-small.gif","p":["Wei Hu (SM\u201911) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2010.

Leveraging on recent advances in graph signal processing, in this paper, we propose to compress the PWS images using suitable graph Fourier transforms (GFTs) to minimize the total signal representation cost of each pixel block, considering both the sparsity of the signal's transform coefficients and the compactness of transform description. Unlike fixed transforms, such as the discrete cosine transform, we can adapt GFT to a particular class of pixel blocks. In particular, we select one among a defined search space of GFTs to minimize total representation cost via our proposed algorithms, leveraging on graph optimization techniques, such as spectral clustering and minimum graph cuts. Furthermore, for practical implementation of GFT, we introduce two techniques to reduce computation complexity. First, at the encoder, we low-pass filter and downsample a high-resolution (HR) pixel block to obtain a low-resolution (LR) one, so that a LR-GFT can be employed. At the decoder, upsampling and interpolation are performed adaptively along HR boundaries coded using arithmetic edge coding, so that sharp object boundaries can be well preserved. Second, instead of computing GFT from a graph in real-time via eigen-decomposition, the most popular LR-GFTs are pre-computed and stored in a table for lookup during encoding and decoding.

Existing rapid prototyping techniques (e.g., 3-D printing) can achieve complex geometries and are becoming increasingly accessible; however, they are limited to one or two materials and cannot seamlessly integrate active components. We propose an alternative approach called printable robots that takes advantage of available planar fabrication methods to create integrated electromechanical laminates that are subsequently folded into functional 3-D machines employing origami-inspired techniques. We designed, fabricated, and tested prototype origami robots to address the canonical robotics challenges of mobility and manipulation, and subsequently combined these designs to generate a new, multifunctional machine. The speed of the design and manufacturing process as well as the ease of composing designs create a new paradigm in robotic development, which has the promise to democratize access to customized robots for industrial, home, and educational use.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2014.2369854","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2014.2369854","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/3516/7230311/06975157.pdf","startPage":"2214","endPage":"2221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7230311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Origami-Inspired Printed Robots","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/3516/7230311/6975157-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975157/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Origami-Inspired Printed Robots","volume":"20","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15415718","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6975157/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation Expeditions Program","grantNumber":"CCF-1138967"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Origami-Inspired Printed Robots","sourcePdf":"tmech-onal-2369854-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118383S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"7230311","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"7230311","articleId":"6975157","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6975159,"authors":[{"name":"Tey Kok Soon","affiliation":["Power Electronics and Renewable Energy Research Laboratory (PEARL), Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/7027294/6975159/tsoon-2378231-small.gif","p":["Tey Kok Soon received the B.Eng.

Traditionally, maximum power point (MPP) locus was used to provide such a fast response. However, the algorithm requires extra control loop or intermittent disconnection of the PV module. Hence, this paper proposes a simpler fast-converging MPPT technique, which excludes the extra control loop and intermittent disconnection. In the proposed algorithm, the relationship between the load line and the I-V curve is used with trigonometry rule to obtain the fast response. Results of the simulation and experiment using single-ended primary-inductor converter showed that the response of the proposed algorithm is four times faster than the conventional incremental conductance algorithm during the load and solar irradiation variation. Consequently, the proposed algorithm has higher efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/7027294/06975159.pdf","startPage":"176","endPage":"186","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doi":"10.1109/TII.2014.2378231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2014.2378231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7027294","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6975159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast-Converging MPPT Technique for Photovoltaic System Under Fast-Varying Solar Irradiation and Load Resistance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiation effects","Resistance","Informatics","Voltage control","Maximum power point trackers","Load management","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum power point trackers","photovoltaic power systems","sunlight"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast-converging MPPT technique","photovoltaic system","fast-varying solar irradiation","load resistance","fast-converging maximum power point tracking system","PV system","power losses","control loop","PV module","intermittent disconnection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fast converging","Incremental Conductance","Maximum Power Point Tracking","Photovoltaic System","SEPIC converter"]},{"kwd":["Fast converging","incremental conductance","maximum power point tracking (MPPT)","photovoltaic (PV) system","single-ended primary-inductor converter (SEPIC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975159/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Fast-Converging MPPT Technique for Photovoltaic System Under Fast-Varying Solar Irradiation and Load Resistance","volume":"11","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6975159/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14915054","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002385","fundingName":"High Impact Research-Ministry of Higher Education","grantNumber":"UM.C/HIR/MOHE/ENG/17"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Grant Scheme","grantNumber":"FP014-2014A"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast-Converging MPPT Technique for Photovoltaic System Under Fast-Varying Solar Irradiation and Load Resistance","sourcePdf":"tii-tey-2378231-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0792S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"7027294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"136","xplore-issue":"7027294","articleId":"6975159","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6975161,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Zhong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory for Novel Software and the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7323911/6975161/zhong-2378372-small.gif","p":["\n\nSheng Zhong received the B.S. and M.E. degrees from Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, in 1996 and 1999, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, in 2004.","His research interests include security, privacy, and economic incentives."]},"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37085438996"},{"name":"Haifan Yao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, State University of New York, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7323911/6975161/yao-2378372-small.gif","p":["\n\nHaifan Yao received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2005 and 2009, respectively.

In this type of cooperative relay, some secondary users may have more spectra than needed; therefore, they can use their spare spectrum to relay traffic for other secondary users. While this type of cooperative relay has been studied extensively, a crucial problem in this type of cooperative relay lies in the (lack of) incentives for the potential relay nodes. To address this problem, we propose that relay nodes should receive payments for their relay services so that they have incentives to provide such services. Specifically, we design a Market for Incentive-compatible COoperative Relay (MICOR). MICOR allows each potential relay node to submit a valuation function, which describes how much payment its relay service is worth. MICOR guarantees that, under a precondition called No Monopoly, it is a Dominant Strategy Equilibrium for all potential relay nodes to submit their true valuation functions. To establish this precondition, we also design an algorithm for channel assignment that achieves the optimal monopoly reduction with a very high probability. Results of extensive evaluations demonstrate that MICOR provides strong incentives to potential relay nodes, effectively reduces monopoly, and has good efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2378372","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7323911/06975161.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2378372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7323911","startPage":"5350","endPage":"5367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MICOR: A Market for Incentive-Compatible Cooperative Relay in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6975161","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MICOR: A Market for Incentive-Compatible Cooperative Relay in Cognitive Radio Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975161/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"64","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15587060","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6975161/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MICOR: A Market for Incentive-Compatible Cooperative Relay in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-fang-2378372-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151059S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7323911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7323911","articleId":"6975161","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6975167,"authors":[{"name":"He Yin","affiliation":["University of Michigan-Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/7027294/6975167/heyin-2378596-small.gif","p":["He Yin (S\u201913) received the B.S. degree in the electrical and computer engineering from the University of Michigan-Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2012.

The example system employs the battery semiactive topology. In order to represent different performance and requirements of the battery and UC packs, the two packs are modeled as two independent but related agents using the NetLogo environment. Utility functions are designed to describe the respective preferences of battery and UC packs. Then, the control problem is converted to a multiobjective optimization problem solved by using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. The weights in the objective functions are chosen based on the location of the knee point in the Pareto set. Both the simulation and experimental results show the utility function-based control provides a comparable performance with the ideal average load demand (ALD)-based control, while the exact preknowledge of the future load demand is not required. The utility function-based control is fast enough to be directly implemented in real time. The discussion in this paper gives a starting point and initial results for dealing with more complex hybrid energy systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975167/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14915051","volume":"11","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6975167/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Utility Function-Based Real-Time Control of A Battery Ultracapacitor Hybrid Energy System","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51375299 and 51375302"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utility Function-Based Real-Time Control of A Battery Ultracapacitor Hybrid Energy System","sourcePdf":"tii-ma-2378596-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078215S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"7027294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"7027294","articleId":"6975167","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6975174,"authors":[{"name":"Chris de Beer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Advanced Machines and Energy Systems Group, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7137713/6975174/debee-2377131-small.gif","p":["\nChris de Beer (M'12) received the B.Eng. and B.Eng.(Hons.) \ndegrees in electrical engineering from the University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa, in 2007 and 2009, \nrespectively, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa, \nin 2011, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","From 2008 to 2011, he was with the Powertech Group designing small- and medium-scale power generation systems for \nindustrial plants.

High-temperature PEM fuel cells are still under development, and very little has been done to study transient conditions, specifically the application of small amplitude load transients for diagnostic purposes. This paper presents the evolution of the fuel cell voltage transient for small current pulses over a range of operating conditions. A fault mechanism in the form of CO poisoning is introduced to further study and evaluate the transients for diagnostic purposes. A new two-stage diagnostic method is proposed based on the voltage transient. The first stage makes use of the discrete S-transform for fault marker identification and provides fast estimations on the fuel cell state of health. The second stage makes use of a population-based incremental learning (PBIL) algorithm for equivalent circuit parameter extraction, required for detailed diagnostics. The method is evaluated for both the healthy and the faulted CO poisoning condition in order to verify performance.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2014.2377131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2014.2377131","startPage":"5175","endPage":"5186","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7137713/06975174.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7137713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Diagnostics of HTPEM Fuel Cells Using Small Amplitude Transient Analysis for CO Poisoning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Online Diagnostics of HTPEM Fuel Cells Using Small Amplitude Transient Analysis for CO Poisoning","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2015","volume":"62","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6975174/","accessionNumber":"15253561","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975174/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Diagnostics of HTPEM Fuel Cells Using Small Amplitude Transient Analysis for CO Poisoning","sourcePdf":"tie-barendse-2377131-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095775S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7137713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7137713","articleId":"6975174","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6975177,"authors":[{"name":"Samuel Marchal","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4275028/6994315/6975177/march-2377295-small.gif","p":["\nSamuel Marchal received the Engineering and M.Sc. degrees in computer\nscience from TELECOM Nancy, Villers-l\u00e9s-Nancy, France (a French leading school in computer science), in 2011.

This technique is inefficient due to the short lifetime of phishing Web sites, making recent approaches relying on real-time or proactive phishing URL detection techniques more appropriate. In this paper, we introduce PhishStorm, an automated phishing detection system that can analyze in real time any URL in order to identify potential phishing sites. PhishStorm can interface with any email server or HTTP proxy. We argue that phishing URLs usually have few relationships between the part of the URL that must be registered (low-level domain) and the remaining part of the URL (upper-level domain, path, query). We show in this paper that experimental evidence supports this observation and can be used to detect phishing sites. For this purpose, we define the new concept of intra-URL relatedness and evaluate it using features extracted from words that compose a URL based on query data from Google and Yahoo search engines. These features are then used in machine-learning-based classification to detect phishing URLs from a real dataset. Our technique is assessed on 96 018 phishing and legitimate URLs that result in a correct classification rate of 94.91% with only 1.44% false positives. An extension for a URL phishingness rating system exhibiting high confidence rate ( $>$ 99%) is proposed. We discuss in this paper efficient implementation patterns that allow real-time analytics using Big Data architectures such as STORM and advanced data structures based on the Bloom filter.","doi":"10.1109/TNSM.2014.2377295","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","pdfPath":"/iel7/4275028/6994315/06975177.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSM.2014.2377295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6994315","startPage":"458","endPage":"471","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PhishStorm: Detecting Phishing With Streaming Analytics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6975177","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PhishStorm: Detecting Phishing With Streaming Analytics","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975177/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14820025","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/6975177/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fonds National de la Recherche, Luxembourg","grantNumber":"3967419"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PhishStorm: Detecting Phishing With Streaming Analytics","sourcePdf":"tnsm-marchal-2377295-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11378S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4275028","isNumber":"6994315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4275028","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"6994315","articleId":"6975177","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6975182,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan T.

Traditional methods for recovering scene properties such as shape, reflectance, or illumination rely on multiple observations of the same scene to overconstrain the problem. Recovering these same properties from a single image seems almost impossible in comparison-there are an infinite number of shapes, paint, and lights that exactly reproduce a single image. However, certain explanations are more likely than others: surfaces tend to be smooth, paint tends to be uniform, and illumination tends to be natural. We therefore pose this problem as one of statistical inference, and define an optimization problem that searches for the most likely explanation of a single image. Our technique can be viewed as a superset of several classic computer vision problems (shape-from-shading, intrinsic images, color constancy, illumination estimation, etc) and outperforms all previous solutions to those constituent problems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/7140864/06975182.pdf","startPage":"1670","endPage":"1687","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2377712","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2377712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7140864","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6975182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shape, Illumination, and Reflectance from Shading","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lighting","Shape","Image color analysis","GSM","Computer vision","Paints","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","image colour analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reflectance","computer vision","3D structure","2D images","scene properties","paint","image explanation","shape-from-shading","intrinsic images","color constancy","illumination estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer Vision","Machine Learning","Intrinsic Images","Shape from Shading","Color Constancy","Shape Estimation"]},{"kwd":["Computer vision","machine learning","intrinsic images","shape from shading","color constancy","shape estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975182/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Shape, Illumination, and Reflectance from Shading","volume":"37","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6975182/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15258485","pubMedId":"26353003","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"US National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"N00014-10-10933"},{"fundingName":"GRFP","grantNumber":"N00014-10-10933"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"ONR","grantNumber":"N00014-10-10933"},{"fundingName":"MURI","grantNumber":"N00014-10-10933"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shape, Illumination, and Reflectance from Shading","sourcePdf":"tpami-barron-2377712-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168388S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"7140864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"291","xplore-issue":"7140864","articleId":"6975182","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6975184,"authors":[{"name":"Zheyu Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7112252/6975184/zhang-small.gif","p":["Zheyu Zhang (S\u201912) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in\n electrical engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2008 and 2011,\n respectively.

However, the observed switching performance of SiC devices in a PWM inverter for induction motor drives is almost always worse than the DPT characterization, with slower switching speed, more switching losses, and more serious parasitic ringing. This paper systematically investigates the factors that limit the SiC switching performance from both the motor side and inverter side, including the load characteristics of induction motor and power cable, two more phase legs for the three-phase PWM inverter in comparison with the DPT, and the parasitic capacitive coupling effect between power devices and heat sink. Based on a three-phase PWM inverter with 1200 V SiC MOSFETs, test results show that the induction motor, especially with a relatively long power cable, will significantly impact the switching performance, leading to a switching time increase by a factor of 2, switching loss increase up to 30% in comparison with that yielded from DPT, and serious parasitic ringing with 1.5 \u03bcs duration, which is more than 50 times of the corresponding switching time. In addition, the interactions among the three phase legs cannot be ignored unless the decoupling capacitors are mounted close to each phase leg to support the dc bus voltage during switching transients. Also, the coupling capacitance due to the heat sink equivalently increases the junction capacitance of power devices; however, its influence on the switching behavior in the motor drives is small considering the relatively large capacitance of the motor load.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7112252/06975184.pdf","startPage":"5701","endPage":"5711","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2014.2375827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2014.2375827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7112252","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6975184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Switching Performance of SiC Devices in PWM Inverter-Fed Induction Motor Drives","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Induction motors","Silicon carbide","Impedance","Inverters","Power cables","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","heat sinks","induction motor drives","machine testing","power cable testing","power MOSFET","PWM invertors","semiconductor device testing","silicon compounds","switching convertors","switching transients","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switching performance","three-phase PWM inverter-fed induction motor drive","double pulse testing","semiconductor switch","DPT characterization","parasitic ringing","load characteristics","power cable","parasitic capacitive coupling effect","power device","heat sink","decoupling capacitor","DC bus voltage","switching transient","coupling capacitance","junction capacitance","voltage 1200 V","time 1.5 mus","SiC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SiC Devices","Switching Performance","Motor Drives"]},{"kwd":["Motor drives","SiC devices","switching performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975184/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Switching Performance of SiC Devices in PWM Inverter-Fed Induction Motor Drives","volume":"30","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6975184/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15144581","dateOfInsertion":"22 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"II-VI Foundation"},{"fundingName":"Engineering Research Center Shared Facilities"},{"fundingName":"Engineering Research Center Program of the National Science Foundation"},{"fundingName":"DOE","grantNumber":"EEC-1041877"},{"fundingName":"CURENT Industry Partnership Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Switching Performance of SiC Devices in PWM Inverter-Fed Induction Motor Drives","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhang-2375827-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059539S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7112252","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"7112252","articleId":"6975184","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6975185,"authors":[{"name":"Jo\u00e3o Pedro F.

The energy management strategy uses an integrated rule-based metaheuristic approach to obtain solutions for sharing energy and power between two sources with different characteristics, namely, one with high specific energy and another with high specific power. A comprehensive real-time architecture for the energy management system is presented considering different management levels. The proposed approach determines an optimized real-time energy sharing between the sources without prior knowledge of the power demand profile. The multilevel energy management strategy has been validated using power-level reduced-scale hardware-in-the-loop simulations for a normalized urban driving cycle. The experimental results show the effectiveness of a real-time implementation based on particle swarm optimization supported by a set of rules restricting the search space. This strategy is effective in controlling the energy sources to work in their higher efficiency region and in satisfying the dynamic performance of the vehicle.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7080969","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2014.2376883","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7080969/06975185.pdf","startPage":"3223","endPage":"3233","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2014.2376883","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Real-Time Energy Management Architecture for Multisource Electric Vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","displayDocTitle":"A Real-Time Energy Management Architecture for Multisource Electric Vehicles","volume":"62","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6975185/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15035998","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975185/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology","grantNumber":"PEst-OE/EEI/UI308/2014, PTDC/EEA-EEL/121284/2010 and FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-020391"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Real-Time Energy Management Architecture for Multisource Electric Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tie-trovao-2376883-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137799S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7080969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"7080969","articleId":"6975185","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":6975187,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Guan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7323911/6975187/guan-2377299-small.gif","p":["\n\nLei Guan received the B.S. degree in communications engineering from Xidian University, Xi'an, China.

Moreover, an appropriate WGFHS could minimize the impact of jamming on the CFH system. However, conventional WGFHS adopted in the CFH system performs poorly in statistical properties and FH synchronization. Therefore, we propose an algorithm called the classified pseudorandom perturbation (CPRP) that can generate a random and uniform WGFHS with its uniform distribution keeping invariable during wide-gap mapping. In addition, it can achieve a high FH synchronization probability because all of the required parameters can be obtained from the known real-time status and sensing results. The simulation results indicate that the WGFHS generated by the CPRP outperforms the existing WGFHSs, such as the Reed-Solomon (RS) code with dual subbands (DSBs) and the chaotic sequences with shifting replacement.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7323911/06975187.pdf","startPage":"5056","endPage":"5069","publicationTitle":"IEEE

presents a zero-crossing-based pipeline analog-todigital converter (ADC) architecture that can effectively reduce hardware complexity and power consumption for high-speed ADCs. The ADC uses only simple open-loop amplifiers for residue amplification. Using modified sliding interpolation and subranging techniques, the number of amplifiers is reduced by 60%. A 10-bit 200-MS/s ADC, employing the architecture and other techniques, such as double sampling, digital error correction, and source degeneration, is fabricated in 0.13-\u03bcm CMOS process and occupies a die area of 0.7 mm2. The differential and integral nonlinearity of the ADC are less than 0.83/-0.47 and 1.05/-0.7 LSB, respectively. With a 1.5-MHz full-scale input, the ADC achieves 56.5-dB signal-to-noise plus distortion ratio, 71.8-dB spurious free dynamic range, and 9.1 effective number of bits at full sampling rate while dissipating 38 mW from a 1.2-V supply.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975192/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","volume":"23","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15553541","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6975192/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A 10-bit 200-MS/s Zero-Crossing-Based Pipeline ADC in 0.13-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mu $ </tex-math></inline-formula>m CMOS Technology","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003836","fundingName":"IC Design Education Center"},{"fundingName":"Space Core Technology Development Program through the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 10-bit 200-MS/s Zero-Crossing-Based Pipeline ADC in 0.13-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mu $ </tex-math></inline-formula>m CMOS Technology","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-lee-2371453-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075494S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7302619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7302619","articleId":"6975192","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6975195,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Fan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7080969/6975195/fan-2376879-small.gif","p":["\nYing Fan (M'07\u2013SM'14) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. \ndegrees from Nanjing University of Astronautics and Aeronautics, Nanjing, China, in 1991 and 1996, respectively, and \nthe Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, in \n2006.","Currently, she serves as an Associate Professor with and the Deputy Dean of the Department of Electric Machine and \nControl, Southeast University, Nanjing.

SVPWM-FADTC has several advantages over conventional hysteresis direct torque control, such as low torque/flux ripples in motor drive and reduced direct axis current when the motor is operated at a light or a sudden increased load. To achieve the sensorless control of SVPWM-FADTC system, a wide-speed SMO is proposed. Compared with conventional SMO, system chattering is improved, the low-pass filter and the phase compensation are eliminated, and the estimation accuracy of the rotor position at low speed is enhanced. Numerical simulations and experiments with a 2-kW FMPM wheel motor are carried out. The results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed sensorless SVPWM-FADTC method adopted by the FMPM wheel motor.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7080969/06975195.pdf","startPage":"3143","endPage":"3151","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2014.2376879","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2014.2376879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7080969","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6975195","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensorless SVPWM-FADTC of a New Flux-Modulated Permanent-Magnet Wheel Motor Based on a Wide-Speed Sliding Mode Observer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wheels","Torque","Stators","Brushless motors","Rotors","Hysteresis motors","Couplings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","low-pass filters","magnetic flux","observers","permanent magnet motors","rotors","sensorless machine control","torque control","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensorless SVPWM-FADTC control","flux-modulated permanent magnet wheel motor","wide-speed sliding mode observer","sensorless flux adaption direct torque control","FMPM wheel motor","space-vector pulsewidth modulation","SMO","low-pass filter elimination","phase compensation elimination","rotor position estimation","power 2 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Permanent-magnetic (PM) motor","flux-modulated wheel motor","direct torque control (DTC)","sliding mode observer (SMO)"]},{"kwd":["Direct torque control (DTC)","flux-modulated wheel motor","permanent-magnet (PM) motor","sliding mode observer (SMO)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975195/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Sensorless SVPWM-FADTC of a New Flux-Modulated Permanent-Magnet Wheel Motor Based on a Wide-Speed Sliding Mode Observer","volume":"62","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6975195/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15035983","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingName":"973 Program of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensorless SVPWM-FADTC of a New Flux-Modulated Permanent-Magnet Wheel Motor Based on a Wide-Speed Sliding Mode Observer","sourcePdf":"tie-fan-2376879-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086169S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7080969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"7080969","articleId":"6975195","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6975196,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Hung Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7081396/6975196/wei-2377121-small.gif","p":["\nChia-Hung Wei received the Ph.D. degree in electronic and computer \nengineering from National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2013.

The proposed model has considered the implementation details of the OFDMA random access procedure (such as periodic access characteristic, uniform random backoff policy, and power-ramping effect) and the effect of new arrivals. The performance metrics of collision probability, success probability, and average access delay and the cumulative distribution function of the number of preamble transmissions and access delay for the successfully accessed mobile station are then derived based on the analytical model.

The conventional adaptive scheme is shown to be a special case of the conditionally adaptive scheme technique that enables the resulting nonconvex optimization problem, which is solved in a feasible way. It leads to a solution for optimal power adaptation that maximizes the spectral efficiency of an OFDM system using M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (MQAM) under average power and instantaneous bit error rate (BER) constraints. Closed-form expressions for the average spectral efficiency (ASE) of adaptive OFDM systems are derived for perfect and imperfect CSI cases. The theoretical results and computer simulations show that range of the conditional adaptation becomes narrow and the performance of constant power and continuous rate is very close to that of the conditionally adaptive power and continuous rate for higher CFO or high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7323911/06975201.pdf","startPage":"5042","endPage":"5055","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2377153","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2377153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7323911","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6975201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Conditional Power and Rate Adaptation for MQAM/OFDM Systems Under CFO With Perfect and Imperfect Channel Estimation Errors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Bit error rate","Approximation methods","Channel estimation","Optimization","Adaptive systems","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","concave programming","error statistics","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","spectral analysis","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MQAM-OFDM system","rate adaptation","CFO","imperfect channel estimation error","perfect channel estimation error","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","carrier frequency offset","nonconvex optimization problem","M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation","bit error rate","BER constraint","average spectral efficiency","ASE","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)","Intercarrier Interference (ICI)","Conditional Power and Rate Adaptation","Average Spectral Efficiency (ASE)","Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO)"]},{"kwd":["Average spectral efficiency (ASE)","carrier frequency offset (CFO)","conditional power and rate adaptation","intercarrier interference (ICI)","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975201/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Conditional Power and Rate Adaptation for MQAM/OFDM Systems Under CFO With Perfect and Imperfect Channel Estimation Errors","volume":"64","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6975201/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15587071","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2012CB316100"},{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471302"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"111-2-14"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"SWJTU12ZT02/2682014ZT11"},{"fundingName":"2013 Doctoral Innovation Funds of Southwest Jiaotong University"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conditional Power and Rate Adaptation for MQAM/OFDM Systems Under CFO With Perfect and Imperfect Channel Estimation Errors","sourcePdf":"tvt-dong-2377153-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094379S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7323911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7323911","articleId":"6975201","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6975203,"authors":[{"name":"Ui-Min Choi","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6996060/6975203/choi-small.gif","p":["Ui-Min Choi (S\u201911) received the B.S. and M.S. degree in\n electrical and computer engineering from Ajou University, Suwon, Korea, in 2011 and 2013, respectively.

In this paper, we study a critical yet open problem for this application, i.e., the impact of wireless charging and mobility of EVs on the wholesale electricity market based on locational marginal price (LMP), which is mainly determined by the EV mobility patterns. To capture the dynamics in vehicle traffic flow and state of charge of EV batteries, we model the EV mobility as a queuing network based on the statistics obtained via traffic information systems. Then, the load on each power system bus with respect to EV wireless charging is obtained using the stationary distribution of the queuing network. An economic dispatch problem is formulated to incorporate the EV wireless charging demand, and the LMP of each power system bus is obtained. Furthermore, a pricing mechanism based on the LMP variations of power system buses is investigated to enhance the social welfare. The performance of our proposed analytical model is verified by a realistic road traffic simulator (SUMO) based on a 3-bus test system and an IEEE 30-bus test system, respectively. Simulation results indicate that our proposed analytical model can accurately provide an estimation of the LMP variations due to EV wireless charging.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2014.2376913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7080969","startPage":"3123","endPage":"3133","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7080969/06975208.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigating Wireless Charging and Mobility of Electric Vehicles on Electricity Market","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975208/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6975208/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Investigating Wireless Charging and Mobility of Electric Vehicles on Electricity Market","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15036008","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"62","issue":"5","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and in part by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigating Wireless Charging and Mobility of Electric Vehicles on Electricity Market","sourcePdf":"tie-ou-2376913-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121025S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7080969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"7080969","articleId":"6975208","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6975210,"authors":[{"name":"Bjoern H.

Twenty state-of-the-art tumor segmentation algorithms were applied to a set of 65 multi-contrast MR scans of low- and high-grade glioma patients - manually annotated by up to four raters - and to 65 comparable scans generated using tumor image simulation software. Quantitative evaluations revealed considerable disagreement between the human raters in segmenting various tumor sub-regions (Dice scores in the range 74%-85%), illustrating the difficulty of this task. We found that different algorithms worked best for different sub-regions (reaching performance comparable to human inter-rater variability), but that no single algorithm ranked in the top for all sub-regions simultaneously. Fusing several good algorithms using a hierarchical majority vote yielded segmentations that consistently ranked above all individual algorithms, indicating remaining opportunities for further methodological improvements. The BRATS image data and manual annotations continue to be publicly available through an online evaluation system as an ongoing benchmarking resource.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2014.2377694","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/7283692/06975210.pdf","startPage":"1993","endPage":"2024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7283692","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2014.2377694","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Benchmark (BRATS)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6975210","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"The Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Benchmark (BRATS)","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975210/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15489340","pubMedId":"25494501","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6975210/","volume":"34","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"The Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Benchmark (BRATS)","sourcePdf":"tmi-menze-2377694-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.381945S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"7283692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"1649","xplore-issue":"7283692","articleId":"6975210","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":6975211,"authors":[{"name":"Seyed Ali Mousavifar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7081396/6975211/mousa-2377017-small.gif","p":["\nSeyed Ali Mousavifar (S'08) received the B.A.Sc. and M.A.Sc. degrees \nfrom the Departments of ECE, University of British Columbia (UBC), Vancouver, BC, Canada, in 2006 and 2009, \nrespectively.

In this context, we derive the optimal minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR)-based successive minimum variance beamforming (SMVB) scheme that achieves a superior sum-rate performance compared with the block diagonalization scheme. Subsequently, we derive an optimal joint power allocation and broadcast beamforming scheme for multicell cooperative broadcast transmission for a pooled power constraint at the base stations. This scheme is extended to include per base station power constraints by formulating it as a relaxed semi-definite program (SDP). We also consider the multicell cooperative uplink scenario and derive a successive multiuser (MU) uplink beamforming (SMUB) scheme that maximizes the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of each user. Next, we consider imperfect channel state information (CSI) and derive a robust beamforming scheme for the downlink, based on minimizing the worst-case interference by formulating it as a second-order cone program. It is demonstrated that the corresponding robust beamformer for the uplink transmission can be derived by employing the multidimensional covariance fitting approach. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the superior sum-rate performance of the proposed multicell transmission schemes. The performance is also compared with several bounds for cooperative multicell scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2377297","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7323911/06975212.pdf","startPage":"5160","endPage":"5176","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2377297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7323911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MVDR-Based Multicell Cooperative Beamforming Techniques for Unicast/Multicast MIMO Networks With Perfect/Imperfect CSI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6975212","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975212/","displayDocTitle":"MVDR-Based Multicell Cooperative Beamforming Techniques for Unicast/Multicast MIMO Networks With Perfect/Imperfect CSI","volume":"64","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15587070","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6975212/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"TCS Research Scholarship Program, Department of Science and Technology (DST) India under the IU-ATC Project in Next Generation Networks","grantNumber":"DST/EE/20120275"},{"fundingName":"IIMA-IDEA Telecom Center of Excellence","grantNumber":"IITCOE/EE/20120301"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MVDR-Based Multicell Cooperative Beamforming Techniques for Unicast/Multicast MIMO Networks With Perfect/Imperfect CSI","sourcePdf":"tvt-venkategowda-2377297-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109135S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7323911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7323911","articleId":"6975212","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6975213,"authors":[{"name":"Sangheon Pack","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7323911/6975213/pack-2377047-small.gif","p":["\n\nSangheon Pack (S'02\u2013M'05\u2013SM'11) received the B.S.

In the case of dc systems, stability can be predicted by examining the locus described by the ratio of the source and load impedances in the complex plane per the Nyquist stability criterion. For balanced three-phase ac systems the same impedance-based method applies, for which this paper uses impedances in the synchronous rotating reference (d-q) frame. Small-signal stability can be determined by applying the generalized Nyquist stability criterion (GNC). This approach relies on the actual measurement of these impedances, which up to now has severely hindered its applicability. Addressing this shortcoming, this paper investigates the small-signal stability of a three-phase ac system using measured d-q frame impedances. The results obtained show how the stability at the ac interface can be easily and readily predicted using the measured impedances and the GNC, thus illustrating the practicality of the approach, and validating the use of ac impedances as a valuable dynamic analysis tool for ac system integration, in perfect dualism with the dc case.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2014.2378731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2014.2378731","startPage":"5952","endPage":"5963","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7112252/06975228.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7112252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Small-Signal Stability Analysis of Three-Phase AC Systems in the Presence of Constant Power Loads Based on Measured <i>d-q</i> Frame Impedances","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975228/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Small-Signal Stability Analysis of Three-Phase AC Systems in the Presence of Constant Power Loads Based on Measured <i>d-q</i> Frame Impedances","volume":"30","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15144566","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6975228/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000003","fundingName":"Boeing"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small-Signal Stability Analysis of Three-Phase AC Systems in the Presence of Constant Power Loads Based on Measured <italic>d-q</italic> Frame Impedances","sourcePdf":"tpel-wen-2378731-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120395S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7112252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"207","xplore-issue":"7112252","articleId":"6975228","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6975233,"authors":[{"name":"Naveen Goela","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA","School of Computer and Communication Sciences, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"p":["Naveen Goela received undergraduate degrees both in computer science and mathematics, and a M.Eng. degree in computer science on the topic of multicamera visual hull reconstruction in 2004, all from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

For m-user deterministic broadcast channels, polarization is applied to map uniformly random message bits from m-independent messages to one codeword while satisfying broadcast constraints. The polarization-based codes achieve rates on the boundary of the private-message capacity region. For two-user noisy broadcast channels, polar implementations are presented for two information-theoretic schemes: 1) Cover's superposition codes and 2) Marton's codes. Due to the structure of polarization, constraints on the auxiliary and channel-input distributions are identified to ensure proper alignment of polarization indices in the multiuser setting. The codes achieve rates on the capacity boundary of a few classes of broadcast channels (e.g., binary-input stochastically degraded). The complexity of encoding and decoding is O(n log n), where n is the block length.

Patches of edges exhibit well-known forms of local structure, such as straight lines or T-junctions. In this paper we take advantage of the structure present in local image patches to learn both an accurate and computationally efficient edge detector. We formulate the problem of predicting local edge masks in a structured learning framework applied to random decision forests. Our novel approach to learning decision trees robustly maps the structured labels to a discrete space on which standard information gain measures may be evaluated. The result is an approach that obtains realtime performance that is orders of magnitude faster than many competing state-of-the-art approaches, while also achieving state-of-the-art edge detection results on the BSDS500 Segmentation dataset and NYU Depth dataset. Finally, we show the potential of our approach as a general purpose edge detector by showing our learned edge models generalize well across datasets.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2377715","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/7140864/06975234.pdf","startPage":"1558","endPage":"1570","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2377715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7140864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Edge Detection Using Structured Forests","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6975234","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975234/","displayDocTitle":"Fast Edge Detection Using Structured Forests","volume":"37","issue":"8","publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15258473","pubMedId":"26352995","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6975234/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Edge Detection Using Structured Forests","sourcePdf":"tpami-dollar-2377715-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154457S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"7140864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"455","xplore-issue":"7140864","articleId":"6975234","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6975237,"authors":[{"name":"Abhilash Kamineni","affiliation":["Power Electronics Research Group, Auckland, New Zealand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7154538/6975237/kamin-small.gif","p":["Abhilash Kamineni (S\u201910) received the B.E.

Several coil designs are simulated and a mathematical model is developed to evaluate the efficiency of parallel-parallel and series-series tuned systems. As shown a coplanar, independently tuned intermediate coupler coil improves the efficiency of a series-series-tuned system since it reduces source losses. However, there appears to be no benefit to having an intermediate coupler with a parallel-parallel-tuned system. Furthermore, boosts in coupling are a result of adding extra current carrying windings to the primary pad and simulations show that operating the system as a traditional two coil IPT system may be simpler and more effective based on tuning topology.

Despite the wide variety of methods that have been proposed for this problem, none has been able to fully address the complex nature of dynamic scenes in real surveillance tasks. In this paper, we present a universal pixel-level segmentation method that relies on spatiotemporal binary features as well as color information to detect changes. This allows camouflaged foreground objects to be detected more easily while most illumination variations are ignored. Besides, instead of using manually set, frame-wide constants to dictate model sensitivity and adaptation speed, we use pixel-level feedback loops to dynamically adjust our method's internal parameters without user intervention. These adjustments are based on the continuous monitoring of model fidelity and local segmentation noise levels. This new approach enables us to outperform all 32 previously tested state-of-the-art methods on the 2012 and 2014 versions of the ChangeDetection.net dataset in terms of overall F-Measure. The use of local binary image descriptors for pixel-level modeling also facilitates high-speed parallel implementations: our own version, which used no low-level or architecture-specific instruction, reached real-time processing speed on a midlevel desktop CPU. A complete C++ implementation based on OpenCV is available online.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/6978084/06975239.pdf","startPage":"359","endPage":"373","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2014.2378053","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2014.2378053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6978084","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6975239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SuBSENSE: A Universal Change Detection Method With Local Adaptive Sensitivity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptation models","Noise","Image color analysis","Sensitivity","Lighting","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Color"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","image segmentation","image sequences","object detection","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SuBSENSE","universal change detection method","local adaptive sensitivity","foreground-background segmentation","video sequences","universal pixel-level segmentation method","spatiotemporal binary features","color information","illumination variations","manually set frame-wide constants","adaptation speed","pixel-level feedback loops","model fidelity continuous monitoring","local segmentation noise levels","F-measure","ChangeDetection.net dataset","local binary image descriptors","midlevel desktop CPU","C++","OpenCV"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["background subtraction","change detection","foreground segmentation","surveillance","spatiotemporal features","video signal processing"]},{"kwd":["Background subtraction","change detection","foreground segmentation","surveillance","spatiotemporal features","video signal processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975239/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"SuBSENSE: A Universal Change Detection Method With Local Adaptive Sensitivity","volume":"24","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6975239/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"14817588","pubMedId":"25494507","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fonds de Recherche du Qu\u00e9bec\u2014Nature et Technologies (FRQNT)","grantNumber":"2014-PR-172083"},{"fundingName":"Regroupement pour l\u2019\u00e9tude des environnements partag\u00e9s intelligents r\u00e9partis FRQ-NT strategic cluster"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SuBSENSE: A Universal Change Detection Method With Local Adaptive Sensitivity","sourcePdf":"tip-stcharles-2378053-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117363S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6978084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"374","xplore-issue":"6978084","articleId":"6975239","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6975243,"authors":[{"name":"Mou Chen","affiliation":["College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7206790/6975243/chen-2360933-small.gif","p":["Mou Chen (M\u201910) received the B.Sc. degree in material science and engineering, and the M.Sc. degree and the Ph.D. degree in automatic control engineering from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 1998 and 2004, respectively.","He was an Academic Visitor with the Department of Aeronautical and Automotive Engineering, Loughborough University, Leicester, U.K., from 2007 to 2008, and a Research Fellow with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, from 2008 to 2009.

The radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is employed to approximate the unknown system function. To efficiently tackle the unknown external disturbance, a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) is developed. The developed NDO can relax the known boundary requirement of the unknown disturbance and can guarantee the disturbance estimation error converge to a bounded compact set. Using NDO and RBFNN, the DSC scheme is developed for uncertain nonlinear systems based on a backstepping method. Using a DSC technique, the problem of explosion of complexity inherent in the conventional backstepping method is avoided, which is specially important for designs using neural network approximations. Under the proposed DSC scheme, the ultimately bounded convergence of all closed-loop signals is guaranteed via Lyapunov analysis. Simulation results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed DSC design using NDO and RBFNN.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7206790/06975243.pdf","startPage":"2086","endPage":"2097","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2360933","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2360933","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7206790","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6975243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Surface Control Using Neural Networks for a Class of Uncertain Nonlinear Systems With Input Saturation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear systems","Backstepping","Adaptive systems","Artificial neural networks","Observers","Robustness","Control design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control nonlinearities","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","observers","radial basis function networks","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic surface control","uncertain strict-feedback nonlinear systems","input saturation","radial basis function neural network","nonlinear disturbance observer","NDO","disturbance estimation error","RBFNN","DSC","backstepping method","ultimately bounded convergence","closed-loop signals","Lyapunov analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Backstepping control","dynamic surface control (DSC)","nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO)","robust control","uncertain nonlinear system."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Computer Simulation","Feedback","Humans","Neural Networks (Computer)","Nonlinear Dynamics","Uncertainty"]},{"kwd":["Backstepping control","dynamic surface control (DSC)","nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO)","robust control","uncertain nonlinear system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975243/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Surface Control Using Neural Networks for a Class of Uncertain Nonlinear Systems With Input Saturation","volume":"26","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6975243/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15414246","pubMedId":"25494515","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"SBK20130033"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61374130 and 61174102"},{"fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in the University of China","grantNumber":"NCET-11-0830"},{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Province Blue Project through the Innovative Research Team"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Surface Control Using Neural Networks for a Class of Uncertain Nonlinear Systems With Input Saturation","sourcePdf":"tnnls-chen-2360933-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116816S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7206790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"258","xplore-issue":"7206790","articleId":"6975243","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6975250,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Price","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6998099/6975250/6975250-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michael Price (S'12) received the M.Eng. degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA, USA, in 2009 for work on high-speed serial links in cooperation with Analog Devices.

With a limited amount of testing resource available, testing resource allocation among components of a software system becomes an important issue. Most existing research on the testing resource allocation problem takes a single-objective optimization approach, which may not adequately address all the concerns in the decision-making process. In this paper, an architecture-based multi-objective optimization approach to testing resource allocation is proposed. An architecture-based model is used for system reliability assessment, which has the advantage of explicitly considering system architecture over the reliability block diagram (RBD)-based models, and has good flexibility to different architectural alternatives and component changes. A system cost modeling approach which is based on well-developed software cost models is proposed, which would be a more flexible, suitable approach to the cost modeling of software than the approach adopted by others which is based on an empirical cost model. A multi-objective optimization model is developed for the testing resource allocation problem, in which the three major concerns in the testing resource allocation problem, i.e., system reliability, system cost, and the total amount of testing resource consumed, are taken into consideration. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), called multi-objective differential evolution based on weighted normalized sum (WNS-MODE), is developed. Experimental studies are presented, and the experiments show several results. 1) The proposed architecture-based multi-objective optimization approach can identify the testing resource allocation strategy which has a good trade-off among optimization objectives. 2) The developed WNS-MODE is better than the MOEA developed in recent research, called HaD-MOEA, in terms of both solution quality and computational efficiency. 3) The WNS-MODE seems quite robust from the sensitivity analysis results.","doi":"10.1109/TR.2014.2372411","startPage":"497","endPage":"515","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel7/24/7051309/06975258.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.2014.2372411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7051309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Architecture-Based Multi-Objective Optimization Approach to Testing Resource Allocation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Resource management","Software","Software reliability","Optimization","Object oriented modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","program testing","resource allocation","sensitivity analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensitivity analysis","weighted normalized sum","WNS-MODE","multiobjective differential evolution","multiobjective evolutionary algorithm","system cost modeling approach","system reliability assessment","reliability block diagram","RBD-based model","single-objective optimization approach","software system","resource allocation testing","architecture-based multiobjective optimization approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hyper-volume indicator","multi-objective evolutionary algorithm","software architecture","software cost models","system reliability assessment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975258/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","displayDocTitle":"An Architecture-Based Multi-Objective Optimization Approach to Testing Resource Allocation","volume":"64","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6975258/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2015","accessionNumber":"14948495","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Architecture-Based Multi-Objective Optimization Approach to Testing Resource Allocation","sourcePdf":"tr-yang-2372411-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.260457S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"24","isNumber":"7051309","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7051309","articleId":"6975258","onlineDate":"04 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6975290,"authors":[{"name":"Michael T McCann","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University"],"bio":{"p":["Michael T.

It is a critical component in diagnostic medicine and a tool for studying the pathogenesis and biology of processes such as cancer and embryogenesis. Tissue processing for histology has become increasingly automated, drastically increasing the speed at which histology labs can produce tissue slides for viewing. Another trend is the digitization of these slides, allowing them to be viewed on a computer rather than through a microscope. Despite these changes, much of the routine analysis of tissue sections remains a painstaking, manual task that can only be completed by highly trained pathologists at a high cost per hour. There is, therefore, a niche for image analysis methods that can automate some aspects of this analysis. These methods could also automate tasks that are prohibitively time-consuming for humans, e.g., discovering new disease markers from hundreds of whole-slide images (WSIs) or precisely quantifying tissues within a tumor.","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2014.2346443","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/79/6975276/06975290.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2014.2346443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6975276","startPage":"78","endPage":"87","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Histology Analysis: Opportunities for signal processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6975290","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automated Histology Analysis: Opportunities for signal processing","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975290/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"32","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"14807110","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6975290/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Histology Analysis: Opportunities for signal processing","sourcePdf":"32msp01-mccann-2346443-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110963S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"6975276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6975276","articleId":"6975290","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6975296,"authors":[{"name":"Pouyan Mohajerani","affiliation":["Institute for Biological and Medical Imaging, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Pouyan Mohajerani (pouyan.mohajerani@gmail.com) received the B.Sc. degree in 2001 from Sharif University of Technology, Iran, the M.Sc. degree in 2004 from the Georgia Institute of Technology, United States, and the Ph.D. degree in 2014 from Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany, all in electrical engineering.

This type of systems can benefit from the resource provisioningtechnology offered by the cloud computing. In fact, the latteroffers on-demand virtualized resources to its users. These virtualresources can be added and released dynamically. Also, usersare charged on a pay-per-use basis. How to make appropriatedecisions when allocating resources to the tasks and dispatchingthe computing tasks to resource pool has become the main issuein cloud computing. The amount of allocated resources affects theexecution time of the applications and the cost incurred by the user. In fact, resource under-provisioning will necessarily affectthe performance. In contrast, over-provisioning can result in idleinstances and cause additional costs. Then, efficient scheduling algorithms are required for selection of best suitable resources for task execution. This paper focuses on some of the important workflow scheduling strategies. It brings out an exhaustive survey of such strategies in cloud computing and includes a detailed classification of them. Then, it presents a comparative analysis of the studied approaches. Finally, it stands out a critical challenge for further research.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975385/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14795310","htmlLink":"/document/6975385/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","conferenceDate":"1-2 Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Workflow Scheduling in Cloud Computing: A Survey","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Workflow Scheduling in Cloud Computing: A Survey","confLoc":"Ulm, Germany","sourcePdf":"5467a372.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110293S","chronDate":"1-2 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971861","isNumber":"6975303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971861","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6975303","articleId":"6975385","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6975480,"authors":[{"name":"Chien Min Wu","affiliation":["Dept. of computer science of information engineering, Nanhua University, Chiayi, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Chien Min","lastName":"Wu","id":"37276429400"},{"name":"Hui Kai Su","affiliation":["Dept. of electrical engineering, National Formosa University, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Hui Kai","lastName":"Su","id":"37280810700"},{"name":"Maw Lin Leou","affiliation":["Dept. of computer science of information engineering, Nanhua University, Chiayi, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Maw Lin","lastName":"Leou","id":"37085348793"},{"name":"Yi Ching Liaw","affiliation":["Dept. of computer science of information engineering, Nanhua University, Chiayi, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Yi Ching","lastName":"Liaw","id":"37269314400"},{"name":"Chih Pin Lo","affiliation":["Dept. of computer science of information engineering, Nanhua University, Chiayi, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Chih Pin","lastName":"Lo","id":"37085361435"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4331-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-4333-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6975480","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ad hoc networks","Cognitive radio","Monitoring","Media Access Protocol","IEEE 802.11 Standards","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","interference suppression","radiofrequency interference","radiowave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative power-contention control MAC protocol","multichannel cognitive radio ad hoc networks","CPC-MAC protocol","multichannel hidden terminal primary user problem","multichannel hidden terminal PU problem","monitor nodes","secondary user transmitter","SU transmitter","RTS frame","transmission power","SU receiver","CTS frame","receiving power","SU sender","position estimation","deterministic propagation model","interference reduction","hidden PU terminal","interrupt frame","control channel","one-hop SU neighbors","IEEE 802.11 DCF","ns2 simulation tool","energy consumption reduction","system throughput"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio ad hoc network","MAC","hidden terminal problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6975480","doi":"10.1109/IMIS.2014.39","publicationTitle":"2014 Eighth International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing","abstract":"In this paper, we will propose a Cooperative Power and Contention control MAC (CPC-MAC) protocol in Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks to solve the multichannel hidden terminal Primary User (PU) problem by build appropriate number of monitor nodes in suitable positions. There are two functions in this mechanism. First, secondary user (SU) transmitter sends the RTS frame including transmission power to SU receiver, SU receiver sends CTS frame including receiving power to SU sender. Monitor nodes send position and receiving power to SU sender and SU receiver. SU transmitter selects three monitors that their receiving powers are approach to each other. SU transmitter estimates its position and sending power by deterministic propagation model. This will reduce the interference to hidden PU terminal. Second, the SU in the transmission range of the PU will send one highest priority interrupt frame in control channel to one-hop SU neighbors to protect the PU. We also compare our proposed scheme to the existing IEEE 802.11 DCF and the other MAC protocols in Cognitive Radio ad hoc networks using ns2 simulation tool. We will show that CPC-MAC will improve the system throughput and reduce the energy consumption.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMIS.2014.39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6975399","startPage":"305","endPage":"309","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Eighth International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963207/6975399/06975480.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Power and Contention Control MAC Protocol in Multichannel Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975480/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 July 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6975480/","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Power and Contention Control MAC Protocol in Multichannel Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14794605","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Power and Contention Control MAC Protocol in Multichannel Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Birmingham, UK","sourcePdf":"4331a305.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08905S","chronDate":"2-4 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963207","isNumber":"6975399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963207","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6975399","articleId":"6975480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6975571,"authors":[{"name":"Yongpeng Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin"],"firstName":"Yongpeng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085423813"},{"name":"Monisha Manoharan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin"],"firstName":"Monisha","lastName":"Manoharan","id":"37085426531"},{"name":"K.

Identity theft is often a \"gateway\" crime, as criminals use stolen or fraudulent identities to steal money, claim eligibility for services, hack into networks without authorization, and so on. The available data describing identity crimes and their aftermath is often in the form of recorded stories and reports by the news press, fraud examiners, and law enforcement. All of these sources are unstructured. Hence, in order to analyze identity theft data, this research proposes an approach which involves the collection of online news stories and reports on the topic of identity theft. Our approach preprocesses the raw text and extracts semi-structured information automatically, using text mining techniques. This paper presents statistical analysis of behavioral patterns and resources used by thieves and fraudsters to commit identity theft, including the identity attributes commonly linked to identity crimes, resources thieves employ to conduct identity crimes, and temporal patterns of criminal behavior. Analyses of these results increase empirical understanding of identity threat behaviors, offer early warning signs of identity theft, and thwart future identity theft crimes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Joint Intelligence and Security Informatics Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968676/6975536/06975571.pdf","startPage":"184","endPage":"191","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Joint Intelligence and Security Informatics Conference","doi":"10.1109/JISIC.2014.35","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JISIC.2014.35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6975536","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6975571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling and Analysis of Identity Threat Behaviors through Text Mining of Identity Theft Stories","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Text mining","Government","Security","Internet","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","data mining","police data processing","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["identity threat behavior","text mining","identity theft stories","gateway crime","theft data analysis","semistructured information extraction","criminal behavior"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["identity theft","text mining","news stories","PII attribute"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975571/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Modelling and Analysis of Identity Threat Behaviors through Text Mining of Identity Theft Stories","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6975571/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14795018","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling and Analysis of Identity Threat Behaviors through Text Mining of Identity Theft Stories","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"6364a184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060954S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968676","isNumber":"6975536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968676","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6975536","articleId":"6975571","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6975572,"authors":[{"name":"Hamed Yaghoubi Shahir","affiliation":["Software Technology Lab, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Hamed Yaghoubi","lastName":"Shahir","id":"37681952500"},{"name":"Uwe Gl\u00e4sser","affiliation":["Software Technology Lab, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Uwe","lastName":"Gl\u00e4sser","id":"37284241900"},{"name":"Narek Nalbandyan","affiliation":["Software Technology Lab, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Narek","lastName":"Nalbandyan","id":"38466426200"},{"name":"Hans Wehn","affiliation":["Software Technology Lab, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Hans","lastName":"Wehn","id":"37265668400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6364-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6363-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6975572","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":405},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Feature extraction","Kinematics","Trajectory","Security","Cognition","Marine vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","military computing","security of data","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maritime situation analysis","multivessel interaction","anomaly detection framework","maritime security","sea lanes","ports","harbors","intelligent systems","interaction patterns","hidden Markov model","data fusion","geospatial aspects","kinematic features","contextual information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Maritime Safety & Security","Interactive Situation Analysis","Anomaly Detection","Intelligent Systems","Decision Support"]}],"abstract":"Maritime security is critical for protecting sea lanes, ports, harborsand other critical infrastructure against a broad range of threats and illegal activities like smuggling, human trafficking, piracy and terrorism.

In this paper, we propose a novel situation analysis approach to analyze, detect and differentiate a range of interaction patterns and anomalies of interest for marine vessels that operate over some period of time in relative proximity to each other. We analyze vessel interaction scenarios to model common patterns as probabilistic processes in terms of hidden Markov models. To differentiate suspicious activities from unobjectionable behavior, we explore fusion of data and information from observable behavior (geospatial aspects, kinematic features and contextual information) and maritime domain knowledge from diverse sources.

However, the unpredictable context in which the system runs and daily emergence of new software threats makes it extremely challenging to diagnose anomalies using current tools. Host-based anomaly detection techniques can facilitate the diagnosis of unknown anomalies but there is no common platform with the implementation of such techniques. In this paper, we propose an automated anomaly detection framework (Total ADS) that automatically trains different anomaly detection techniques on a normal trace stream from a software system, raise anomalous alarms on suspicious behaviour in streams of trace data, and uses visualization to facilitate the analysis of the cause of the anomalies. Total ADS is an extensible Eclipse-based open source framework that employs a common trace format to use different types of traces, a common interface to adapt to a variety of anomaly detection techniques (e.g., HMM, sequence matching, etc.). Our case study on a modern Linux server shows that Total ADS automatically detects attacks on the server, shows anomalous paths in traces, and provides forensic insights.","doi":"10.1109/SCAM.2014.37","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 14th International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 14th International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6970367/6975619/06975641.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"88","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCAM.2014.37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6975619","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Total ADS: Automated Software Anomaly Detection System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6975641","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975641/","displayDocTitle":"Total ADS: Automated Software Anomaly Detection System","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14795181","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6975641/","conferenceDate":"28-29 Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Total ADS: Automated Software Anomaly Detection System","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"6148a083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083869S","chronDate":"28-29 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6970367","isNumber":"6975619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6970367","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6975619","articleId":"6975641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6975662,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Masudur Rahman","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Saskatchewan, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohammad Masudur","lastName":"Rahman","id":"37085473999"},{"name":"Chanchal K.

In this paper, we propose a context-aware code recommendation approach that recommends exception handling code examples from a number of popular open source code repositories hosted at GitHub. It collects the code examples exploiting GitHub code search API, and then analyzes, filters and ranks them against the code under development in the IDE by leveraging not only the structural (i.e., graph-based) and lexical features but also the heuristic quality measures of exception handlers in the examples. Experiments with 4,400 code examples and 65 exception handling scenarios as well as comparisons with four existing approaches show that the proposed approach is highly promising.","doi":"10.1109/SCAM.2014.15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCAM.2014.15","startPage":"285","endPage":"294","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 14th International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6970367/6975619/06975662.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 14th International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6975619","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Use of Context in Recommending Exception Handling Code Examples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"On the Use of Context in Recommending Exception Handling Code Examples","conferenceDate":"28-29 Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6975662/","accessionNumber":"14795182","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975662/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Use of Context in Recommending Exception Handling Code Examples","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"6148a285.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085613S","chronDate":"28-29 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6970367","isNumber":"6975619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6970367","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6975619","articleId":"6975662","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6975800,"authors":[{"name":"Ha Hyoung-uk","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Ha","lastName":"Hyoung-uk","id":"37085514939"},{"name":"Jong-Kook Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Kook","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085430678"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5151-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5150-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"}],"articleNumber":"6975800","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6975800","abstract":"Many problems are now being solved using a version of a neural network (NN). These NN are usually constructed using genetic neural networks (GNNs) for optimizing variables in the NN using a fixed structure or neural evolution (NE) to optimize the structure of the NN using fixed values for the variables in the NN. Thus, previous methods need experienced knowledge of the problem such that either the structure or variables are known to construct a meaningful NN. This paper presents a method called leap evolution adopted neural network (LEANN) that optimizes the NN without prior knowledge such as the values of the variables and the structure of the NN for a given problem. Our method in this paper finds an optimal structure and variables of the NN successfully for the XOR gate problem.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2014.6975800","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 10th International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963214/6975799/06975800.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 10th International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2014.6975800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6975799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An evolutionary genetic neural networks for problems without prior knowledge","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Genetic algorithms","Biological neural networks","Genetics","Logic gates","Sociology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary genetic neural networks","genetic neural networks","GNN","fixed structure","neural evolution","leap evolution adopted neural network","LEANN","XOR gate problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["genetic neural network","neuro-evolution","multilayer perceptron","genetic algorithm","evolutionary algorithm","bio-inspired algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975800/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"An evolutionary genetic neural networks for problems without prior knowledge","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6975800/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","conferenceDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14808255","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An evolutionary genetic neural networks for problems without prior knowledge","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064265S","chronDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963214","isNumber":"6975799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963214","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6975799","articleId":"6975800","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6975806,"authors":[{"name":"Cong Zhan","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University, Wuhan, PR, China"],"firstName":"Cong","lastName":"Zhan","id":"37085530218"},{"name":"Shihua Chen","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University, Wuhan, PR, China"],"firstName":"Shihua","lastName":"Chen","id":"37403390400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5151-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5150-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"}],"articleNumber":"6975806","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Asymptotic stability","Biological neural networks","Delays","Delay effects","Stability criteria"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","delays","neural nets","numerical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global asymptotic stability analysis","Cohen-Grossberg neural networks","time delays","numerical simulation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6975806","abstract":"This paper further discusses the global asymptotic stability of Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with time delays.

The new model combines the advantages of linear neural network including fast convergence, no existence of local minimum value, high precision and easy operation. It maps the linear neural network into complex network. Through statistics and comparison of network parameters, the differentially expressed genes related to the sample background can be identified.

In this paper, a DNN-based speech recognizer is implemented on an embedded platform. To reduce model size and computation cost, the DNN model is converted from float-point to fixed-point and NEON instructions are applied. The speed is further improved as a result of the downsizing of the DNN model via singular value decomposition (SVD) reconstruction.

When the speed of decoding or indexing is critical, it seems to be a trade-off between the performance and the speed to utilize DNN in keyword verification. Inspired by the utilization and acceleration of DNN in the decoding stage, we explored an efficient method to replace GMM by DNN in the verification stage. 5% relative reduction of equal error rate (EER) is achieved and the improvement of recall in the high precision region is especially significant, which is essential to practical tasks.

Elman recurrent neural network model for forecasting consumer price index of education, recreation and sports in Yogyakarta","abstract":"Recurrent neural network is a network which provides feedback connections. This network is believed to have a more powerful approach than the typical neural network for learning given data. The current research was aimed to apply the simplest recurrent neural network model, namely the Elman recurrent neural network (ERNN) model, to the consumer price index (CPI) of education, recreation, and sports data in Yogyakarta. The pattern of CPI data can be categorized as a function of time period, which tends to move upwards when the time period is increased, and jump at some points of the time period. This pattern was identified as similar to the pattern resulted by the function of the truncated polynomial spline regression model (TPSR). Hence, this research considered ERNN model which the inputs such as in the TPSR model were established by taking into account the location of the knot or jump points. In addition, the ERNN model with a single input, a time period was also generated. The results demonstrated that the two models have high accuracy both in training and testing data. More importantly, it was found that the first model is more appropriate than the second one in testing data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975833/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14808235","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6975833/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","conferenceDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The application of Elman recurrent neural network model for forecasting consumer price index of education, recreation and sports in Yogyakarta","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The application of Elman recurrent neural network model for forecasting consumer price index of education, recreation and sports in Yogyakarta","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"a034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049645S","chronDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963214","isNumber":"6975799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963214","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6975799","articleId":"6975833","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6975836,"authors":[{"name":"Zuyuan Yang","affiliation":["School of Automatic Control and Mechanical Engineering, Kunming University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Zuyuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085515907"},{"name":"You Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Qujing Normal College, Qujing, China"],"firstName":"You","lastName":"Yang","id":"37656804400"},{"name":"Huafen Yang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Chongqing Normal University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Huafen","lastName":"Yang","id":"37856098500"},{"name":"Lihui Zhang","affiliation":["Metallurgy college of logistics, Kunming normal college Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Lihui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38251998400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5151-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5150-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"}],"articleNumber":"6975836","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Chaos","Convergence","Sociology","Statistics","Educational institutions","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","evolutionary computation","particle swarm optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaotic maps","parameter adaptation","performance enhancement","evolutionary computation technique","population cooperation","population competition","individual improvement","modified particle swarm optimization algorithm","CPSO","diversity measure method","exploration abilities","exploitation abilities","chaotic searching strategy","local optimum","GA","search efficiency enhancement","search quality improvement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","chaos maps","population diversity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6975836","abstract":"This paper proposes a new particle swarm optimization method that use chaotic maps for parameter adaptation.

adaptive mutation particle swarm optimization","abstract":"Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has attracted great attention as a stochastic optimizing method due to its simplicity and power strength in optimization fields. However, two issues are still to be improved, especially, for complex multimodal problems. One is the premature convergence for multimodal problems. The other is the low efficiency for complex problems. To address these two issues, firstly, a strategy based on the global optimum prediction is proposed. A predicting model is established on the low-dimensional feature space with the principle component analysis technique, which has the ability to predict the global optimal position by the feature reflecting the evolution tendency of the current swarm. Then the predicted position is used as a guideline exemplar of the evolution process together with pbest and gbest. Secondly, a strategy, called adaptive mutation, is proposed, which can evaluate the crowding level of the aggregating particle swarm by using the distribution topology of each dimension, and hence, can get the possible location of local optimums and escape from the valleys with the generalized non-uniform mutation operator subsequently. The performance of the proposed global prediction-based adaptive mutation particle swarm optimization (GPAM-PSO) is tested on 8 well-known benchmark problems, compared with 9 existing PSO in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate that GPAM-PSO outperforms all reference PSO algorithms on both the solution quality and convergence speed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975846/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14808296","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6975846/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","conferenceDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Global prediction-based adaptive mutation particle swarm optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global prediction-based adaptive mutation particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"a047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107302S","chronDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963214","isNumber":"6975799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963214","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6975799","articleId":"6975846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6975848,"authors":[{"name":"Juan Lin","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Fuqing Branch of Fujian Normal University, Fuqing, China"],"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085533699"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5151-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5150-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"}],"articleNumber":"6975848","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustics","Sociology","Statistics","Mathematical model","Numerical models","Equations","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic radiators","inverse problems","numerical analysis","particle swarm optimisation","stochastic processes","stochastic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","acoustic source localization","numerical scheme","inverse source problem","PSO","population-based stochastic optimization method","ASL"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6975848","abstract":"This paper is concerned with a numerical scheme to the inverse source problem, called Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO), which is a population-based stochastic optimization method.

of a network. According to the premature convergence of traditional genetic algorithm on community detection, this paper proposes a new coding scheme based on the attribute partition of edges. The new strategy is named as NGACD. Each nonzero gene in the NGACD represents the attribute partition between two nodes. Based on the novel coding scheme, NGACD is feasible for crossover and mutation operations. Specifically, the NGACD is independent of the context and exhibits the more features of modularity. Four benchmark network are used to estimate the efficiency of proposed strategy. The simulation results show that our algorithm is more accurate and stable than others.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975883/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14794727","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6975883/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","conferenceDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A community clustering algorithm based on genetic algorithm with novel coding scheme","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A community clustering algorithm based on genetic algorithm with novel coding scheme","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"a084.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051231S","chronDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963214","isNumber":"6975799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963214","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6975799","articleId":"6975883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6975889,"authors":[{"name":"Yunxiao Jiang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Electronic Restriction of AnHui Province, Electronic Engineering Institute, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Yunxiao","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37558429300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5151-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5150-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"}],"articleNumber":"6975889","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6975889","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Multiuser detection","Chaos","Multiaccess communication","Biological neural networks","Recurrent neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","code division multiple access","multiuser detection","simulated annealing","telecommunication computing","wavelet neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sub-optimal multiuser detector","CDMA system","improved transiently chaotic neural network","wavelet function","activation function","MUD problem","chaotic simulated annealing parameters","recurrent neural network","network evolving behavior","ITCNN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiuser","wavelet","chaotic neural network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2014.6975889","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963214/6975799/06975889.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 10th International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 10th International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC)","startPage":"520","endPage":"523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6975799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2014.6975889","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sub-optimal multiuser detector using an improved transiently chaotic neural network","abstract":"This paper proposes a sub-optimal multiuser detector (MUD) algorithm for CDMA system based on an improved transiently chaotic neural network (ITCNN) which introduces a wavelet function into the activation function of the transiently chaotic neural network, and gives a concrete model of the MUD after appropriate transformations and mappings.

An improved annealing schedule is introduced to enhance the performance of particle swarm optimization. The cooling rate is higher at the beginning than at the end of the search process. In this way, the algorithm can explore for solutions in more paths, increasing the probability that the global optima is found. At the same time, particle swarm-based-simulated annealing method introduces the SA metropolis acceptance rule. The metropolis determines whether to accept the new position or recalculate another candidate position according to the fitness function difference between the new and old positions. This enables the solution to jump out of local optimal value, and the vibration is decreased when the searching process is near the end. Experiment results and comparisons with the standard PSO and SA show that the IPSO-B-SA can effectively enhance the searching efficiency and greatly improve the searching quality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975891/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14808229","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6975891/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","conferenceDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An improved particle swarm optimization algorithm based on simulated annealing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved particle swarm optimization algorithm based on simulated annealing","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"a092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067068S","chronDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963214","isNumber":"6975799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963214","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6975799","articleId":"6975891","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6975897,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Space Mechanics and Electricity, Beijing, P.R.

Second, the two images are triangulated with position constraints. Third, Genetic algorithm is applied to optimize the similarity measure based on the absolute orientation technique together with the position constraints. The object function is based on the similarity measure on corresponding pairs of triangles in the meshes. Finally, the registered meshes are used to obtain the image registration.

In this paper, an improved genetic algorithm (GA) based on the particle swarm algorithm (PSO) is developed for matching optimization of ship engine propeller and net. Based on ship theory, the matching performance of ship engine propeller and net is analyzed. Considering the angular speed, picth ratio and disk ratio of propeller, a mathematical model is constructed in which the open-water propeller efficiency is taken as the objective function for matching optimization of ship engine propeller and net. The improved GA is presented to solve it, in which the PSO operator is introduced to the GA for the diversity of populations. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated by a matching optimization example of ship engine propeller and net for the trawler.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2014.6975906","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963214/6975799/06975906.pdf","startPage":"617","endPage":"621","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 10th International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC)","publicationTitle":"2014 10th International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2014.6975906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6975799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matching optimization of ship engine propeller and net for the trawler based on genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975906/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Matching optimization of ship engine propeller and net for the trawler based on genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14794730","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6975906/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matching optimization of ship engine propeller and net for the trawler based on genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"a108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042912S","chronDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963214","isNumber":"6975799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963214","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6975799","articleId":"6975906","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6975918,"authors":[{"name":"Charissa Ann Ronao","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Charissa Ann","lastName":"Ronao","id":"37085485633"},{"name":"Sung-Bae Cho","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-Bae","lastName":"Cho","id":"37085341531"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5151-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5150-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"}],"articleNumber":"6975918","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Accelerometers","Radio frequency","Legged locomotion","Feature extraction","Sensors","Gyroscopes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","pattern classification","smart phones","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human activity recognition","smartphone sensors","two-stage continuous hidden Markov models","temporal streams","time-series sensory data","complex activities","two-stage continuous hidden Markov model","CHMM approach","random forests variable","RF variable"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["continuous hidden Markov model","random forests","activity recognition","smartphone"]}],"abstract":"Recognizing human activities from temporal streams of sensory data observations is a very important task on a wide variety of applications in context recognition. Especially for time-series sensory data, a method that takes into account the inherent sequential characteristics of the data is needed. Moreover, activities are hierarchical in nature, in as much that complex activities can be decomposed to a number of simpler ones. In this paper, we propose a two-stage continuous hidden Markov model (CHMM) approach for the task of activity recognition using accelerometer and gyroscope sensory data gathered from a smartphone. The proposed method consists of first-level CHMMs for coarse classification, which separates stationary and moving activities, and second-level CHMMs for fine classification, which classifies the data into their corresponding activity classes. Random Forests (RF) variable importance measures are exploited to determine the optimal feature subsets for both coarse and fine classification. Experiments show that with the use of a significantly reduced number of features, the proposed method shows competitive performance in comparison to other classification algorithms, achieving an over-all accuracy of 91.76%.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2014.6975918","publicationTitle":"2014 10th International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 10th International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963214/6975799/06975918.pdf","startPage":"681","endPage":"686","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2014.6975918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6975799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human activity recognition using smartphone sensors with two-stage continuous hidden Markov models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6975918","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6975918/","displayDocTitle":"Human activity recognition using smartphone sensors with two-stage continuous hidden Markov models","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14808263","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6975918/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human activity recognition using smartphone sensors with two-stage continuous hidden Markov models","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"a120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047248S","chronDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963214","isNumber":"6975799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963214","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6975799","articleId":"6975918","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6975982,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085520936"},{"name":"Dalei Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Dalei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085443917"},{"name":"Hong Zhong","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37572886500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5151-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5150-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"}],"articleNumber":"6975982","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":287},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Access control","Encryption","Servers","Public key"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","cloud computing","cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiauthority based weighted attribute encryption scheme","cryptographic technique","fine-grained access control","cloud computing environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["access control","multi-authority","attribute-based encryption","cloud computing","weighted attribute"]}],"abstract":"Multi-Authority Attribute-Based Encryption is a promising cryptographic technique for realizing fine-grained access control on the encrypted data in cloud computing.

Spectrum-based fault localization consists in computing a ranking metric on execution traces to identify faulty source code. Existing empirical studies on fault localization show that there is no optimal ranking metric for all faults in practice. In this paper, we propose Multric, a learning-based approach to combining multiple ranking metrics for effective fault localization. In Multric, a suspiciousness score of a program entity is a combination of existing ranking metrics. Multric consists two major phases: learning and ranking. Based on training faults, Multric builds a ranking model by learning from pairs of faulty and non-faulty source code elements. When a new fault appears, Multric computes the final ranking with the learned model. Experiments are conducted on 5386 seeded faults in ten open-source Java programs. We empirically compare Multric against four widely-studied metrics and three recently-proposed one. Our experimental results show that Multric localizes faults more effectively than state-of-art metrics, such as Tarantula, Ochiai, and Ample.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSME.2014.41","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution","pdfPath":"/iel7/6969845/6976043/06976085.pdf","startPage":"191","endPage":"200","doi":"10.1109/ICSME.2014.41","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Combine Multiple Ranking Metrics for Fault Localization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 3 2014","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Combine Multiple Ranking Metrics for Fault Localization","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-3 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6976085/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14809333","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6976085/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Combine Multiple Ranking Metrics for Fault Localization","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"6146a191.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099758S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 3 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6969845","isNumber":"6976043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6969845","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"6976043","articleId":"6976085","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6976101,"authors":[{"name":"Daniele Romano","affiliation":["Delft University of Technology, Software Engineering Research Group, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Romano","id":"37323773100"},{"name":"Steven Raemaekers","affiliation":["Software Improvement Group, Amsterdam, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Raemaekers","id":"37076806700"},{"name":"Martin Pinzger","affiliation":["Software Engineering Research Group, University of Klagenfurt, Austria"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Pinzger","id":"37265107400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6146-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6773"}],"articleNumber":"6976101","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":231},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Biological cells","Simulated annealing","Sociology","Statistics","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","genetic algorithms","Java","pattern clustering","random processes","simulated annealing","software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fat interfaces","genetic algorithm","interface segregation principle","ISP","software system","multiobjective clustering problem","public Java API","Maven repository","random annealing","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interface Segregation Principle","APIs","refactoring","search-based software engineering","genetic algorithms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6976101","abstract":"Recent studies have shown that the violation of the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) is critical for maintaining and evolving software systems. Fat interfaces (i.e., interfaces violating the ISP) change more frequently and degrade the quality of the components coupled to them. According to the ISP the interfaces' design should force no client to depend on methods it does not invoke. Fat interfaces should be split into smaller interfaces exposing only the methods invoked by groups of clients. However, applying the ISP is a challenging task when fat interfaces are invoked differently by many clients. In this paper, we formulate the problem of applying the ISP as a multi-objective clustering problem and we propose a genetic algorithm to solve it. We evaluate the capability of the proposed genetic algorithm with 42,318 public Java APIs whose clients' usage has been mined from the Maven repository. The results of this study show that the genetic algorithm outperforms other search based approaches (i.e., random and simulated annealing approaches) in splitting the APIs according to the ISP.","doi":"10.1109/ICSME.2014.57","pdfPath":"/iel7/6969845/6976043/06976101.pdf","startPage":"351","endPage":"360","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSME.2014.57","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976043","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Refactoring Fat Interfaces Using a Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6976101/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 3 2014","displayDocTitle":"Refactoring Fat Interfaces Using a Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14795138","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6976101/","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-3 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Refactoring Fat Interfaces Using a Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"6146a351.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065921S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 3 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6969845","isNumber":"6976043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6969845","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6976043","articleId":"6976101","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6976114,"authors":[{"name":"David Binkley","affiliation":["Loyola University Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Binkley","id":"37275658000"},{"name":"Dawn Lawrie","affiliation":["Loyola University Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Dawn","lastName":"Lawrie","id":"37599910700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6146-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6773"}],"articleNumber":"6976114","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":177},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6976114","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Software","Information retrieval","Stability analysis","Software engineering","Computational modeling","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["document handling","information retrieval","learning (artificial intelligence)","software maintenance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning to rank","LtR","information retrieval","software maintenance","feature location","traceability","MAP score","MRR score","MnDCG score","software specific retrieval models","IR","SE","software engineering","machine learning","document ranking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Information Retrieval","Software Specific Retrieval"]}],"abstract":"Learning to Rank (LtR) encompasses a class of machine learning techniques developed to automatically learn how to better rank the documents returned for an information retrieval (IR) search.

Then the compressive samplings are fused by rule of linear weighting. Finally, the fused image is reconstructed by the iterative thresholding projection (ITP) algorithm with removal of blocking artifacts.

In perfect electric conducting (PEC) ground reflected channel, the different receiver antenna height is studied. It suggests that the channel capacity will increase with the increase of the receiver antenna height.","doi":"10.1109/WARTIA.2014.6976492","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Workshop on Advanced Research and Technology in Industry Applications (WARTIA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Workshop on Advanced Research and Technology in Industry Applications (WARTIA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963756/6976172/06976492.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WARTIA.2014.6976492","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976172","startPage":"1187","endPage":"1190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of different reflective surface and unequal receiving antenna height on channel characteristics of hexapolarized MIMO system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6976492","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effect of different reflective surface and unequal receiving antenna height on channel characteristics of hexapolarized MIMO system","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6976492/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29-30 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14808500","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6976492/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of different reflective surface and unequal receiving antenna height on channel characteristics of hexapolarized MIMO system","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"WARTIA319ZE105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051312S","chronDate":"29-30 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963756","isNumber":"6976172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963756","xplore-issue":"6976172","articleId":"6976492","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6976501,"authors":[{"name":"Lijie Zuo","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Lab of Mobile Communications Technology, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Lijie Zuo","id":"37085447532"},{"name":"Weijia Lei","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Lab of Mobile Communications Technology, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Weijia Lei","id":"37656500200"},{"name":"Xianzhong Xie","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Lab of Mobile Communications Technology, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Xianzhong Xie","id":"37288936900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6989-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6988-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6976501","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Security","Array signal processing","Noise","Physical layer","Wireless communication","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","array signal processing","convex programming","cooperative communication","jamming","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication security","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial channel state information","physical layer security technology","information leakage reduction","wireless communication system","one-way wiretap channel","source-destination pair","multiple cooperating relay nodes","ECSI","eavesdropper channel state information","amplify-and-forward-based relay beamforming","AF","cooperation jamming technology","CJ","relay weight optimization","convex optimization techniques","secure transmission rate enhancement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["physical layer security","relay beamforming","cooperation jamming","artificial noise","secrecy rate"]}],"abstract":"The physical layer security technology is an effective way to reduce information leakage in a wireless communication system. In this paper, we study the physical-layer security of one-way wiretap channel which contains a source-destination pair, an eavesdropper and multiple cooperating relay nodes. What's more, in this channel, there exists direct link between the source and the destination (eavesdropper) and lacks he eavesdropper's channel state information (ECSI). To address its physical-layer security, we proposed a scheme which combines amplify-and-forward (AF)-based relay beamforming and cooperation jamming (CJ) technology. We aim at minimizing the power available for transmitting desired information in relays and optimizing the relay weights under the scenario of limiting the signal to ratio at the destination to a given range, which can be solved by convex optimization techniques. After that, we prove that the optimization results are unique and globally optimum. And the numerical results show that the proposed design can effectively enhance secure transmission rate.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WARTIA.2014.6976501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976172","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Workshop on Advanced Research and Technology in Industry Applications (WARTIA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Workshop on Advanced Research and Technology in Industry Applications (WARTIA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963756/6976172/06976501.pdf","endPage":"1228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The scheme based on partial channel state information for the physical layer security","doi":"10.1109/WARTIA.2014.6976501","startPage":"1225","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6976501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"The scheme based on partial channel state information for the physical layer security","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6976501/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14808380","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6976501/","conferenceDate":"29-30 Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The scheme based on partial channel state information for the physical layer security","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"WARTIA328ZE128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061665S","chronDate":"29-30 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963756","isNumber":"6976172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963756","xplore-issue":"6976172","articleId":"6976501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6976527,"authors":[{"name":"Yurong Zhang","affiliation":["State Grid Chongqing Electric Power Company, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Yurong Zhang","id":"37085527096"},{"name":"Bin Wang","affiliation":["State Grid Chongqing Electric Power Company, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Bin Wang","id":"37085538399"},{"name":"Min Zhang","affiliation":["State Grid Chongqing Electric Power Company, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Min Zhang","id":"37085525275"},{"name":"Yi Feng","affiliation":["State Grid Chongqing Electric Power Company, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Yi Feng","id":"37085545824"},{"name":"Wenzhong Cao","affiliation":["State Grid Chongqing Electric Power Company, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Wenzhong Cao","id":"37085535005"},{"name":"Lin Zhang","affiliation":["State Grid Chongqing Electric Power Company, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Lin Zhang","id":"37085544699"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6989-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6988-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6976527","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":447},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wind power generation","Heuristic algorithms","Load modeling","Power systems","Spinning","Uncertainty","Forecasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","power generation dispatch","power generation scheduling","wind power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unit commitment","wind power uncertainty","load uncertainty","spinning reserve","unit dispatch optimization","multiple scenario model","scenario reduction technique","maximum variation range","particle swarm optimization","PSO-oriented dynamic adjustment","convergence performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wind power system","unit commitment","scenario reduction technique","boundary scenario","particle swarm optimization"]}],"abstract":"With the annual capacity growth of wind power integration, the stochastic wind power makes it increasingly difficult to optimize traditional unit commitment with fixed load and wind power percentage. Considering load and wind powder uncertainty, the multiple scenario model of load and wind power was established using scenario reduction techniques. To explore effect of load and wind power uncertainty, the positive and negative spinning reserve needs of the unit commitment were determined based on the maximum variation ranges of load and wind power under different scenarios. Considering effect of different loads and wind powers under different scenarios on the unit dispatch optimization, taking the weighted sum of mean and variance of generating cost under all scenarios as the objective function, a model for unit dispatch optimization that considers load and wind power uncertainty was established. This model was solved using improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. PSO-oriented dynamic adjustment of unit output range was proposed in order to improve the convergence performance of the PSO algorithm during iteration. The accuracy and validity of the proposed model and algorithm were verified by a case study based on a typical 10-unit commitment.","doi":"10.1109/WARTIA.2014.6976527","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Workshop on Advanced Research and Technology in Industry Applications (WARTIA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Workshop on Advanced Research and Technology in Industry Applications (WARTIA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963756/6976172/06976527.pdf","startPage":"1324","endPage":"1328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WARTIA.2014.6976527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unit commitment considering effect of load and wind power uncertainty","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6976527","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6976527/","displayDocTitle":"Unit commitment considering effect of load and wind power uncertainty","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14808493","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6976527/","conferenceDate":"29-30 Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unit commitment considering effect of load and wind power uncertainty","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"WARTIA354ZE169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047692S","chronDate":"29-30 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963756","isNumber":"6976172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963756","xplore-issue":"6976172","articleId":"6976527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6976626,"authors":[{"name":"Johannes Bl\u00f6mer","affiliation":["University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Bl\u00f6mer","id":"37085535855"},{"name":"Peter G\u00fcnther","affiliation":["Universitat Paderborn, Paderborn, Nordrhein-Westfalen, DE"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"G\u00fcnther","id":"37085369209"},{"name":"Gennadij Liske","affiliation":["University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Gennadij","lastName":"Liske","id":"37085537665"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6292-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6976626","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"abstract":"In the last decade pairings have become an important, and often indispensable, ingredient in the construction of identity-based and attribute-based cryptosystems, as well as group signatures and credential systems.

Tampering with the clock signal or the supply voltage are two popular techniques for generating erroneous behaviour. In this work we perform an in-depth analysis of the vulnerability of two different microcontroller platforms on clock and supply voltage tampering. The influence on three different groups of instructions is discussed in detail: arithmetical/logical instructions, branch instructions and memory instructions. A novel approach, combining short-time under powering with clock glitches, is applied in order to increase the reproducibility of the fault and the probability for the fault to occur. Results show that the fetch stage and the execution stage of the instruction pipeline are mainly affected by clock glitches, leading to skipped or duplicated execution or faulty calculation results. One sample per platform is used for the experiments, but for each fault type an interval for the parameters leading to the fault with a probability of 100% is given. The values in the middle of this interval are less sensitive to sample distribution as well as environmental influences. This knowledge allows to efficiently attack software implementations of cryptographic primitives implemented on one of the evaluated platforms.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FDTC.2014.11","publicationTitle":"2014 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975317/6976615/06976627.pdf","startPage":"8","endPage":"17","doi":"10.1109/FDTC.2014.11","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Effects of Clock and Power Supply Tampering on Two Microcontroller Platforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-23 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"On the Effects of Clock and Power Supply Tampering on Two Microcontroller Platforms","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-23 Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6976627/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14809439","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6976627/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Effects of Clock and Power Supply Tampering on Two Microcontroller Platforms","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"6292a008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063682S","chronDate":"23-23 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6975317","isNumber":"6976615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6975317","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6976615","articleId":"6976627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6976628,"authors":[{"name":"Raghavan Kumar","affiliation":["University of Massachusetts Amherst, USA"],"firstName":"Raghavan","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37709982800"},{"name":"Philipp Jovanovic","affiliation":["University of Passau, Germany"],"firstName":"Philipp","lastName":"Jovanovic","id":"37085464277"},{"name":"Wayne Burleson","affiliation":["University of Massachusetts Amherst, USA"],"firstName":"Wayne","lastName":"Burleson","id":"37273906500"},{"name":"Ilia Polian","affiliation":["University of Passau, Germany"],"firstName":"Ilia","lastName":"Polian","id":"37273423400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6292-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6976628","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":551},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trojan horses","Circuit faults","Logic gates","Inverters","Transistors","Testing","Cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","cryptography","invasive software","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parametric Trojans","fault-injection attacks","cryptographic hardware","probability","ASIC implementation","lightweight cipher PRINCE","full circuit-level simulation","differential cryptanalysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fault-based cryptanalysis","fault injection","hardware Trojans"]}],"abstract":"We propose two extremely stealthy hardware Trojans that facilitate fault-injection attacks in cryptographic blocks.

A special feature of GOST is that its eight S-boxes can be secret. However, most of the researches on GOST assume that the design of these S-boxes is known. In this paper, the security of GOST against side-channel attacks is examined with algebraic fault analysis (AFA), which combines the algebraic cryptanalysis with the fault attack. Three AFAs on GOST, which have different attack goals in different scenarios, are investigated. The results show that 8 fault injections are required to recover the secret key when the full design of GOST is known, which is less than 64 fault injections required in previous work. 64 fault injections are required to recover the eight unknown S-boxes assuming the key is known. 270 fault injections are required to recover the key and the eight S-boxes when both are unknown. The results prove that AFA is very effective and keeping some components in a cipher secret cannot guarantee its security against fault attacks.","doi":"10.1109/FDTC.2014.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976615","startPage":"29","endPage":"39","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975317/6976615/06976629.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FDTC.2014.13","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algebraic Fault Analysis on GOST for Key Recovery and Reverse Engineering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equations","Mathematical model","Ciphers","Encryption","Standards","Reverse engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","private key cryptography","standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebraic fault analysis","GOST","key recovery","reverse engineering","block cipher","encryption standard","Russian Federation","S-boxes","side-channel attacks","AFA","fault injections","secret key","cipher secret","fault attacks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["algebraic cryptanalysis","differential fault analysis","GOST","key recovery","reverse engineering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-23 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Algebraic Fault Analysis on GOST for Key Recovery and Reverse Engineering","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6976629/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6976629/","accessionNumber":"14795360","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","conferenceDate":"23-23 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algebraic Fault Analysis on GOST for Key Recovery and Reverse Engineering","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"6292a029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.130367S","chronDate":"23-23 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6975317","isNumber":"6976615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6975317","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6976615","articleId":"6976629","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6976636,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Korak","affiliation":["Institute for Applied Information Processing and Communications (IAIK), Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Korak","id":"37085397002"},{"name":"Michael Hutter","affiliation":["Institute for Applied Information Processing and Communications (IAIK), Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Hutter","id":"37410827900"},{"name":"Baris Ege","affiliation":["Institute for Applied Information Processing and Communications (IAIK), Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Baris","lastName":"Ege","id":"37085335325"},{"name":"Lejla Batina","affiliation":["Institute for Applied Information Processing and Communications (IAIK), Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Lejla","lastName":"Batina","id":"37272479700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6292-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6976636","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":481},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6976636","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Microcontrollers","Heating","Registers","Circuit faults","Performance evaluation","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocks","cryptography","microcontrollers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clock glitch attacks","fault attacks","fault injection techniques","EM pulses","optical inductions","AVR microcontroller","thermo attacks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault attacks","temperature","heating","non-invasive","glitches","AVR","ATmega"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FDTC.2014.20","endPage":"114","startPage":"104","publicationTitle":"2014 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975317/6976615/06976636.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FDTC.2014.20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clock Glitch Attacks in the Presence of Heating","abstract":"Fault attacks have been widely studied in the past but most of the literature describes only individual fault-injection techniques such as power/clock glitches, EM pulses, optical inductions, or heating/cooling. In this work, we investigate combined fault attacks by performing clock-glitch attacks under the impact of heating. We performed practical experiments on an 8-bit AVR microcontroller which resulted in the following findings. First, we identified that the success rate of glitch attacks performed at an ambient temperature of 100\u00b0C is higher than under room temperature. We were able to induce more faults and significantly increase the time frame when the device is susceptible to glitches which makes fault attacks easier to perform in practice. Second, and independently of the ambient temperature, we demonstrate that glitches cause individual instructions to repeat, we are able to add new random instructions, and we identified that opcode gets modified such that address registers of individual instructions get changed. Beside these new results, this is the first work that reports results of combined glitch and thermo attacks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-23 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6976636/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6976636/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14795357","conferenceDate":"23-23 Sept. 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Clock Glitch Attacks in the Presence of Heating","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clock Glitch Attacks in the Presence of Heating","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"6292a104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075456S","chronDate":"23-23 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6975317","isNumber":"6976615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6975317","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6976615","articleId":"6976636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6976666,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Edache Ajeh","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Environment, Northumbria University, Newcastle United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Daniel Edache","lastName":"Ajeh","id":"37085540530"},{"name":"Jeremy Ellman","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Environment, Northumbria University, Newcastle United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Ellman","id":"37621295800"},{"name":"Shelagh Keogh","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Environment, Northumbria University, Newcastle United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Shelagh","lastName":"Keogh","id":"37085542037"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4264-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6976666","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":661},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Computational modeling","Organizations","Computers","Analytical models","Maintenance engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cost-benefit analysis","software cost estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cost modelling system","cloud computing modelling system","cloud services","IT infrastructure","usage patterns","cost benefit","cost savings","utilization capacity","infrastructure acquisition cost"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Web application","cloud computing","cloud costing","cost model","cloud analyst","cloud simulator","utilization model","cloud modelling"]}],"abstract":"An advance in technology unlocks new opportunities for organizations to increase their productivity, efficiency and process automation while reducing the cost of doing business as well. The emergence of cloud computing addresses these prospects through the provision of agile systems that are scalable, flexible and reliable as well as cost effective. Cloud computing has made hosting and deployment of computing resources cheaper and easier with no up-front charges but pay per-use flexible payment methods. However, there is lack of tools to aid decision makers in evaluating the much promised benefits of cloud computing particularly its cost benefit. To fill this gap in tools for evaluating the cost benefit of cloud services as an alternative to on-premise computing, a cost modelling system for cloud computing (CCMS) is proposed. A prototype model was developed to simulate the cost incurred on maintaining an on-premise IT infrastructure under various usage patterns with the purpose of determining the cost benefit of cloud alternatives. CCMS assists decision makers with insights on cost savings of adopting cloud alternatives, plan computing budgets and also demonstrate how the utilization capacity and cost of acquisition of an infrastructure can influence the cost savings from cloud alternatives.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cost Modelling System for Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/ICCSA.2014.24","startPage":"74","endPage":"84","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSA.2014.24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976641","publicationTitle":"2014 14th International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 14th International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6969843/6976641/06976666.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6976666","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6976666/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2014-July 3 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Cost Modelling System for Cloud Computing","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6976666/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14795068","conferenceDate":"30 June-3 July 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cost Modelling System for Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Guimaraes, Portugal","sourcePdf":"4264a074.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07314S","chronDate":"June 30 2014-July 3 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6969843","isNumber":"6976641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6969843","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6976641","articleId":"6976666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6976726,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan Krause","affiliation":["Stanford University"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Krause","id":"38467123300"},{"name":"Timnit Gebru","affiliation":["Stanford University"],"firstName":"Timnit","lastName":"Gebru","id":"37085531197"},{"name":"Jia Deng","affiliation":["University of Michigan"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Deng","id":"37085544091"},{"name":"Li-Jia Li","affiliation":["Yahoo!

We focus on two major challenges: learning expressive appearance descriptors and localizing discriminative parts. To this end, we propose an object representation that detects important parts and describes fine grained appearances. The part detectors are learned in a fully unsupervised manner, based on the insight that images with similar poses can be automatically discovered for fine-grained classes in the same domain. The appearance descriptors are learned using a convolutional neural network. Our approach requires only image level class labels, without any use of part annotations or segmentation masks, which may be costly to obtain.

The network has a symmetry structure with two sub-networks which are connected by a cosine layer. Each sub network includes two convolutional layers and a full connected layer.

In this paper, we propose a new robust linear programming method to fuse multibiometrics by combining the modalities optimally. The proposed method can provide a reasonable trade off between conservatism and robustness. Experimental results on CASIA-Iris-Distance, a public and challenging multibiometric database, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of this method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966883/6976709/06976770.pdf","startPage":"291","endPage":"296","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2014.59","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2014.59","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976709","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6976770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fusion of Multibiometrics Based on a New Robust Linear Programming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Iris recognition","Linear programming","Noise","Feature extraction","Face","Authentication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","image fusion","image recognition","linear programming","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multibiometrics fusion","robust linear programming method","CASIA-Iris-Distance","multibiometric database","information security"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6976770/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Fusion of Multibiometrics Based on a New Robust Linear Programming","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6976770/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14808743","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fusion of Multibiometrics Based on a New Robust Linear Programming","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"5209a291.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053593S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966883","isNumber":"6976709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966883","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6976709","articleId":"6976770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6976772,"authors":[{"name":"Vijay Kumar","affiliation":["International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37076593200"},{"name":"Anoop M.

This has applications in video indexing, content based search, surveillance, and real time recognition on wearable computers. We propose a two stage approach for this problem. First, we recognize the faces in a video using a sparse representation framework using l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-minimization and select a few key-frames based on a robust confidence measure. We then use transductive learning to propagate the labels from the key-frames to the remaining frames by incorporating constraints simultaneously in temporal and feature spaces. This is in contrast to some of the previous approaches where every test frame/track is identified independently, ignoring the correlation between the faces in video tracks. Having a few key frames belonging to few subjects for label propagation rather than a large dictionary of actors reduces the amount of confusion. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on Movie Trailer face dataset and five movie clips, and achieve a significant improvement in labeling accuracy compared to previous approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2014.61","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966883/6976709/06976772.pdf","startPage":"303","endPage":"308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2014.61","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face Recognition in Videos by Label Propagation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6976772","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6976772/","displayDocTitle":"Face Recognition in Videos by Label Propagation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14809189","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6976772/","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face Recognition in Videos by Label Propagation","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"5209a303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072157S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966883","isNumber":"6976709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966883","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6976709","articleId":"6976772","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6976782,"authors":[{"name":"Pierre-Francois Marteau","affiliation":["IRISA (UMR 6074), Universit\u00e9 de Bretagne Sud, Vannes, France"],"firstName":"Pierre-Francois","lastName":"Marteau","id":"37604705600"},{"name":"Sylvie Gibet","affiliation":["IRISA (UMR 6074), Universit\u00e9 de Bretagne Sud, Vannes, France"],"firstName":"Sylvie","lastName":"Gibet","id":"37569545200"},{"name":"Cl\u00e9ment Reverdy","affiliation":["IRISA (UMR 6074), Universit\u00e9 de Bretagne Sud, Vannes, France"],"firstName":"Cl\u00e9ment","lastName":"Reverdy","id":"37085552060"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5209-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"6976782","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Accuracy","Hidden Markov models","Joints","Support vector machines","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","gesture recognition","image sampling","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elastic kernel machines","gestural action recognition","dimensionality reduction","spatial axis","gestural sequences variability","computational complexity","quadratic complexity","elastic kernel machine learning","temporal down-sampling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6976782","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2014.71","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2014.71","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976709","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966883/6976709/06976782.pdf","startPage":"363","endPage":"368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Down-sampling Coupled to Elastic Kernel Machines for Efficient Recognition of Isolated Gestures","abstract":"In the field of gestural action recognition, many studies have focused on dimensionality reduction along the spatial axis, to reduce both the variability of gestural sequences expressed in the reduced space, and the computational complexity of their processing. It is noticeable that very few of these methods have explicitly addressed the dimensionality reduction along the time axis. This is however a major issue with regard to the use of elastic distances characterized by a quadratic complexity. To partially fill this apparent gap, we present in this paper an approach based on temporal down-sampling associated to elastic kernel machine learning. We experimentally show, on two data sets that are widely referenced in the domain of human gesture recognition, and very different in terms of quality of motion capture, that it is possible to significantly reduce the number of skeleton frames while maintaining a good recognition rate. The method proves to give satisfactory results at a level currently reached by state-of-the-art methods on these data sets. The computational complexity reduction makes this approach eligible for real-time applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6976782/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6976782/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14808920","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Down-sampling Coupled to Elastic Kernel Machines for Efficient Recognition of Isolated Gestures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Down-sampling Coupled to Elastic Kernel Machines for Efficient Recognition of Isolated Gestures","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"5209a363.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079003S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966883","isNumber":"6976709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966883","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6976709","articleId":"6976782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6976807,"authors":[{"name":"Jiangning Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Bath, Bath, UK"],"firstName":"Jiangning","lastName":"Gao","id":"37085548539"},{"name":"Mehryar Emambakhsh","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Bath, Bath, UK"],"firstName":"Mehryar","lastName":"Emambakhsh","id":"37540737600"},{"name":"Adrian N.

In this paper, an expression robust reject or is proposed that first robustly locates landmarks on the relatively stable structure of the nose and its environs, termed the cheek/nose region. Then, by defining curves connecting the landmarks, a small set of features (4 curves with only 15 points each) on the cheek/nose surface are selected using the Bosphorus database. The resulting reject or, which can quickly eliminate a large number of candidates at an early stage, is further evaluated on the FRGC database for both the identification and verification scenarios.

When conditions are less ideal or users are uncooperative or unaware of their biometrics being taken the image acquisition quality suffers. This makes it harder for iris localization and segmentation algorithms to properly segment the acquired image into iris and non-iris parts. Segmentation is a critical part in iris recognition systems, since errors in this initial stage are propagated to subsequent processing stages. Therefore, the performance of iris segmentation algorithms is paramount to the performance of the overall system. In order to properly evaluate and develop iris segmentation algorithm, especially under difficult conditions like off angle and significant occlusions or bad lighting, it is beneficial to directly assess the segmentation algorithm. Currently, when evaluating the performance of iris segmentation algorithms this is mostly done by utilizing the recognition rate, and consequently the overall performance of the biometric system. In order to streamline the development and assessment of iris segmentation algorithms with the dependence on the whole biometric system we have generated a iris segmentation ground truth database. We will show a method for evaluating iris segmentation performance base on this ground truth database and give examples of how to identify problematic cases in order to further analyse the segmentation algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2014.101","startPage":"527","endPage":"532","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966883/6976709/06976811.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2014.101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Ground Truth for Iris Segmentation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iris recognition","Image segmentation","Iris","Algorithm design and analysis","Image databases","Biomedical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","iris recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iris biometric systems","environmental conditions","image acquisition","iris localization algorithms","iris segmentation algorithms","iris recognition systems","occlusions","iris segmentation ground truth database","iris segmentation performance evaluation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6976811/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Ground Truth for Iris Segmentation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6976811/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14808610","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Ground Truth for Iris Segmentation","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"5209a527.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067677S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966883","isNumber":"6976709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966883","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6976709","articleId":"6976811","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6976834,"authors":[{"name":"Eshed Ohn-Bar","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"Eshed","lastName":"Ohn-Bar","id":"37073869900"},{"name":"Sujitha Martin","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"Sujitha","lastName":"Martin","id":"38494473300"},{"name":"Ashish Tawari","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"Ashish","lastName":"Tawari","id":"37547299000"},{"name":"Mohan M.

The third layer is the resultant combination of the two layers. Thus we integrate both the texture level as well as the pixel level information to generate the final result.

Inherent difficulties concern the similar density of adjacent structures, and that physically-separated structures appear to touch in scanned imagery. In this study, we describe a new technique based on pressure analogy that depends on the local features of the image to accurately and automatically segment and visualize the femur bone and separate it from the acetabulum. The Dice coefficient was employed to study the similarity between the surface area of the segmentations compared with the manually segmented data, and a high value has been achieved. The same method also showed promising results in segmenting other limbs such as the pelvis, tibia and fibula bones.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2014.177","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966883/6976709/06976887.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2014.177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976709","startPage":"972","endPage":"977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Femur Bone Segmentation Using a Pressure Analogy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6976887","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Femur Bone Segmentation Using a Pressure Analogy","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6976887/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14809172","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6976887/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Femur Bone Segmentation Using a Pressure Analogy","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"5209a972.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05636S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966883","isNumber":"6976709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966883","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6976709","articleId":"6976887","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6976889,"authors":[{"name":"Sharmin Nilufar","affiliation":["Ottawa Hospital Research Institute Ottawa, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Sharmin","lastName":"Nilufar","id":"37395317300"},{"name":"Theodore J.

Although there are many general approaches to contour detection, achieving good performance in any given application often requires considerable hand-tuning of algorithm parameters, optimization criteria, or pre-processing of the images themselves. We propose a novel framework for contour detection that combines learning of a probabilistic classifier with dynamic programming-based contour optimization. On test images, we find that our system is able to learn to detect specific types of contours in images, often from just a single example contour. After learning, the system can be used to speed up interactive contour detection, requiring the user only to click once on each target object, or it can be used to automatically detect all contours of the same type in an image or set of images.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Shape","Dynamic programming","Image color analysis","Optimization","Probabilistic logic","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","dynamic programming","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","dynamic programming snakes","natural scenes","biomedical images","hand-tuning","optimization criteria","probabilistic classifier learning","interactive contour detection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2014.179","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966883/6976709/06976889.pdf","startPage":"984","endPage":"989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976709","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2014.179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Detect Contours with Dynamic Programming Snakes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6976889","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Detect Contours with Dynamic Programming Snakes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6976889/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6976889/","accessionNumber":"14809186","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Detect Contours with Dynamic Programming Snakes","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"5209a984.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084257S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966883","isNumber":"6976709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966883","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6976709","articleId":"6976889","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6976906,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Hou","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Xi'an Univ. of Science and Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Hou","id":"37594474200"},{"name":"Yanning Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical Univ., Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yanning","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292467300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5209-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"6976906","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":235},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Transforms","Compressed sensing","PSNR","Quantization (signal)","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","image coding","image denoising","image reconstruction","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["effective image block compressed sensing algorithm","projected Land Weber","bivariate shrinkage","natural images","improved noise variance estimation method","soft-thresholding bivariate shrinkage model","wavelet-based image denoising","noise removal","image reconstruction quality","BCS PL-BS algorithm","DPCM quantization","reconstruction performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressed sensing","projected Landweber","bivariate shrinkage","wavelet transform"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose an effective block compressed sensing algorithm using projected Land Weber based on bivariate shrinkage (BCS PL-BS) for natural images, and an improved noise variance estimation method is presented by using soft-thresholding bivariate shrinkage model for wavelet-based image denoising, which can more effectively remove noise and achieve better image reconstruction quality.

This paper investigates the usage of deep learning techniques, in particular Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), for texture classification in two forest species datasets - one with macroscopic images and another with microscopic images. Given the higher resolution images of these problems, we present a method that is able to cope with the high-resolution texture images so as to achieve high accuracy and avoid the burden of training and defining an architecture with a large number of free parameters.

The findings presented in the work clearly suggest that the analysis of the general image quality of real face samples reveals highly valuable information that may be very efficiently used to discriminate them from fake images.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6976921/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14808965","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6976921/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Face Anti-spoofing Based on General Image Quality Assessment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face Anti-spoofing Based on General Image Quality Assessment","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"5209b173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052156S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966883","isNumber":"6976709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966883","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"6976709","articleId":"6976921","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6976937,"authors":[{"name":"Jinying Chen","affiliation":["Department of Speech, Language and Multimedia Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Jinying","lastName":"Chen","id":"37716530300"},{"name":"Yue Wu","affiliation":["Department of Speech, Language and Multimedia Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Wu","id":"37600827400"},{"name":"Huaigu Cao","affiliation":["Department of Speech, Language and Multimedia Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Huaigu","lastName":"Cao","id":"37400394900"},{"name":"Prem Natarajan","affiliation":["Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern California, Marina del Rey, California, USA"],"firstName":"Prem","lastName":"Natarajan","id":"37269307100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5209-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"6976937","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6976937","abstract":"This paper presents a new framework for OCR error detection, which uses a conditional random field model to combine rich features from multiple sources, including confusion networks (c-nets), lexical local context and recurrent neural network language model (RNNLM). We propose a novel, efficient method for computing character-level c-net based RNNLM scores by using dynamic programming and c-net partial unfolding. Our experiments show that our error detection model has consistent observable improvements over a high baseline employed by our current OCR demo system, as measured by average precision and detection error trade-off curve on two test sets of Chinese image documents. Both linguistic and recognition features contribute to the high performance, with the former especially informative. In addition, we show that the new feature we proposed, the c-net RNNLM feature, plays a remarkable beneficial role in improving error detection rate. These results suggest that applications on top of image text recognition can benefit substantially from a hybrid strategy that combines techniques from optical character recognition and natural language processing.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2014.227","startPage":"1266","endPage":"1271","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966883/6976709/06976937.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2014.227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Confusion Network Based Recurrent Neural Network Language Modeling for Chinese OCR Error Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical character recognition software","Feature extraction","Hidden Markov models","Lattices","Speech recognition","Pragmatics","Character recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["document image processing","dynamic programming","natural language processing","optical character recognition","recurrent neural nets","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["confusion network","recurrent neural network language modeling","Chinese OCR error detection","conditional random field model","lexical local context","RNNLM","dynamic programming","c-net partial unfolding","Chinese image documents","image text recognition","optical character recognition","natural language processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["error detection","recurrent neural network language model","optical character recognition","confusion networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6976937/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Confusion Network Based Recurrent Neural Network Language Modeling for Chinese OCR Error Detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6976937/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14809130","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Confusion Network Based Recurrent Neural Network Language Modeling for Chinese OCR Error Detection","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"5209b266.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10483S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966883","isNumber":"6976709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966883","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6976709","articleId":"6976937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6976948,"authors":[{"name":"Kha Gia Quach","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Concordia University Montreal, Quebec, Canada"],"firstName":"Kha Gia","lastName":"Quach","id":"38556625700"},{"name":"Chi Nhan Duong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Concordia University Montreal, Quebec, Canada"],"firstName":"Chi Nhan","lastName":"Duong","id":"38553221900"},{"name":"Tien D.

The binary RBM is usually used to construct the DNN. However, a continuous probability of each node is used as real value state, although the state of the binary RBM's node should be represented by a random binary variable. One of main reasons of this abuse is that it works. One of others is to reduce a computational cost. In this paper, we propose a novel inference of the RBM, considering that the input of the RBM is the random binary variable. Straight forward derivation of the proposed inference is intractable. Then, we also propose the closed-form approximation of it. We convince that the proposed inference is more reasonable than a conventional algorithm of the RBM.

To predict the label of a pixel in an image, the model takes a hierarchical context as the input, which is obtained by combining multiple context patches on different scales. Short range contexts depict the local details, while long range contexts capture the object-scene relationships in an image. Early means that we combine the context patches of a pixel into a hierarchical one before any trainable layers are learned, i.e., early-combing. In contrast, late-combing means that the combination occurs later, e.g., when the convolutional feature extractor in a network has already been learned. We find that it is vital for the whole model to jointly learn the patterns of contexts on different scales in our task. Experiments show that early-combing performs better than late-combing. On the dataset1 built up by Baidu IDL2 for a latest person segmentation contest, our method beats all the competitors with a considerable margin. Qualitative results also show that the proposed method is almost ready for practical application.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Early Hierarchical Contexts Learned by Convolutional Networks for Image Segmentation","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2014.273","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966883/6976709/06976983.pdf","startPage":"1538","endPage":"1543","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2014.273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976709","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6976983","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6976983/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Early Hierarchical Contexts Learned by Convolutional Networks for Image Segmentation","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6976983/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14809215","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Early Hierarchical Contexts Learned by Convolutional Networks for Image Segmentation","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"5209b538.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061709S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966883","isNumber":"6976709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966883","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6976709","articleId":"6976983","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6977012,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Moeini","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Moeini","id":"37283428300"},{"name":"Hossein Moeini","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Semnan University, Semnan, Iran"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Moeini","id":"37085338329"},{"name":"Fazael Ayatollahi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Fazael","lastName":"Ayatollahi","id":"37085456443"},{"name":"Karim Faez","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Karim","lastName":"Faez","id":"37270276800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5209-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"6977012","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":250},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Face","Solid modeling","Image reconstruction","Face recognition","Three-dimensional displays","Hidden Markov models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","image classification","image reconstruction","image texture","support vector machines","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["makeup-invariant face recognition method","3D face","dual-tree complex wavelet transform","women 2D real-world images","feature extraction method","face depth features","face texture features","3D face reconstruction","single 2D frontal image","facial expressions","DT-CWT","2D feature vectors","reconstructed depth images","3D feature vectors","support vector machine","SVM","image database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face recognition","3D shape recovery"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a novel feature extraction method is proposed to handle facial makeup in face recognition. To develop a face recognition method robust to facial makeup, features are extracted from face depth in which facial makeup is not effective. Then, face depth features are added to face texture features to perform feature extraction. Accordingly, a 3D face is reconstructed from only a single 2D frontal image with/without facial expressions. Then, the texture and depth of the face are extracted from the reconstructed model. Afterwards, the Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DT-CWT) is applied to both texture and reconstructed depth of the face to extract the feature vectors from both texture and reconstructed depth images. Finally, by combining 2D and 3D feature vectors, the final feature vectors are generated and classified by the Support Vector Machine (SVM). Promising results were achieved for makeup-invariant face recognition on the available image database based on the present method compared to several state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2014.301","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966883/6976709/06977012.pdf","startPage":"1710","endPage":"1715","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2014.301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Makeup-Invariant Face Recognition by 3D Face: Modeling and Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform from Women's 2D Real-World Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977012","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977012/","displayDocTitle":"Makeup-Invariant Face Recognition by 3D Face: Modeling and Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform from Women's 2D Real-World Images","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14808809","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6977012/","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Makeup-Invariant Face Recognition by 3D Face: Modeling and Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform from Women's 2D Real-World Images","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"5209b710.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073194S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966883","isNumber":"6976709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966883","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6976709","articleId":"6977012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6977013,"authors":[{"name":"Olegs Nikisins","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Computer Science, Riga, Latvia"],"firstName":"Olegs","lastName":"Nikisins","id":"38243416600"},{"name":"Kamal Nasrollahi","affiliation":["Visual Analysis of People Laboratory, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Kamal","lastName":"Nasrollahi","id":"37570156600"},{"name":"Modris Greitans","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Computer Science, Riga, Latvia"],"firstName":"Modris","lastName":"Greitans","id":"37568146100"},{"name":"Thomas B.

The current literature on facial image analysis, from face detection to face and facial expression recognition, are mainly performed in either RGB, Depth (D), or both of these modalities.

This paper paves the way for performing such facial analyzes using synchronized RGB-D-T facial images by introducing a database of 51 persons including facial images of different rotations, illuminations, and expressions. Furthermore, a face recognition algorithm has been developed to use these images. The experimental results show that face recognition using such three modalities provides better results compared to face recognition in any of such modalities in most of the cases.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2014.302","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966883/6976709/06977013.pdf","startPage":"1716","endPage":"1721","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2014.302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RGB-D-T Based Face Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977013","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977013/","displayDocTitle":"RGB-D-T Based Face Recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14808619","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6977013/","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RGB-D-T Based Face Recognition","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"5209b716.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072667S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966883","isNumber":"6976709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966883","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6976709","articleId":"6977013","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6977014,"authors":[{"name":"Antti Moilanen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Engineering University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Antti","lastName":"Moilanen","id":"37085508549"},{"name":"Guoying Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Engineering University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Guoying","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085517866"},{"name":"Matti Pietik\u00e4inen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Engineering University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Matti","lastName":"Pietik\u00e4inen","id":"37085348132"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5209-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"6977014","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":625},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Videos","Face","Databases","Vectors","Hafnium","Histograms","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["emotion recognition","face recognition","image sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rapid facial movements","appearance-based feature difference analysis","microexpressions spotting","continuous emotion recognition","video sequence","face-related events","eye blinks","appearance-based features","CASME database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Affective computing","gesture and behavior analysis","facial expression recognition"]}],"abstract":"Spotting micro-expressions is a primary step for continuous emotion recognition from videos. Spotting in this context refers to automatically finding the temporal locations of the face-related events from a video sequence. Rapid facial movements mainly include micro-expressions and eye blinks. However, the role of eye blinks in expressing emotions is still controversial, and often they are considered as micro-expressions as well. In this paper a simple method for automatically spotting rapid facial movements from videos is proposed. The method relies on analyzing differences in appearance-based features of sequential frames. In addition to finding the temporal locations, the system is able to provide spatial information about the movements in the face. Micro-expression spotting experiments are carried out on three datasets consisting only of spontaneous micro-expressions. Baseline micro-expression spotting results are provided for these three datasets including the publicly available CASME database. Also an example of spatial localization of the spotted rapid movements is presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spotting Rapid Facial Movements from Videos Using Appearance-Based Feature Difference Analysis","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2014.303","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966883/6976709/06977014.pdf","startPage":"1722","endPage":"1727","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2014.303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976709","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977014","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977014/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Spotting Rapid Facial Movements from Videos Using Appearance-Based Feature Difference Analysis","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6977014/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14809117","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spotting Rapid Facial Movements from Videos Using Appearance-Based Feature Difference Analysis","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"5209b722.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081469S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966883","isNumber":"6976709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966883","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6976709","articleId":"6977014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6977025,"authors":[{"name":"Tejas Indulal Dhamecha","affiliation":["IIIT, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Tejas Indulal","lastName":"Dhamecha","id":"38233088300"},{"name":"Praneet Sharma","affiliation":["IIIT, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Praneet","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37085462025"},{"name":"Richa Singh","affiliation":["IIIT, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Richa","lastName":"Singh","id":"37329725500"},{"name":"Mayank Vatsa","affiliation":["IIIT, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Mayank","lastName":"Vatsa","id":"37418882300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5209-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"6977025","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":293},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Principal component analysis","Histograms","Feature extraction","Measurement","Vectors","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","gradient methods","image matching","image texture","infrared imaging","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["histogram","oriented gradient features","near infrared face matching","near infrared imagery","face recognition","cross spectral matching","textural feature extraction","NIR-VIS-2.0 cross spectral face database","HOG variants","dimensionality reduction approach","linear discriminant analysis","DSIFT","subspace LDA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HOG Descriptor","Cross Spectral Face Recognition"]}],"abstract":"The advent of near infrared imagery and it's applications in face recognition has instigated research in cross spectral (visible to near infrared) matching.

On NIR-VIS-2.0 cross spectral face database, three HOG variants are analyzed along with dimensionality reduction approaches and linear discriminant analysis.

The signals are recorded in a hand motion control task, when the subject uses a joystick to move a cursor appearing on the screen to hit a virtual target. We detect signal onset using two heuristic schemes based on the experiment process. We apply CHMM to capture the spatial and temporal dynamics between two different channels within fixed length of duration, where each channel is modelled by HMM. The interdependence between two channels are modelled by transitions between hidden states of different individual HMM. There are eight possible directions that the target may appear. We learn eight sets of parameters using EM algorithm to characterize the signal patterns for each possible direction of movement. Given the test signals, the set of learned parameters which produces highest probability likelihood decides the class label. The effectiveness of the model is measured by classification accuracy. The results indicate that CHMM outperforms conventional HMM in most of the cases and is significantly better than first order autoregressive model.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966883/6976709/06977037.pdf","startPage":"1858","endPage":"1862","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2014.325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2014.325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976709","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977037","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coupled Hidden Markov Model for Electrocorticographic Signal Classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Brain modeling","Training","Electroencephalography","Testing","Computational modeling","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","expectation-maximisation algorithm","hidden Markov models","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical signal detection","medical signal processing","probability","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["first order autoregressive model","probability likelihood","test signals","signal patterns","EM algorithm","heuristic schemes","signal onset detection","hand motion control task","CHMM","spatial dynamics","temporal dynamics","ECoG time series signals","multichannel electrocorticographic signal classification","coupled hidden Markov model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977037/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Coupled Hidden Markov Model for Electrocorticographic Signal Classification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6977037/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14808888","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coupled Hidden Markov Model for Electrocorticographic Signal Classification","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"5209b858.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057336S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966883","isNumber":"6976709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966883","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6976709","articleId":"6977037","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6977051,"authors":[{"name":"Remi Trichet","affiliation":["Inst.

Temporal motion of body joints carries crucial information about human actions. However, current dynamic models typically assume stationary local transition and therefore are limited to local dynamics. In contrast, we propose a novel human action recognition algorithm that is able to capture both global and local dynamics of joint trajectories by combining a Gaussian-Binary restricted Boltzmann machine (GB-RBM) with a hidden Markov model (HMM). We present a method to use RBM as a generative model for multi-class classification. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the capability of the proposed method in exploiting the dynamic information at different levels.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976709","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2014.340","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966883/6976709/06977052.pdf","startPage":"1946","endPage":"1951","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2014.340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capturing Global and Local Dynamics for Human Action Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Capturing Global and Local Dynamics for Human Action Recognition","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6977052/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14808829","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977052/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capturing Global and Local Dynamics for Human Action Recognition","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"5209b946.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077122S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966883","isNumber":"6976709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966883","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6976709","articleId":"6977052","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6977093,"authors":[{"name":"Tuan Nguyen","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory, University of Nottingham, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Tuan","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37085559454"},{"name":"Tony P.

Knowledge of the target's likely motion can both significantly reduce the search space and support more effective search strategies. We propose a new approach to target location which utilises sparse estimates of motion direction derived from local features to guide the generation of particles by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based particle filter. The standard two-dimensional random walk is replaced by a series of one-dimensional searches in directions determined by the distribution of local feature motions. Two algorithms based on this approach are presented and evaluated. Experiments on both artificial and publically available, real image sequences show that the highest accuracy is obtained by sampling motion direction. The resulting algorithm successfully handles motion variations and reduces the likelihood that the tracker will be trapped in local extrem a when the target moves close to or is partially occluded by similar objects.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Feature extraction","Image color analysis","Histograms","Adaptation models","Dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image motion analysis","image sampling","image sequences","Markov processes","Monte Carlo methods","particle filtering (numerical methods)","search problems","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual tracking","target appearance modelling","multiple linear searches","motion direction sampling","target location","Markov chain Monte Carlo method","MCMC based particle filter","one-dimensional searches","local feature motions","real image sequences","local extrema"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2014.381","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966883/6976709/06977093.pdf","startPage":"2191","endPage":"2196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976709","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2014.381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking Using Multiple Linear Searches and Motion Direction Sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977093","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tracking Using Multiple Linear Searches and Motion Direction Sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977093/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6977093/","accessionNumber":"14809134","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking Using Multiple Linear Searches and Motion Direction Sampling","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"5209c191.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098976S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966883","isNumber":"6976709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966883","xplore-issue":"6976709","articleId":"6977093","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6977095,"authors":[{"name":"Tong Lu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Lu","id":"37403551600"},{"name":"Liang Wu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085362747"},{"name":"Xiaolin Ma","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaolin","lastName":"Ma","id":"38548588100"},{"name":"Palaiahnakote Shivakumara","affiliation":["Faculty ot Computer Science and Information Technology, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Palaiahnakote","lastName":"Shivakumara","id":"37297275000"},{"name":"Chew Lim Tan","affiliation":["School of Computing, National University of Singapore"],"firstName":"Chew Lim","lastName":"Tan","id":"37277715000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5209-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"6977095","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":248},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manganese","Context modeling","Vectors","Training","Tracking","Prototypes","Context"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","image motion analysis","Markov processes","mixture models","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatio-temporal context modeling","crowded scenes","statistical framework","intrinsic structure","anomaly detection process","crowded context modeling","atomic motion pattern representation","Gaussian mixture model","GMM","Markov random field model","MRF model","adjacent local motion patterns"]}],"abstract":"A novel statistical framework for modeling the intrinsic structure of crowded scenes and detecting abnormal activities is presented in this paper. The proposed framework essentially turns the anomaly detection process into two parts, namely, motion pattern representation and crowded context modeling. During the first stage, we averagely divide the spatiotemporal volume into atomic blocks. Considering the fact that mutual interference of several human body parts potentially happen in the same block, we propose an atomic motion pattern representation using the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to distinguish the motions inside each block in a refined way. Usual motion patterns can thus be defined as a certain type of steady motion activities appearing at specific scene positions. During the second stage, we further use the Markov Random Field (MRF) model to characterize the joint label distributions over all the adjacent local motion patterns inside the same crowded scene, aiming at modeling the severely occluded situations in a crowded scene accurately. By combining the determinations from the two stages, a weighted scheme is proposed to automatically detect anomaly events from crowded scenes. The experimental results on several different outdoor and indoor crowded scenes illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2014.383","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966883/6976709/06977095.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976709","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2014.383","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","startPage":"2203","endPage":"2208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection through Spatio-temporal Context Modeling in Crowded Scenes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977095","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection through Spatio-temporal Context Modeling in Crowded Scenes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977095/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6977095/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14809042","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection through Spatio-temporal Context Modeling in Crowded Scenes","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"5209c203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114847S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966883","isNumber":"6976709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966883","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6976709","articleId":"6977095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6977109,"authors":[{"name":"Ekaterina Riabchenko","affiliation":["Machine Vision and Pattern Recognition Laboratory, Lappeenranta University of Technology"],"firstName":"Ekaterina","lastName":"Riabchenko","id":"37085382304"},{"name":"Joni-Kristian K\u00e4m\u00e4r\u00e4inen","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology"],"firstName":"Joni-Kristian","lastName":"K\u00e4m\u00e4r\u00e4inen","id":"37268498700"},{"name":"Ke Chen","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085399377"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5209-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"6977109","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Gaussian mixture model","Face","Training","Motorcycles","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","Gabor filters","Gaussian processes","image resolution","matrix algebra","mixture models","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision problems","object detection","pose estimation","face recognition","object representation","probabilistic framework","class-specific object part learning","facial landmark detection","bioinspired multiresolution Gabor features","complex-valued Gabor filter responses","landmark specific likelihoods","GMM","response matrix shift operations","generative learning","randomised Gaussian mixture model","public benchmarking","Caltech-101 datasets","BioID datasets","object landmark localisation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977109","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2014.397","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2014.397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976709","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966883/6976709/06977109.pdf","startPage":"2287","endPage":"2292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Generative Models of Object Parts from a Few Positive Examples","abstract":"A number of computer vision problems such as object detection, pose estimation, and face recognition utilise local parts to represent objects, which include the distinguished information of objects.

In this paper, we exploit biological sequence alignment tools to classify 2D shapes, tailoring the biological parameters of these tools to account for the different semantic of the 2D shape scenario. In particular, we propose a novel substitution matrix, which is the crucial parameter determining the sequence alignment solution. The new matrix, called S-BLOSUM, learns the rates of matches/mismatches in conserved portions of shapes belonging to the same category, and incorporates prior knowledge on the chosen representation for the 2D shape. On one hand, the experimental evaluation showed that the S-BLOSUM provides a significant improvement over the biological counterpart (BLOSUM), on the other hand, classification results prove that our approach is competitive with respect to the state of the art.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966883/6976709/06977117.pdf","startPage":"2335","endPage":"2340","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2014.405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2014.405","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976709","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977117","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"S-BLOSUM: Classification of 2D Shapes with Biological Sequence Alignment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Matrices","Biological information theory","Pattern recognition","Accuracy","Bioinformatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","image classification","matrix algebra","shape recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["S-BLOSUM","2D shape classification","biological sequence alignment","bioinformatics","pattern recognition problem","substitution matrix"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977117/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"S-BLOSUM: Classification of 2D Shapes with Biological Sequence Alignment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6977117/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14794892","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"S-BLOSUM: Classification of 2D Shapes with Biological Sequence Alignment","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"5209c335.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057997S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966883","isNumber":"6976709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966883","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6976709","articleId":"6977117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6977160,"authors":[{"name":"A.M. \u00c1lvarez-Meza","affiliation":["Signal Processing and Recognition Group, Universidad Nacional de Colombia sede Manizales, Manizales, Colombia"],"firstName":"A.M.","lastName":"\u00c1lvarez-Meza","id":"38271454900"},{"name":"S.

Given a color natural scene image, six component-trees are built from its gray scale image, hue and saturation channel images in a perception-based illumination invariant color space, and their inverted images, respectively. From each component-tree, generalized color-enhanced CERs are extracted as character candidates. By using a \"divide-and-conquer\" strategy, each candidate image patch is labeled reliably by rules as one of five types, namely, Long, Thin, Fill, Square-large and Square-small, and classified as text or non-text by a corresponding neural network, which is trained by an ambiguity-free learning strategy. After pruning non-text components, repeating components in each component-tree are pruned by using color and area information to obtain a component graph, from which candidate text-lines are formed and verified by another set of neural networks. Finally, results from six component-trees are combined, and a post-processing step is used to recover lost characters and split text lines into words as appropriate.

The key tools adopted by the most methods are interest point detectors and descriptors, shared codes for object parts (visual codebook) and discriminative learning using positive and negative class examples. Distinction of our method from the existing part-based methods for object detection is the use of sparse class-specific landmarks with semantic meaning. The landmarks are the additional distinguished information of object location in the proposed framework. Additionally, localising semantic and discriminative landmarks (object parts) is significant in other related applications of computer vision, such as facial expression recognition and pose/orientation estimation of objects. Therefore, we propose a model which deviates from the mainstream by the fact that the object parts' appearance and spatial variation, constellation, are explicitly modelled in a generative probabilistic manner.

We use a pyramidal approach where at the first level, pixels are classified into: text, background, decoration, and out of page, at the second level, text regions are split into text line and non text line. Color and texture features based on Local Binary Patterns and Gabor Dominant Orientation are used for classification. By applying a modified Fast Correlation-Based Filter feature selection algorithm, redundant and irrelevant features are removed. Finally, the text line segmentation results are refined by a smoothing post-processing procedure. Unlike other projection profile or connected components methods, the proposed algorithm does not use any script-specific knowledge and is applicable to color images. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on three historical manuscript image datasets of diverse nature and achieved an average precision of 91% and recall of 84%. Experiments also show that the proposed algorithm is robust with respect to changes of the writing style, page layout, and noise on the image.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2014.514","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","startPage":"2978","endPage":"2983","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2014.514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976709","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966883/6976709/06977226.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Image color analysis","Feature extraction","Robustness","Vectors","Histograms","Color"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature selection","history","image colour analysis","image segmentation","image texture","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust text line segmentation","historical manuscript images","pyramidal approach","text pixels","background pixels","decoration pixels","out of page pixels","texture features","local binary patterns","Gabor dominant orientation","modified fast correlation-based filter feature selection algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Document Understanding","Segmentation","features and descriptors","Texture and color analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robust Text Line Segmentation for Historical Manuscript Images Using Color and Texture","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977226/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6977226/","accessionNumber":"14794879","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Text Line Segmentation for Historical Manuscript Images Using Color and Texture","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"5209c978.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065883S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966883","isNumber":"6976709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966883","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6976709","articleId":"6977226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6977241,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-An Hou","affiliation":["Research Center for IT Innovation Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-An","lastName":"Hou","id":"37085346175"},{"name":"Min-Chun Yang","affiliation":["Research Center for IT Innovation Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Min-Chun","lastName":"Yang","id":"38238464100"},{"name":"Yu-Chiang Frank Wang","affiliation":["Research Center for IT Innovation Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Chiang Frank","lastName":"Wang","id":"38195878100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5209-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"6977241","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":332},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Face recognition","Dictionaries","Image recognition","Training","Probes","Principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image classification","independent component analysis","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["domain adaptive self-taught learning approach","heterogeneous face recognition","image data recognition","HFR problems","novel domain-independent component analysis algorithm","improved representation ability","DiCA subspace","image representation","real-world cross-domain classification problems","visible spectrum face recognition problems","near-infrared face recognition problems"]}],"abstract":"Recognizing image data across different domains has been a challenging task. For biometrics, heterogeneous face recognition (HFR) deals with recognition problems in which training/gallery images are collected in terms of one modality (e.g., photos), while test/probe images are observed in the other (e.g., sketches). In this paper, we present a domain adaptation approach for solving HFR problems. By utilizing external face images (i.e., those collected from the subjects not of interest) from both source and target domains, we propose a novel Domain-independent Component Analysis (DiCA) algorithm for deriving a common subspace for relating and representing cross-domain image data. In order to introduce improved representation ability, we further advance the self-taught learning strategy for learning a domain-independent dictionary in our DiCA subspace, which can be applied to both gallery and probe images of interest to improve representation and recognition. Different from some prior domain-adaptation approaches, we do not require the data correspondences (i.e., data pairs) when collecting external cross-domain image data, nor the label information is needed for learning the common feature space when associating different domains. Thus, our method is practical for real-world cross-domain classification problems. In our experiments, we consider sketch-to-photo and near-infrared (NIR) to visible spectrum (VIS) face recognition problems for evaluating the performance of our proposed approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Domain Adaptive Self-Taught Learning for Heterogeneous Face Recognition","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2014.529","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966883/6976709/06977241.pdf","startPage":"3068","endPage":"3073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2014.529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976709","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977241","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977241/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Domain Adaptive Self-Taught Learning for Heterogeneous Face Recognition","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6977241/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14809166","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Domain Adaptive Self-Taught Learning for Heterogeneous Face Recognition","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"5209d068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058958S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966883","isNumber":"6976709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966883","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6976709","articleId":"6977241","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6977258,"authors":[{"name":"Le Kang","affiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Le","lastName":"Kang","id":"38022535800"},{"name":"Jayant Kumar","affiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Jayant","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37841533300"},{"name":"Peng Ye","affiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Ye","id":"38242386400"},{"name":"Yi Li","affiliation":["NICTA and ANU"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Li","id":"38240599800"},{"name":"David Doermann","affiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Doermann","id":"37271030100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5209-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"6977258","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":73,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1804},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Layout","Pattern recognition","Accuracy","NIST","Computer vision","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["document image processing","feature extraction","image classification","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural networks","CNN","document image classification","structural similarity","hand-crafted features","raw image pixels","document layout","rectified linear units","inner-class variations","public challenging datasets"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977258","abstract":"This paper presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for document image classification.

While most previous research within re-identification field is based on single-shot mode due to the constraint of scales of conventional datasets, multi-shot case provides a more natural way for person recognition in surveillance systems. Multiple frames can be easily captured in a camera network, thus more complementary information can be extracted for a more robust signature. To re-identify targets in real world, a key issue named identity ambiguity that commonly occurs must be solved preferentially, which is not considered by most previous studies. During the offline stage, we train an ambiguity classifier based on the shape context extracted from foreground responses in videos. Given a probe pedestrian, this paper employs the offline trained classifier to recognize and remove ambiguous samples, and then utilizes an improved hierarchical appearance representation to match humans between multiple-shots. Evaluations of this approach are conducted on two challenging real-world datasets, both of which are newly released in this paper, and yield impressive performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977321/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6977321/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14809145","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Multi-shot Person Re-identification with Automatic Ambiguity Inference and Removal","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-shot Person Re-identification with Automatic Ambiguity Inference and Removal","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"5209d540.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047177S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966883","isNumber":"6976709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966883","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6976709","articleId":"6977321","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6977352,"authors":[{"name":"Naveed Akhtar","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Software Engineering, The University of Western Australia, Crawley, WA"],"firstName":"Naveed","lastName":"Akhtar","id":"38242687700"},{"name":"Faisal Shafait","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Software Engineering, The University of Western Australia, Crawley, WA"],"firstName":"Faisal","lastName":"Shafait","id":"37284121200"},{"name":"Ajmal Mian","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Software Engineering, The University of Western Australia, Crawley, WA"],"firstName":"Ajmal","lastName":"Mian","id":"37283914600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5209-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"6977352","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Approximation methods","Approximation algorithms","Greedy algorithms","Matching pursuit algorithms","Dictionaries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","geophysical image processing","greedy algorithms","hyperspectral imaging","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SUnGP","greedy sparse approximation algorithm","hyperspectral unmixing","remote sensing hyper spectral sensor","subspace pruning strategy","convex relaxation"]}],"abstract":"Spectra measured at a pixel of a remote sensing hyper spectral sensor is usually a mixture of multiple spectra (end-members) of different materials on the ground. Hyper spectral unmixing aims at identifying the end members and their proportions (fractional abundances) in the mixed pixels. Hyper spectral unmixing has recently been casted into a sparse approximation problem and greedy sparse approximation approaches are considered desirable for solving it. However, the high correlation among the spectra of different materials seriously affects the accuracy of the greedy algorithms. We propose a greedy sparse approximation algorithm, called SUnGP, for unmixing of hyper spectral data. SUnGP shows high robustness against the correlation of the spectra of materials. The algorithm employees a subspace pruning strategy for the identification of the end members. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm not only outperforms the state of the art greedy algorithms, its accuracy is comparable to the algorithms based on the convex relaxation of the problem, but with a considerable computational advantage.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2014.640","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966883/6976709/06977352.pdf","startPage":"3726","endPage":"3731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2014.640","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SUnGP: A Greedy Sparse Approximation Algorithm for Hyperspectral Unmixing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977352","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977352/","displayDocTitle":"SUnGP: A Greedy Sparse Approximation Algorithm for Hyperspectral Unmixing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14808904","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6977352/","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SUnGP: A Greedy Sparse Approximation Algorithm for Hyperspectral Unmixing","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"5209d726.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065978S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966883","isNumber":"6976709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966883","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6976709","articleId":"6977352","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6977417,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Goldhammer","affiliation":["University of Applied Sciences Aschaffenburg, Aschaffenburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Goldhammer","id":"38493975600"},{"name":"Konrad Doll","affiliation":["University of Applied Sciences Aschaffenburg, Aschaffenburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Konrad","lastName":"Doll","id":"37547272700"},{"name":"Ulrich Brunsmann","affiliation":["University of Applied Sciences Aschaffenburg, Aschaffenburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Ulrich","lastName":"Brunsmann","id":"37541689600"},{"name":"Andr\u00e9 Gensler","affiliation":["Intelligent Embedded Systems Lab, University of Kassel, Kassel, Germany"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e9","lastName":"Gensler","id":"37085353440"},{"name":"Bernhard Sick","affiliation":["Intelligent Embedded Systems Lab, University of Kassel, Kassel, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernhard","lastName":"Sick","id":"37320920600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5209-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"6977417","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":779},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Vehicles","Polynomials","Kalman filters","Legged locomotion","Head","Magnetic heads"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["driver information systems","extrapolation","image sensors","learning (artificial intelligence)","least squares approximations","neural nets","object tracking","pedestrians","polynomial approximation","pose estimation","road traffic","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pedestrian short-time trajectory forecasting","public traffic","artificial neural network movement models","traffic safety applications","self-learning approach","polynomial extrapolation","least-squares error","real urban intersection","wide angle stereo camera setup","3D head tracking framework","position estimation error reduction","critical traffic scenes","concrete pedestrian-vehicle scenario","advanced driver assistant system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","movement models","pedestrian tracking","traffic safety","trajectory forecast"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977417","abstract":"This paper focuses on forecasting of pedestrian's short-time trajectories up to 2.5 s for traffic safety applications.

Trajectories of uninstructed pedestrians in public traffic at a real urban intersection are acquired by a wide angle stereo camera setup in combination with a 3D head tracking framework. Results using this real-world data show that the artificial neural network significantly improves forecast quality compared to other approaches especially for critical traffic scenes including velocity changes such as starting and stopping. For those velocity changes a reduction of position estimation errors of about 21% compared to the Kalman Filter and to extrapolation of polynomials is obtained. By means of a concrete pedestrian-vehicle scenario we demonstrate the benefit of the proposed approach for an advanced driver assistant system in terms of reaction time.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2014.704","startPage":"4110","endPage":"4115","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2014.704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976709","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966883/6976709/06977417.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pedestrian's Trajectory Forecast in Public Traffic with Artificial Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977417/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Pedestrian's Trajectory Forecast in Public Traffic with Artificial Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6977417/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14808638","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pedestrian's Trajectory Forecast in Public Traffic with Artificial Neural Networks","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"5209e110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063818S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966883","isNumber":"6976709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966883","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6976709","articleId":"6977417","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6977443,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Hui","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Data Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Hui","id":"37650240800"},{"name":"Zuo Qingsong","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Data Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zuo","lastName":"Qingsong","id":"37085516260"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5209-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"6977443","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"abstract":"A visual stimulus is represented by the biological visual system at several levels, from low to high levels they are, photoreceptor cells, GCs, LGN cells and visual cortical neurons. Retinal ganglion cells (GCs) at the early level need to represent raw data only once, but meet a wide number of diverse requests from different vision-based tasks. This means the information representation at this level is general and not task-specific. Neurobiological findings have attributed this universal adaptation to GCs' RF mechanisms. For the purposes of developing a highly efficient image representation method that can facilitate information processing and interpretation at later stages, here we design a computational model to simulate the GC's non-classical RF. This new image presentation method can extract major structural features from raw data, and is consistent with other statistical measures of the image. Based on the new representation, the performances of other state-of-the-art algorithms in segmentation can be upgraded remarkably. This work concludes that applying sophisticated representation schema at early state is an efficient and promising strategy in visual information processing.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966883/6976709/06977443.pdf","startPage":"4263","endPage":"4268","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2014.731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2014.731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976709","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977443","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bio-Inspired Early-Level Image Representation and Its Contribution to Object Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Image segmentation","Image representation","Object recognition","Visualization","Computational modeling","Biology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image representation","image segmentation","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinspired early-level image representation","object recognition","visual stimulus","biological visual system","retinal ganglion cells","neurobiological findings","computational model","image presentation method","image segmentation","visual information processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image representation","Segmentation","Object recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977443/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Bio-Inspired Early-Level Image Representation and Its Contribution to Object Recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6977443/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14809104","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bio-Inspired Early-Level Image Representation and Its Contribution to Object Recognition","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"5209e263.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084561S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966883","isNumber":"6976709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966883","xplore-issue":"6976709","articleId":"6977443","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6977479,"authors":[{"name":"Iacopo Masi","affiliation":["MICC, University of Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Iacopo","lastName":"Masi","id":"37542277700"},{"name":"Claudio Ferrari","affiliation":["MICC, University of Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Ferrari","id":"37085546106"},{"name":"Alberto Del Bimbo","affiliation":["MICC, Univ. of Florence, Firenze, Toscana, IT"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Del Bimbo","id":"37275525200"},{"name":"Gerard Medioni","affiliation":["USC IRIS Lab, University of Southern California Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Gerard","lastName":"Medioni","id":"37085356778"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5209-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"6977479","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":222},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Face recognition","Three-dimensional displays","Solid modeling","Deformable models","Probes","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","pose estimation","regression analysis","solid modelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pose independent face recognition","local binary pattern localization","deformation components","gallery set","frontal face image","probe set","face image","pose variations","3D morphable model","3DMM","ridge regression solution","PCA","local binary pattern histograms","LBP","CMU multiPIE","face recognition algorithm","continuous pose variations"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we address the problem of pose independent face recognition with a gallery set containing one frontal face image per enrolled subject while the probe set is composed by just a face image undergoing pose variations. The approach uses a set of aligned 3D models to learn deformation components using a 3D Morph able Model (3DMM). This further allows fitting a 3DMM efficiently on an image using a Ridge regression solution, regularized on the face space estimated via PCA. Then the approach describes each profile face by computing Local Binary Pattern (LBP) histograms localized on each deformed vertex, projected on a rendered frontal view. In the experimental result we evaluate the proposed method on the CMU Multi-PIE to assess face recognition algorithm across pose. We show how our process leads to higher performance than regular baselines reporting high recognition rate considering a range of facial poses in the probe set, up to \u00b145\u00b0.

Recognizing faces in a watch list is a challenging problem in semi - and unconstrained surveillance environments due to the lack of control over capture and operational conditions, and to the limited number of reference stills. This paper provides a performance baseline and guidelines for ensemble-based systems using a single high-quality reference still per individual, as found in many watch list screening applications. In particular, modular systems are considered, where an ensemble of template matchers based on multiple face representations is assigned to each individual of interest. During enrollment, multiple feature extraction (FE) techniques are applied to patches isolated in the reference still to generate diverse face-part representations that are robust to various nuisance factors (e.g., illumination and pose) encountered in video surveillance. The selection of relevant feature subsets, decision thresholds, and fusion functions of ensembles are achieved using faces of non-target individuals selected from reference videos (forming a universal background model). During operations, a face tracker gradually regroups faces captured from different people appearing in a scene, while each user-specific ensemble generates a decision per face capture. This leads to robust spatio-temporal FR when accumulated ensemble predictions surpass a detection threshold. Simulation results obtained with the Chokepoint video dataset show a significant improvement to accuracy, (1) when performing score-level fusion of matchers, where patches-based and FE techniques generate ensemble diversity, (2) when defining feature subsets and decision thresholds for each individual matcher of an ensemble using non-target videos, and (3) when accumulating positive detections over multiple frames.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966883/6976709/06977481.pdf","startPage":"4489","endPage":"4494","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2014.768","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2014.768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976709","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Watch-List Screening Using Ensembles Based on Multiple Face Representations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Principal component analysis","Iron","Feature extraction","Robustness","Cameras","Video sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","image matching","image representation","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple face representations","still-to-video face recognition","video surveillance cameras","unconstrained surveillance environments","semiconstrained surveillance environments","performance baseline","single high-quality reference","watchlist screening applications","template matchers","feature extraction techniques","multiple FE techniques","nuisance factors","relevant feature subsets","decision thresholds","fusion functions","nontarget individuals","reference videos","universal background model","face tracker","robust spatiotemporal FR","detection threshold","chokepoint video dataset","patches-based techniques","ensemble diversity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977481/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Watch-List Screening Using Ensembles Based on Multiple Face Representations","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6977481/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14809147","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Watch-List Screening Using Ensembles Based on Multiple Face Representations","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"5209e489.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087422S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966883","isNumber":"6976709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966883","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6976709","articleId":"6977481","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6977485,"authors":[{"name":"Georgios Evangelidis","affiliation":["INRIA Grenoble Rhone-Alpes 655, Montbonnot Saint-Martin, FRANCE"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Evangelidis","id":"37062481300"},{"name":"Gurkirt Singh","affiliation":["INRIA Grenoble Rhone-Alpes 655, Montbonnot Saint-Martin, FRANCE"],"firstName":"Gurkirt","lastName":"Singh","id":"37085373289"},{"name":"Radu Horaud","affiliation":["INRIA Grenoble Rhone-Alpes 655, Montbonnot Saint-Martin, FRANCE"],"firstName":"Radu","lastName":"Horaud","id":"37298445500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5209-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"6977485","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":147,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1076},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Joints","Vectors","Accuracy","Kernel","Training","Three-dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","Gaussian processes","image motion analysis","image recognition","image representation","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["skeletal quads","human action recognition","joint quadruples","human motion analysis","human skeleton structure extraction","depth images","local skeleton descriptor","similarity normalisation transform","compact 6D view-invariant skeletal feature","Fisher kernel representation","Gaussian mixture model","Fisher vector","multilevel representation","action description","linear SVM","MSRAction3D datasets","HDM05 datasets"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977485","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2014.772","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","abstract":"Recent advances on human motion analysis have made the extraction of human skeleton structure feasible, even from single depth images.

In this context, we propose a local skeleton descriptor that encodes the relative position of joint quadruples. Such a coding implies a similarity normalisation transform that leads to a compact (6D) view-invariant skeletal feature, referred to as skeletal quad. Further, the use of a Fisher kernel representation is suggested to describe the skeletal quads contained in a (sub)action. A Gaussian mixture model is learnt from training data, so that the generation of any set of quads is encoded by its Fisher vector. Finally, a multi-level representation of Fisher vectors leads to an action description that roughly carries the order of sub-action within each action sequence. Efficient classification is here achieved by linear SVMs. The proposed action representation is tested on widely used datasets, MSRAction3D and HDM05. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms that rely only on joints, while it competes with methods that combine joints with extra cues.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2014.772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976709","startPage":"4513","endPage":"4518","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966883/6976709/06977485.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Skeletal Quads: Human Action Recognition Using Joint Quadruples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977485/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6977485/","displayDocTitle":"Skeletal Quads: Human Action Recognition Using Joint Quadruples","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14809119","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Skeletal Quads: Human Action Recognition Using Joint Quadruples","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"5209e513.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089432S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966883","isNumber":"6976709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966883","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"6976709","articleId":"6977485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6977502,"authors":[{"name":"Marinella Cadoni","affiliation":["PolComIng Department, University of Sassari, Sassari, Italy"],"firstName":"Marinella","lastName":"Cadoni","id":"37085410120"},{"name":"Andrea Lagorio","affiliation":["PolComIng Department, University of Sassari, Sassari, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Lagorio","id":"37332810300"},{"name":"Enrico Grosso","affiliation":["PolComIng Department, University of Sassari, Sassari, Italy"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Grosso","id":"37271353800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5209-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"6977502","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"abstract":"When dealing with face recognition, multimodal algorithms, with their potential to capture complementary characteristics from the 2D and 3D data channels, can reach high level of efficiency and robustness. In this paper, we explore different combinations of iconic descriptors coupled with a shape descriptor and propose a fully automatic, multimodal, face recognition paradigm. Two iconic features extractors, the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and the Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF), are used, in turn, to extract salient points from the images of the faces. The corresponding points on the scans are validated with Joint Differential Invariants, a 3D characterisation method based on local and global shape information. SIFT and SURF are then combined at feature level and the 3D Joint Differential Invariants used to validate them on the shape channel. The proposed method has been tested on the FRGCv2 database. Experimental results highlight the complementarity of the feature points extracted by SIFT and SURF and the effectiveness of their 3D validation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966883/6976709/06977502.pdf","startPage":"4612","endPage":"4617","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2014.789","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2014.789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976709","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iconic Methods for Multimodal Face Recognition: A Comparative Study","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Three-dimensional displays","Feature extraction","Vectors","Face recognition","Probes","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","transforms","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimodal face recognition","complementary characteristics","2D data channels","3D data channels","iconic descriptors","shape descriptor","iconic features extractors","scale invariant feature transform","SIFT","SURF","speeded-up robust features","salient point extraction","joint differential invariants","local shape information","global shape information","feature level","shape channel","FRGCv2 database","3D validation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977502/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Iconic Methods for Multimodal Face Recognition: A Comparative Study","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6977502/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14809018","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iconic Methods for Multimodal Face Recognition: A Comparative Study","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"5209e612.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061369S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966883","isNumber":"6976709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966883","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6976709","articleId":"6977502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6977507,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan-Kai Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University"],"firstName":"Yuan-Kai","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281442900"},{"name":"Ching-Tang Fan","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Applied Science and Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University"],"firstName":"Ching-Tang","lastName":"Fan","id":"37596594200"},{"name":"Jian-Fu Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University"],"firstName":"Jian-Fu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085562159"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5209-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"6977507","dbTime":"59 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":510},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Feature extraction","Histograms","Vehicle dynamics","Image quality","Image motion analysis","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image classification","image recognition","image sequences","object detection","probability","road traffic","traffic engineering computing","video cameras","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic camera anomaly detection method","camera tampering detection","video surveillance","camera malfunction","traffic cameras","vehicle monitoring","license plate recognition","traffic flow","traffic crowd","traffic scene","normal surveillance scene","image quality","low-level features","no-referenced metrics","image dynamics","mid-level features","optical flow histogram distribution","two-stage classifier","video dynamics","probabilistic state transition","urban surveillance scenarios","false alarm rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["camera anomaly","camera tampering","camera sabotage","traffic camera","state transition system"]}],"abstract":"Detection of camera anomaly and tampering have attracted increasing interest in video surveillance for real-time alert of camera malfunction. However, the anomaly detection for traffic cameras monitoring vehicles and recognizing license plates has not been formally studied and it cannot be solved by existing methods. In this paper, we propose a camera anomaly detection method for traffic scene that has distinct characteristics of dynamics due to traffic flow and traffic crowd, compared with normal surveillance scene. Image quality used as low-level features are measured by no-referenced metrics. Image dynamics used as mid-level features are computed by histogram distribution of optical flow. A two-stage classifier for the detection of anomaly is devised by the modeling of image quality and video dynamics with probabilistic state transition. The proposed approach is robust to many challenging issues in urban surveillance scenarios and has very low false alarm rate. Experiments are conducted on real-world videos recorded in traffic scene including the situations of high traffic flow and severe crowding. Our test results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to previous methods on both precision rate and false alarm rate for the anomaly detection of traffic cameras.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2014.794","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966883/6976709/06977507.pdf","startPage":"4642","endPage":"4647","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2014.794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic Camera Anomaly Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977507","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977507/","displayDocTitle":"Traffic Camera Anomaly Detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14809020","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6977507/","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic Camera Anomaly Detection","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"5209e642.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068421S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966883","isNumber":"6976709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966883","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6976709","articleId":"6977507","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6977512,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Chen","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085399377"},{"name":"Joni-Kristian K\u00e4m\u00e4r\u00e4inen","affiliation":["Tampereen yliopisto - Hervannan kampus, Tampere, Pirkanmaa, FI"],"firstName":"Joni-Kristian","lastName":"K\u00e4m\u00e4r\u00e4inen","id":"37268498700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5209-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"6977512","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Feature extraction","Vectors","Measurement uncertainty","Mathematical model","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","data mining","feature extraction","pedestrians","regression analysis","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagated information","error back-propagation","principled learning strategies","pattern recognition","machine learning","neural networks","performance criteria","object function","supervised model-learning","learning-with-the-privileged information","LPI","regression-based framework","data mining","fitting performance","low-level imagery features","intermediary semantic attributes","pedestrian counting","public UCSD benchmarks","public Mall benchmarks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977512","abstract":"Error back-propagation is one of the principled learning strategies widely used in pattern recognition and machine learning, e.g. neural networks.

It intrigues psychologists and computer scientists' (especially on computer vision and pattern recognition) interests due to its promising applications in various fields. Recent research reveals that color may provide useful information for expression recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel color space model, Tensor Independent Color Space (TICS), for enhancing the performance of micro-expression recognition. An micro-expression color video clip is treated as a fourth-order tensor, i.e. a four-dimension array. The first two dimensions are the spatial information, the third is the temporal information, and the fourth is the color information. We transform the fourth dimension from RGB into TICS, in which the color components are as independent as possible. The combination of dynamic texture in the independent color components can get higher accuracy than that in RGB. In addition, we define a set of Regions of Interest (ROIs) based on Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and calculated the dynamic texture histograms for each ROI. The experiments are conducted on two micro-expression databases, CASME and CASME 2, and the results show that the performance in TICS is better than that in RGB or gray.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2014.800","publicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966883/6976709/06977513.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2014.800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6976709","startPage":"4678","endPage":"4683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Micro-expression Recognition Using Dynamic Textures on Tensor Independent Color Space","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977513","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Micro-expression Recognition Using Dynamic Textures on Tensor Independent Color Space","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977513/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14809137","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6977513/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Micro-expression Recognition Using Dynamic Textures on Tensor Independent Color Space","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"5209e678.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095598S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966883","isNumber":"6976709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966883","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6976709","articleId":"6977513","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6977564,"authors":[{"name":"Li Weihong","affiliation":["South China Normal University, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Weihong","id":"37601918700"},{"name":"Zhang Ao","affiliation":["South China University of Technology, guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Ao","id":"37085419377"},{"name":"Dai Kan","affiliation":["South China Normal University, guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Dai","lastName":"Kan","id":"37085420723"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4261-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-4262-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6977564","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose an efficient Bayesian framework based place name segmentation algorithm which is suitable to be used in geocoding system.

The proposed place name segmentaton algorithm aims to calculate the logic by which the word segmentation problem can be solved effectively. We use the Bayesian framework to describe the statistical laws in the word segmentation problem, and the hypothesis space for the Bayesian framework consists of all the possible schemes of which probability are assigned to each word in the dictionary. Finally, word segmentation can be obtained by solving an optimization problem. Furthermore, experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Fifth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Engineering Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968681/6977522/06977564.pdf","startPage":"141","endPage":"144","publicationTitle":"2014 Fifth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Engineering Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISDEA.2014.39","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISDEA.2014.39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6977522","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Bayesian Framework Based Place Name Segmentation Algorithm for Geocoding System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Geographic information systems","Bayes methods","Algorithm design and analysis","Databases","Quantization (signal)","Dictionaries","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","geographic information systems","geophysical image processing","image coding","image segmentation","probability","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian framework based place name segmentation algorithm","geocoding system","address quantization process","quantization rules","word segmentation problem","statistical laws","probability","optimization problem","dictionary"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bayesian framework","Geocoding system","Word segmentation","Place name"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977564/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 June 2014","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Bayesian Framework Based Place Name Segmentation Algorithm for Geocoding System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6977564/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14817889","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","conferenceDate":"15-16 June 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Bayesian Framework Based Place Name Segmentation Algorithm for Geocoding System","confLoc":"Hunan, China","sourcePdf":"4261a141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038595S","chronDate":"15-16 June 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968681","isNumber":"6977522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968681","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6977522","articleId":"6977564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6977570,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Jieping","affiliation":["Guangxi Vocational and Technical College, Nanning"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Jieping","id":"37946306700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4261-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-4262-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6977570","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":354},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Training","OFDM","Signal processing algorithms","Estimation","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","receiving antennas","synchronisation","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved training sequence","timing synchronization algorithm","MIMO OFDM System","modified training sequence","sender module","receiver module","transmitting antenna","timing offset estimation function","sending antenna","receiving antenna"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM system","Training sequence","Timing synchronization","Timing offset estimation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977570","abstract":"In order to obtain the best possible time instant for the start of received frame, in this paper, we concentrate on designing an effective timing synchronization algorithm based on a modified training sequence for the MIMO-OFDM systems.

Most previous studies have seldom quantified the location selections of Taiwanese IC design firms engaging in foreign direct investments in China because their access to crucial data may have been limited. This work developed a novel diffusion model to illustrate the extension of IC design clusters from Taiwan to China and chose foreign direct investment (FDI) as a quantitative indicator to measure the size of Taiwanese IC design industrial clusters in different Chinese regions. This study aims to understand what the distinctions in the process of FDI implementation are among the Taiwanese IC design companies which choose different Chinese regions to engage in FDIs. We also modified the conventional Bass model by optimizing parameters using genetic algorithm (GA) in conjunction with nonlinear least square method. The simulation is iterated 3,000 times. Finally, t-statistics were used to compare clustering features between the eastern and southern China areas. Simulation results demonstrate negligible standard deviation in the optimized parameters, which confirms the reliability of our findings. Furthermore, comparison results demonstrate that the Bass model optimized by GA integrated with NLS approach is more stable and accurate than the Bass model optimized by GA. The proposed approach is applicable to other high-tech industries and other locations around the world.","doi":"10.1109/ISDEA.2014.120","startPage":"507","endPage":"510","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Fifth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Engineering Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968681/6977522/06977650.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 Fifth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Engineering Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISDEA.2014.120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6977522","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forecasting Foreign Direct Investment by Using Bass Diffusion Model Integrated with Genetic Algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Integrated circuit modeling","Optimization","Industries","Accuracy","Forecasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["economic forecasting","industrial economics","investment","least squares approximations","pattern clustering","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NLS approach","clustering features","t-statistics","nonlinear least square method","GA","Chinese regions","quantitative indicator","FDI implementation","IC design clusters","Taiwanese IC design firms","location selections","high-tech industries","strategic development","industrial clusters","genetic algorithms","bass diffusion model","foreign direct investment forecasting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Diffusion model","Forecast accuracy","Nonlinear least square","Oordinary differential equation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977650/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 June 2014","displayDocTitle":"Forecasting Foreign Direct Investment by Using Bass Diffusion Model Integrated with Genetic Algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6977650/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","conferenceDate":"15-16 June 2014","accessionNumber":"14817851","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forecasting Foreign Direct Investment by Using Bass Diffusion Model Integrated with Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Hunan, China","sourcePdf":"4261a507.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054819S","chronDate":"15-16 June 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968681","isNumber":"6977522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968681","xplore-issue":"6977522","articleId":"6977650","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6977651,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Yin","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Physics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Yin","id":"37085433641"},{"name":"Zhang Kai","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Physics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Kai","id":"37085440811"},{"name":"Dong Jinping","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Physics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Jinping","id":"37085431369"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4261-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-4262-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6977651","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":225},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Digital signal processing","SDRAM","Noise","Digital filters","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data acquisition","digital control","digital signal processing chips","DRAM chips","field programmable gate arrays","magnetic bearings","network synthesis","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based expanded circuit design","DSP signal processing","digital control system","magnetic bearings","switching currents","power amplifier","SDRAM","signal oversampling","data processing","reduced signal noise","data acquisition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["data acquisition","FPGA","DSP","AD","DA"]}],"abstract":"In a digital control system for magnetic bearings, because of factors such as switching currents of a power amplifier, an input signal of the system will be mixed with noise and the signal should be filtered. If the sampling rate of the system for the input signal is not high enough, a filter used will introduce a large delay between its output and input signal. To solve this problem, one way is to sample the input signal multiple times at the beginning of every control period and get a filtered signal by average methods. Then the response speed of the bearing controller would not be influenced. A FPGA-based expanded circuit was designed for this purpose and it was added to a DSP control board as a component of the control platform. Without increasing computational burden of the DSP, the FPGA obtained oversampled signals and processed them by its rich on-chip resources. Meanwhile, in order to view the sampled signals and monitor the system online, the circuit was also equipped with a SDRAM to store the sampled data. This design had a simple structure and reliable performance. Experimental results showed that the circuit could achieve the required signal oversampling and the subsequent data processing and the signal noise was effectively reduced.","doi":"10.1109/ISDEA.2014.121","publicationTitle":"2014 Fifth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Engineering Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Fifth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Engineering Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968681/6977522/06977651.pdf","startPage":"511","endPage":"516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISDEA.2014.121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6977522","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-Based Expanded Circuit Design for DSP Signal Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977651","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 June 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977651/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-Based Expanded Circuit Design for DSP Signal Processing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14817901","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6977651/","conferenceDate":"15-16 June 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-Based Expanded Circuit Design for DSP Signal Processing","confLoc":"Hunan, China","sourcePdf":"4261a511.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044976S","chronDate":"15-16 June 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968681","isNumber":"6977522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968681","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6977522","articleId":"6977651","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6977652,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang Changfan","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Hunan University of Technology, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Changfan","id":"37427562700"},{"name":"Zhang Miaoying","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Hunan University of Technology, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Miaoying","id":"37085452983"},{"name":"Zhang Faming","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Hunan University of Technology, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Faming","id":"37085453279"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4261-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-4262-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6977652","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":22},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","cellular neural nets","delays","Lyapunov methods","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global exponential stability","variable time-delay cellular neural networks","activation function","special Lyapunov function equality","matrix inequality","likewise linear function","computer simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lyapunov function","Cellular neural networks","exponential stability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977652","abstract":"In view of variable time-delay cellular neural networks with activation function bounded and meeting the conditions of Lippschitz, the result of the global exponential stability is obtained by constructing a special Lyapunov function equality and using Lyapunov function technology and matrix inequality.

The index system for large scale sports events risk assessment is proposed in advance, which is made up of three categories: 1) risk before match, 2) risk in match and 3) risk after match. Particularly, eighteen influencing factors are design which can cover all aspects of the large scale sports events risk assessment. Structure of the hybrid neural network is contructed by three layers, which are \"the input layer\", \"the hidden layer\", and \"the output layer\". Particularly, the output layers can compute the regression function values, and the regression function of the artificial neural network can be computed through a linear integration of some nonlinear basis functions. Afterwards, utilizing a training dataset and its updating version, values of the decision functions of the multi-class support vector classifier can be obtained by the regression functions based on the artificial neural network. Finally, experiments are conducted to test the effectiveness of our algorithm. The conclusions can be drawn that compared with the artificial neural network, the proposed hybrid neural network is more suitable for the risk assessment of large scale sports events.","doi":"10.1109/ISDEA.2014.124","startPage":"524","endPage":"527","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Fifth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Engineering Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968681/6977522/06977654.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 Fifth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Engineering Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISDEA.2014.124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6977522","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Neural Network Based Risk Assessment Method for Large Scale Sports Events","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Risk management","Artificial neural networks","Indexes","Support vector machines","Training","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","pattern classification","regression analysis","risk management","sport","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid artificial neural network based risk assessment method","large scale sports events","sports management","risk before match","risk-in-match","risk after match","input layer","hidden layer","output layer","regression function values","nonlinear basis functions","training dataset","decision functions","multiclass support vector classifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial neural network","Hybrid neural network","Risk assessment","Sports events","Nonlinear basis function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977654/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 June 2014","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Neural Network Based Risk Assessment Method for Large Scale Sports Events","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6977654/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","conferenceDate":"15-16 June 2014","accessionNumber":"14817767","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Neural Network Based Risk Assessment Method for Large Scale Sports Events","confLoc":"Hunan, China","sourcePdf":"4261a524.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040338S","chronDate":"15-16 June 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968681","isNumber":"6977522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968681","xplore-issue":"6977522","articleId":"6977654","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6977696,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Yang","affiliation":["AVIC Shanghai AERO Measurement-Controlling Research Institute, Shanghai, China","Wuhan Polytechnic University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085469385"},{"name":"Caixia Yang","affiliation":["AVIC Shanghai AERO Measurement-Controlling Research Institute, Shanghai, China","Wuhan Polytechnic University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Caixia","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085475733"},{"name":"Yuliu","affiliation":["AVIC Shanghai AERO Measurement-Controlling Research Institute, China","Wuhan Polytechnic University, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Yuliu","id":"37087480739"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4261-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-4262-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6977696","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization with Simulated Binary Crossover","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Fifth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Engineering Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968681/6977522/06977696.pdf","startPage":"710","endPage":"713","publicationTitle":"2014 Fifth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Engineering Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISDEA.2014.161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6977522","doi":"10.1109/ISDEA.2014.161","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","search problems","swarm intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","intelligent search technique","swarm intelligence","complex multimodal problem","simulated binary crossover operator","SCPSO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","evolutionary algorithms","swarm intelligence","global optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977696","abstract":"Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a new intelligent search technique, which is inspired by swarm intelligence.

Accelerometer threshold-based algorithms lack adaptability and have not been tested for transitions between locomotion states. We describe a new approach for toe off identification using one accelerometer in over ground and ramp walking, including transitions. The method uses invariant foot acceleration features in the segment of gait, where toe off is probable. Wavelet analysis of foot acceleration is used to derive a unique feature in a particular frequency band, yielding estimated toe off occurrence. We tested the new method for five conditions: over ground walking (W), ramp ascending (RA), ramp descending (RD); transitions between states (W-RA, W-RD). Mean absolute estimation error was 17.4 \u00b1 12.5, 13.8 \u00b1 8.5, and 22.0 \u00b1 16.4 ms for steady states W, RA, and RD, 20.1 \u00b1 15.5, and 17.1 \u00b1 13.7 ms for transitions W-RA and W-RD, respectively.

The design relies on a novel phaseless monostatic element comprising a transmitter and a receiver. This element, together with a computationally inexpensive algorithm, can retrieve the phase of the monostatic scattered field at all the working band except for two small safety margins at the lower and upper frequencies. Furthermore, the phase retrieval works independently of the transmitter/receiver position. Consequently, conventional approaches to reduce the number of monostatic acquisition points can be employed. Thus, the proposed strategy is suitable to implement either arrays that benefit from a reduced number of low-complexity elements or raster scan systems that benefit not only from the cost reduction of the scanning components but also from a remarkable speed-up due to the reduced number of acquisition points. Moreover, in contrast to other off-axis schemes, the proposed system does not require neither mechanical nor electrical phase shifting and, therefore, it can be directly adapted to a large number of frequency bands. The performance of the system is validated by simulation and measurement examples in the millimeter-wave band.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7027885/06977900.pdf","startPage":"573","endPage":"584","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2014.2378262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2014.2378262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7027885","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977900","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phaseless Synthetic Aperture Radar With Efficient Sampling for Broadband Near-Field Imaging: Theory and Validation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Holography","Transmitters","Receivers","Synthetic aperture radar","Antenna measurements","Probes","Attenuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar imaging","radar receivers","radar transmitters","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phaseless synthetic aperture radar","broadband synthetic aperture radar","efficient sampling","broadband near-field imaging","phaseless monostatic element","monostatic scattered field","transmitter-receiver position","monostatic acquisition points","low complexity elements","raster scan systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Indirect holography","Leith-Upatnieks","multi-monostatic radar","non-redundant sampling","phase retrieval","synthetic aperture radar"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977900/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Phaseless Synthetic Aperture Radar With Efficient Sampling for Broadband Near-Field Imaging: Theory and Validation","volume":"63","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6977900/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14914949","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion of Spain FEDER"},{"fundingName":"Gobierno del Principado de Asturias PCTIFEDER-FSE"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phaseless Synthetic Aperture Radar With Efficient Sampling for Broadband Near-Field Imaging: Theory and Validation","sourcePdf":"tap-laviada-2378262-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.246976S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7027885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7027885","articleId":"6977900","onlineDate":"05 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6977905,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-Hao Chen","affiliation":["Department of Photonics and the Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shih-Hao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085387866"},{"name":"Chi-Wai Chow","affiliation":["Department of Photonics and the Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Wai","lastName":"Chow","id":"37277378700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0655"},{"format":"CD","value":"1943-0647"}],"articleNumber":"6977905","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":109,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":5506},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"(a) Tx and (b) Rx (mobile-phone camera).","type":"graphic","fileSize":"149KB","file":"/ielx7/4563994/6935058/6977905/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2374612.gif","coverImage":"/ielx7/4563994/6935058/6977905/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2374612.gif"},"abstract":"Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have been deployed for various applications in our daily lives. Similarly, image sensors or cameras integrated into mobile phones have become common. Hence, visible light communication (VLC) using LED and mobile phone cameras is attractive and provides low-cost wireless communication. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a VLC system using color-shift-keying (CSK) modulation and code-division multiple-access (CDMA) technology simultaneously for the first time; a mobile phone camera is used as the receiver (Rx). CSK is used to enhance the VLC system capacity and to mitigate the single color light interference, whereas CDMA allows multiple users to access the network. The system design and operation mechanism of the proposed CSK-CDMA VLC system are discussed. A proof-of-concept demonstration is performed, and error-free transmission is achieved for multiple-access users. A 3-dB transmission gain is also obtained in each user when compared with the traditional on-off keying (OOK) modulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/6935058/06977905.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2374612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2374612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6935058","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977905","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Color-Shift Keying and Code-Division Multiple-Access Transmission for RGB-LED Visible Light Communications Using Mobile Phone Camera","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Multiaccess communication","Bit error rate","Optical fiber communication","CMOS integrated circuits","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","code division multiple access","image sensors","light emitting diodes","light interference","mobile handsets","optical communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["color shift keying modulation","CSK modulation","code division multiple access transmission","CDMA","RGB-LED visible light communications","mobile phone camera","light emitting diodes","image sensors","low-cost wireless communication","single color light interference","error free transmission","multiple access users","gain 3 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Free space communication","Optical communications","Light emitting diode (LED)"]},{"kwd":["Free-space communication","optical communications","light-emitting diode (LED)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977905/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Color-Shift Keying and Code-Division Multiple-Access Transmission for RGB-LED Visible Light Communications Using Mobile Phone Camera","volume":"6","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6977905/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14816656","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","externalId":"7904106","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002855","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002338","fundingName":"Ministry of Education, Taiwan"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Color-Shift Keying and Code-Division Multiple-Access Transmission for RGB-LED Visible Light Communications Using Mobile Phone Camera","sourcePdf":"jphot-chow-2374612-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057402S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"6935058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"6935058","articleId":"6977905","onlineDate":"05 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":6977916,"authors":[{"name":"Esteve Amat","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya (UPC), Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/7430016/6977916/amat-small.gif","p":["Esteve Amat received the MSc and PhD degrees in electronic\n engineering from the Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona (UAB), Barcelona, Spain, in 2004 and 2009, respectively.\n He is currently with the Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya (UPC), Barcelona.

The model is derived in rotating the d- q coordinate frame, and the coordinate frame at double the fundamental frequency, in steady state. A substantial analytical basis is presented in order to facilitate direct mathematical manipulations of nonlinear terms in the rotating frame. An eighth-order model is first derived which includes circulating current representation. Later, the circulating current suppression controller (CCSC) is modelled and the magnitude of second harmonic control inputs is studied.

The entire inverter rating of the PV solar farm, which remains dormant during nighttime, is utilized with voltage and damping controls to enhance stable power transmission limits. During daytime, the inverter capacity left after real power production is used to accomplish the aforementioned objective. Transient stability studies are conducted on a realistic single machine infinite bus power system having a midpoint located PV-STATCOM using EMTDC/PSCAD simulation software. The PV-STATCOM improves the stable transmission limits substantially in the night and in the day even while generating large amounts of real power. Power transfer increases are also demonstrated in the same power system for: 1) two solar farms operating as PV-STATCOMs and 2) a solar farm as PV-STATCOM and an inverter-based wind farm with similar STATCOM controls. This novel utilization of a PV solar farm asset can thus improve power transmission limits which would have otherwise required expensive additional equipment, such as series/shunt capacitors or separate flexible ac transmission system controllers.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Inverters","Automatic voltage control","Generators","Control systems","Reactive power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible AC transmission systems","invertors","photovoltaic power systems","power generation control","power system interconnection","power system transient stability","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PV solar farm control","PV-STATCOM","grid power transmission limits","photovoltaic solar farm inverter","power transfer limits","interconnected transmission system","damping controls","voltage controls","inverter capacity","power production","transient stability","single machine infinite bus power system","EMTDC-PSCAD simulation software","power transfer","inverter-based wind farm","STATCOM controls","PV solar farm","flexible ac transmission system controllers","series-shunt capacitors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Damping control","flexible ac transmission systems (FACTS)","inverter","photovoltaic solar power systems","reactive power control","STATCOM","transmission capacity","voltage control","wind power system"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2014.2375216","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel7/61/7064681/06977939.pdf","startPage":"755","endPage":"763","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7064681","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2014.2375216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Control of PV Solar Farm as STATCOM (PV-STATCOM) for Increasing Grid Power Transmission Limits During Night and Day","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977939","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New Control of PV Solar Farm as STATCOM (PV-STATCOM) for Increasing Grid Power Transmission Limits During Night and Day","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977939/","volume":"30","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6977939/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15012907","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Control of PV Solar Farm as STATCOM (PV-STATCOM) for Increasing Grid Power Transmission Limits During Night and Day","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-varma-2375216-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118261S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"7064681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"7064681","articleId":"6977939","onlineDate":"05 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6977941,"authors":[{"name":"Dilip Bethanabhotla","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7010064/6977941/betha-2378774_print-small.gif","p":["\nDilip Bethanabhotla received the B.Tech degree in electronics and\ncommunication engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India, in 2010.

In such networks, any user is typically in the range of multiple helpers. Hence, an efficient policy should allow the users to dynamically select the helper nodes to download from and determine adaptively the quality level of the requested video segment. In order to obtain a tractable formulation, we follow a \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d approach. First, we formulate a network utility maximization (NUM) problem where the network utility function is a concave and component-wise nondecreasing function of the time-averaged users' requested video quality index, and maximization is subject to the stability of all queues in the system. Second, we solve the NUM problem by using a Lyapunov drift plus penalty approach, obtaining a dynamic adaptive scheme that decomposes into two building blocks: 1) adaptive video quality and helper selection (run at the user nodes); and 2) dynamic allocation of the helper-to-user transmission rates (run at the help nodes). Our solution provably achieves NUM optimality in a strong per-sample path sense (i.e., without assumptions of stationarity and ergodicity). Third, we observe that, since all queues in the system are stable, all requested video chunks shall be eventually delivered. Fourth, in order to translate the requested video quality into the effective video quality at the user playback, it is necessary that the chunks are delivered within their playback deadline. This requires that the largest delay among all queues at the helpers serving any given user is less than the pre-buffering time of that user at its streaming session startup phase. In order to achieve this condition with high probability, we propose an effective and decentralized (albeit heuristic) scheme to adaptively calculate the pre-buffering and re-buffering time at each user. In this way, the system is forced to work in the \u201csmooth streaming regime,\u201d i.e., in the regime of very small playback buffer underrun rate. Through simulations, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm under realistic assumptions of a network with densely deployed helper and user nodes, including user mobility, variable bit-rate video coding, and users joining or leaving the system at arbitrary times.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2378774","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2378774","startPage":"268","endPage":"285","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7010064/06977941.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7010064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Video Streaming for Wireless Networks With Multiple Users and Helpers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977941/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Video Streaming for Wireless Networks With Multiple Users and Helpers","volume":"63","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2015","accessionNumber":"14851087","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6977941/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Intel, Cisco, and Verizon Wireless"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Video Streaming for Wireless Networks With Multiple Users and Helpers","sourcePdf":"tcomm-bethanabhotla-2378774-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139312S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7010064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"7010064","articleId":"6977941","onlineDate":"05 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6977942,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In conjunction with feedback reduction schemes, high downlink spectral efficiencies are achieved while limiting the uplink feedback overhead. One such important scheme that has been adopted by these standards is best- m feedback, in which every user feeds back its m largest subchannel (SC) power gains and their corresponding indices. We analyze the single cell average throughput of an OFDM system with uniformly correlated SC gains that employs best- m feedback and discrete rate adaptation. Our model incorporates three schedulers that cover a wide range of the throughput versus fairness tradeoff and feedback delay. We show that, for small m, correlation significantly reduces average throughput with best- m feedback. This result is pertinent as even in typical dispersive channels, correlation is high. We observe that the schedulers exhibit varied sensitivities to correlation and feedback delay. The analysis also leads to insightful expressions for the average throughput in the asymptotic regime of a large number of users.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2378279","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7081396/06977942.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2378279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7081396","startPage":"1983","endPage":"1993","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of OFDM Systems With Best- - Feedback, Scheduling, and Delays for Uniformly Correlated Subchannels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977942","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of OFDM Systems With Best- <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"TeX\">$m$</tex-math></inline-formula> Feedback, Scheduling, and Delays for Uniformly Correlated Subchannels","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977942/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15039124","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6977942/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Nokia Solutions and Networks"},{"fundingName":"National Conference on Communications"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of OFDM Systems With Best- <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"TeX\">$m$</tex-math></inline-formula> Feedback, Scheduling, and Delays for Uniformly Correlated Subchannels","sourcePdf":"twc-ananya-2378279-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129222S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7081396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7081396","articleId":"6977942","onlineDate":"05 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6977946,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

Works reported in literature use support metric-based sensor association rules which employ the occurrence frequency of patterns as criteria. However, consideration of the binary frequency of a pattern is not a sufficient indicator for finding meaningful patterns because it only reflects the number of epochs which contain that pattern in the dataset. The share measure of sensorsets could discover useful knowledge about trigger values associated with a sensor. Here, we propose a new type of behavioral pattern called share-frequent sensor patterns (SFSPs) by considering the non-binary frequency values of sensors in epochs. SFSPs can find a correlation among a set of sensors and hence can improve the performance of WSNs in a resource management process. In this paper, a share-frequent sensor pattern tree (ShrFSP-tree) has been proposed to facilitate a pattern growth mining technique to discover SFSPs from WSN data. We also present a parallel and distributed method where the ShrFSP-tree is enhanced into PShrFSP-tree and its performance is investigated for both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. Results show that our method is time and memory efficient in finding SFSPs than the existing most efficient algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2014.2377713","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/7323921/06977946.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2014.2377713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7323921","startPage":"3471","endPage":"3484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Share-Frequent Sensor Patterns Mining from Wireless Sensor Network Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977946","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Share-Frequent Sensor Patterns Mining from Wireless Sensor Network Data","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977946/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"26","issue":"12","publicationDate":"1 Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15587643","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6977946/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Share-Frequent Sensor Patterns Mining from Wireless Sensor Network Data","sourcePdf":"tpds-rashid-2377713-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133078S","chronDate":"Dec. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"7323921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7323921","articleId":"6977946","onlineDate":"05 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6977947,"authors":[{"name":"Rania Morsi","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7081396/6977947/morsi-2378261-small.gif","p":["\nRania Morsi (S'07) received the B.Sc. degree (with highest honors) from \nthe German University in Cairo (GUC), Cairo, Egypt, in 2009 and the M.Sc. degree from Ulm University, Ulm, Germany, in \n2010.

In this paper, we study downlink multiuser scheduling for a time-slotted system with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer. In particular, in each time slot, a single user is scheduled to receive information, whereas the remaining users opportunistically harvest the ambient RF energy. We devise novel online scheduling schemes in which the tradeoff between the users' ergodic rates and their average amount of harvested energy can be controlled. In particular, we modify the well-known maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and maximum normalized-SNR (N-SNR) schedulers by scheduling the user whose SNR/N-SNR has a certain ascending order (selection order) rather than the maximum one. We refer to these new schemes as order-based SNR/N-SNR scheduling and show that the lower the selection order, the higher the average amount of harvested energy in the system at the expense of a reduced ergodic sum rate. The order-based N-SNR scheduling scheme provides proportional fairness among the users in terms of both the ergodic achievable rate and the average harvested energy. Furthermore, we propose an order-based equal throughput (ET) fair scheduler, which schedules the user having the minimum moving average throughput out of the users whose N-SNR orders fall into a given set of allowed orders. We show that this scheme provides the users with proportionally fair average harvested energy values. In this context, we also derive feasibility conditions for achieving ET with the order-based ET scheduler. Using the theory of order statistics, the average per-user harvested energy and ergodic achievable rate of all proposed scheduling schemes are analyzed and obtained in closed form for independent and nonidentically distributed Rayleigh, Rician, Nakagami- $m$, and Weibull fading channels. Our closed-form analytical results are corroborated by simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2378261","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7081396/06977947.pdf","startPage":"1967","endPage":"1982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2378261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7081396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser Scheduling Schemes for Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer Over Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977947","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977947/","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser Scheduling Schemes for Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer Over Fading Channels","volume":"14","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15039150","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6977947/","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser Scheduling Schemes for Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer Over Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"twc-morsi-2378261-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09336S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7081396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"7081396","articleId":"6977947","onlineDate":"05 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6977954,"authors":[{"name":"Muxuan Liang","affiliation":["Department of Statistics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI","Department of Mathematical Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, P.

The recent development of high-throughput sequencing technologies has enabled the rapid collection of multi-platform genomic data (e.g., gene expression, miRNA expression, and DNA methylation) for the same set of tumor samples. Although numerous integrative clustering approaches have been developed to analyze cancer data, few of them are particularly designed to exploit both deep intrinsic statistical properties of each input modality and complex cross-modality correlations among multi-platform input data. In this paper, we propose a new machine learning model, called multimodal deep belief network (DBN), to cluster cancer patients from multi-platform observation data. In our integrative clustering framework, relationships among inherent features of each single modality are first encoded into multiple layers of hidden variables, and then a joint latent model is employed to fuse common features derived from multiple input modalities. A practical learning algorithm, called contrastive divergence (CD), is applied to infer the parameters of our multimodal DBN model in an unsupervised manner. Tests on two available cancer datasets show that our integrative data analysis approach can effectively extract a unified representation of latent features to capture both intra- and cross-modality correlations, and identify meaningful disease subtypes from multi-platform cancer data. In addition, our approach can identify key genes and miRNAs that may play distinct roles in the pathogenesis of different cancer subtypes. Among those key miRNAs, we found that the expression level of miR-29a is highly correlated with survival time in ovarian cancer patients. These results indicate that our multimodal DBN based data analysis approach may have practical applications in cancer pathogenesis studies and provide useful guidelines for personalized cancer therapy.","doi":"10.1109/TCBB.2014.2377729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7180481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCBB.2014.2377729","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8857/7180481/06977954.pdf","startPage":"928","endPage":"937","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrative Data Analysis of Multi-Platform Cancer Data with a Multimodal Deep Learning Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Integrative Data Analysis of Multi-Platform Cancer Data with a Multimodal Deep Learning Approach","volume":"12","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug. 1 2015","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6977954/","publicationDate":"1 July-Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15381573","pubMedId":"26357333","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977954/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2011CBA00300 and 2011CBA00301"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61033001, 61361136003 and 61472205"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrative Data Analysis of Multi-Platform Cancer Data with a Multimodal Deep Learning Approach","sourcePdf":"tcbb-zeng-2377729-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104972S","chronDate":"July-Aug. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"8857","isNumber":"7180481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8857","citationCount":"129","xplore-issue":"7180481","articleId":"6977954","onlineDate":"05 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6977956,"authors":[{"name":"Carlo Condo","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/7240148/6977956/condo-small.gif","p":["Carlo Condo received the MSc degree in electrical and computer\n engineering from Politecnico di Torino, Italy, and the University of Illinois at Chicago in 2010.

In this scenario, Unequal error protection (UEP) techniques have been proposed in the past to encode stored information, allowing to detect and possibly recover from errors during load operations, while offering different levels of protection to partitions of codewords according to their importance. Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are used in many communication standards to encode the transmitted information: at reception, LDPC decoders heavily rely on memories to store and correct the received information. To ensure efficient and reliable decoding of information, the need to protect the memories used in LDPC decoders is of primary importance. In this paper we present a study on how to efficiently design UEP techniques for LDPC decoder memories. The devised UEP method is divided in four adjustable levels, each one offering a different degree of protection. The full UEP, along with simplified versions, has been implemented within an existing decoder and its area occupation and power consumption evaluated. Comparison with the literature on the subject shows an unmatched level of protection from errors at a small complexity and energy cost.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2014.2378271","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7240148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2014.2378271","endPage":"2993","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7240148/06977956.pdf","startPage":"2981","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unequal Error Protection of Memories in LDPC Decoders","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977956/","displayDocTitle":"Unequal Error Protection of Memories in LDPC Decoders","volume":"64","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"15432823","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6977956/","publicationDate":"1 Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unequal Error Protection of Memories in LDPC Decoders","sourcePdf":"tc-montuschi-2378271-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103712S","chronDate":"Oct. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7240148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7240148","articleId":"6977956","onlineDate":"05 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6977960,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Feng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of Ministry of Education of China, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7001732/6977960/feng-2367022-small.gif","p":["\n\nJie Feng received the B.S. degree from Chang'an University, Xi'an, \nChina, in 2008.

However, these spectral bands have much redundancy and bring an extra computational burden. Thus, band selection is important for hyperspectral images. Since the labeled samples are difficult to obtain, a semi-supervised criterion based on maximum discrimination and information (MDI) is defined by using both limited labeled samples and sufficient unlabeled samples. This MDI criterion aims to select the most highly discriminative and informative bands, but it is hard to accurately calculate. Therefore, a novel criterion based on high discrimination, high information, and low redundancy (DIR) is proposed as its low-order approximation. Moreover, from an information theory perspective, a theoretical proof is given that many traditional semi-supervised feature selection criteria are the low-order approximations of this MDI criterion. Compared with them, the proposed criterion needs more relaxed approximation conditions. To search and optimize the proposed criterion, a novel clonal selection algorithm is proposed, where the adaptive clone and mutation operators are devised to speed up the convergence. Experimental results on hyperspectral images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed semi-supervised band selection method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mutual-Information-Based Semi-Supervised Hyperspectral Band Selection With High Discrimination, High Information, and Low Redundancy","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2014.2367022","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7001732/06977960.pdf","startPage":"2956","endPage":"2969","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2014.2367022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7001732","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977960","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977960/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","displayDocTitle":"Mutual-Information-Based Semi-Supervised Hyperspectral Band Selection With High Discrimination, High Information, and Low Redundancy","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"53","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6977960/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"14847918","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program (973 Program) of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329402"},{"fundingName":"Program for Cheung Kong Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University","grantNumber":"IRT1170"},{"fundingName":"Fund for Foreign Scholars in University Research and Teaching Programs (the 111 Project)","grantNumber":"B07048"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61173090, 61272282 and 61403304"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"JB140317"},{"fundingName":"National Research Foundation for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China","grantNumber":"20110203110006"},{"fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"NCET-13-0948"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mutual-Information-Based Semi-Supervised Hyperspectral Band Selection With High Discrimination, High Information, and Low Redundancy","sourcePdf":"tgrs-feng-2367022-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14327S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7001732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"7001732","articleId":"6977960","onlineDate":"05 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6977969,"authors":[{"name":"Dajiang Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7302619/6977969/liu-2371854-small.gif","p":["Dajiang Liu received the B.S. degree from the School of Microelectronics and Solid-State Electronics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2009.

Loops in applications are often mapped onto CGRAs for acceleration, and the mapping of loops onto CGRA is quite a challenging work due to the parallel execution paradigm and constrained hardware resource. To map loops onto CGRAs efficiently, it is important to transform loops into pieces that obey hardware resource constraints with less overhead (e.g., communication and configuration overhead). In this paper, we tackle this problem by establishing a performance optimization problem, including loop transformation and back- end placing and routing. A novel searching strategy is also designed to find the optimal result efficiently. Finally, we built a complete flow of mapping loop nests onto CGRA. Experiment results on most kernels of the Polybench show that our proposed approach can improve the performance of the kernels by 42% on average, as compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The runtime complexity of our approach is also acceptable.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2371854","startPage":"2581","endPage":"2594","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7302619/06977969.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2371854","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7302619","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing Spatial Mapping of Nested Loop for Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architectures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Arrays","Context","Vectors","Power demand","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nested loop spatial mapping","coarse-grained reconfigurable architectures","CGRA","parallel execution paradigm","constrained hardware resource","hardware resource constraints","performance optimization problem","loop transformation","back-end placing","back-end routing","loop nest mapping","Polybench","runtime complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Affine transformation","coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture (CGRA)","loop nests","polyhedral model."]},{"kwd":["Affine transformation","coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture (CGRA)","loop nests","polyhedral model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977969/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing Spatial Mapping of Nested Loop for Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architectures","volume":"23","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6977969/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15553525","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"China Major Science and Technology (S&T) Project","grantNumber":"2013ZX01033001-001-003"},{"fundingName":"National High Technologies Research Program, China","grantNumber":"2012AA012701 and 2012AA010904"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61274131"},{"fundingName":"International S&T Cooperation Project","grantNumber":"2012DFA11170"},{"fundingName":"Tsinghua Indigenous Research Project","grantNumber":"20111080997"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing Spatial Mapping of Nested Loop for Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architectures","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-liu-2371854-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114798S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7302619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7302619","articleId":"6977969","onlineDate":"05 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6977971,"authors":[{"name":"Yutian Lei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7112252/6977971/lei-small.gif","p":["Yutian Lei (S\u201911) received the B.A. and M.Eng. degrees in\n electrical and information science from the University of Cambridge, Cambridge, U.K., in 2012.

Soft-charging operation can be employed to eliminate the current transients and greatly improve the power density of SC converters. In this approach, a second-stage magnetic converter is cascaded with the SC stage to act as a controlled current load. Another approach is to use resonant SC converters with zero-current switching. This paper shows that resonant and soft-charging operations of SC converters are closely related, and a technique will be proposed, which achieves either operation by adding a single inductor to existing SC topologies. In addition, since most preexisting resonant or soft-charging SC converters were devised in an ad-hoc manner, this paper formulates an analytical method that can determine whether an existing conventional SC converter topology is compatible with the proposed approach. A number of common SC topologies are analyzed, including Dickson, series-parallel, ladder, Fibonacci, and doubler configurations. Through comparison to simulated results, as well as experimental work, the proposed method is validated and a family of high-performance SC converters is obtained.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2014.2377738","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7112252/06977971.pdf","startPage":"5650","endPage":"5664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7112252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2014.2377738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A General Method for Analyzing Resonant and Soft-Charging Operation of Switched-Capacitor Converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977971","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"A General Method for Analyzing Resonant and Soft-Charging Operation of Switched-Capacitor Converters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977971/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"22 May 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15144597","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6977971/","volume":"30","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A General Method for Analyzing Resonant and Soft-Charging Operation of Switched-Capacitor Converters","sourcePdf":"tpel-pilawapodgurski-2377738-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095038S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7112252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"7112252","articleId":"6977971","onlineDate":"05 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6977983,"authors":[{"name":"Mahdi Nikdast","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"p":["Mahdi Nikdast (S\u201910\u2013M\u201914) received the Ph.D. degree in electronic and computer engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, in 2013.","He is currently a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the Department of Computer and Software Engineering, Polytechnique Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.

However, the basic optical devices employed to construct WDM-based ONoCs are imperfect and suffer from inevitable power loss and crosstalk noise. Furthermore, when employing WDM, optical signals of various wavelengths can interfere with each other through different optical switching elements within the network, creating crosstalk noise. As a result, the crosstalk noise in large-scale WDM-based ONoCs accumulates and causes severe performance degradation, restricts the network scalability, and considerably attenuates the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we systematically study and compare the worst case as well as the average crosstalk noise and SNR in three well-known optical interconnect architectures, mesh-based, folded-torus-based, and fat-tree-based ONoCs using WDM. The analytical models for the worst case and the average crosstalk noise and SNR in the different architectures are presented. Furthermore, the proposed analytical models are integrated into a newly developed crosstalk noise and loss analysis platform (CLAP) to analyze the crosstalk noise and SNR in WDM-based ONoCs of any network size using an arbitrary optical router. Utilizing CLAP, we compare the worst case as well as the average crosstalk noise and SNR in different WDM-based ONoC architectures. Furthermore, we indicate how the SNR changes in respect to variations in the number of optical wavelengths in use, the free-spectral range, and the microresonators Q factor. The analyses' results demonstrate that the crosstalk noise is of critical concern to WDM-based ONoCs: in the worst case, the crosstalk noise power exceeds the signal power in all three WDM-based ONoC architectures, even when the number of processor cores is small, e.g., 64.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7302619/06977983.pdf","startPage":"2552","endPage":"2565","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2370892","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2370892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7302619","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crosstalk Noise in WDM-Based Optical Networks-on-Chip: A Formal Study and Comparison","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical crosstalk","Optical noise","Crosstalk","Optical waveguides","Signal to noise ratio","Optical modulation","Optical losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crosstalk","network-on-chip","optical interconnections","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WDM-based optical networks-on-chip","wavelength-division multiplexing technology","multiprocessor systems-on-chip","optical switching elements","optical interconnect architectures","fat-tree-based ONoC","folded-torus-based ONoC","mesh-based ONoC","crosstalk noise and loss analysis platform","CLAP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical crosstalk noise","optical interconnects","optical losses","signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)","wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM)."]},{"kwd":["Optical crosstalk noise","optical interconnects","optical losses","signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)","wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977983/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Crosstalk Noise in WDM-Based Optical Networks-on-Chip: A Formal Study and Comparison","volume":"23","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6977983/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15553530","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Huawei Technologies Company, Ltd"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crosstalk Noise in WDM-Based Optical Networks-on-Chip: A Formal Study and Comparison","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-nikdast-2370892-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087113S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7302619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"7302619","articleId":"6977983","onlineDate":"05 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6977991,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos M.

Since these units are usually required to ramp up during the peak and backup intermittent renewable generation and contingencies, the power system tends to demand more flexibility and reliability from the gas system. This paper contributes with a novel mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation that couples power and gas networks taking into account the gas traveling velocity and compressibility. As a result, the model accounts for the gas adequacy needed to assure the power system reliability in the short term. The robustness of the MILP formulation allows guaranteeing global optimality within predefined tolerances.

In particular, synchronized phasor measurements have found many applications in this context. This paper presents a linear weighted least-squares (WLS) method for fault location estimation of transmission lines by synchronized voltage measurements. The measurements may be taken from the faulted line terminals or buses far from the faulted line. The circuit equations of the network are used to find the transfer function between the fault location and each voltage measurement. Next, two auxiliary variables are defined to transform the nonlinear fault location estimation problem into a linear WLS problem. A closed-form solution is then obtained for fault location. The use of multiple measurements provides the opportunity of identifying erroneous measurements by a statistical test. The linearity of the problem expedites both estimation and identification procedures. Moreover, the method requires neither to classify the fault type nor to estimate the fault resistance. Furthermore, transmission lines are modeled by distributed parameters so that the method can be applicable to long lines. Electromagnetic transient simulations for 9-bus and 22-bus test systems reveal accurate fault location estimation, regardless of fault type and resistance, as well as successful identification of measurement errors.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2014.2322977","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/7042857/06977997.pdf","startPage":"874","endPage":"884","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2014.2322977","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7042857","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Method for Fault Location of Transmission Lines by Wide-Area Voltage Measurements Considering Measurement Errors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977997","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977997/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Method for Fault Location of Transmission Lines by Wide-Area Voltage Measurements Considering Measurement Errors","volume":"6","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"14945557","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6977997/","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Method for Fault Location of Transmission Lines by Wide-Area Voltage Measurements Considering Measurement Errors","sourcePdf":"tsg-dobakhshari-2322977-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111492S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"7042857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7042857","articleId":"6977997","onlineDate":"05 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6977998,"authors":[{"name":"Marius Neag","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunication and Information Technology, Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, CJ, Romania"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7047256/6977998/6977998-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marius Neag received the Electronic Engineer Diploma from the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Romania, in 1991 and was awarded the Ph.D. degree by the University of Limerick, Ireland, in 1999.

These analyses are performed on a fairly general case: a generic reciprocal two-port network that closes a feedback loop around an op-amp acting as the forward amplifier. The four main types of op-amps were considered. The limitations of some of the tested methods are then highlighted by simulations. Besides the detailed analysis of previously reported methods, the paper proposes a novel method for deriving the return ratio of feedback circuits, that employs only current stimuli; it is demonstrated analytically that this method can be used for bilateral circuits, not only for op-amp-based (unilateral) ones. Also, a recent method for deriving directly the phase margin of a circuit is extended to estimating the gain margin, too. Conclusions on the accuracy and suitability of the analyzed methods for practical circuit cases are drawn. These results are then extended to other circuit topologies.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2014.2370151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2014.2370151","startPage":"625","endPage":"634","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7047256/06977998.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7047256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative Analysis of Simulation-Based Methods for Deriving the Phase- and Gain-Margins of Feedback Circuits With Op-Amps","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","displayDocTitle":"Comparative Analysis of Simulation-Based Methods for Deriving the Phase- and Gain-Margins of Feedback Circuits With Op-Amps","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 February 2015","volume":"62","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6977998/","accessionNumber":"14964360","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6977998/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative Analysis of Simulation-Based Methods for Deriving the Phase- and Gain-Margins of Feedback Circuits With Op-Amps","sourcePdf":"tcsi-ciprian-2370151-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075147S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7047256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7047256","articleId":"6977998","onlineDate":"05 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6978001,"authors":[{"name":"Jiafu Lin","affiliation":["VIRTUS, School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jiafu","lastName":"Lin","id":"38239256900"},{"name":"Chirn Chye Boon","affiliation":["VIRTUS, School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chirn Chye","lastName":"Boon","id":"37408579300"},{"name":"Xiang Yi","affiliation":["VIRTUS, School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Yi","id":"37897267500"},{"name":"Guangyin Feng","affiliation":["VIRTUS, School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Singapore"],"firstName":"Guangyin","lastName":"Feng","id":"37085356833"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"6978001","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1372},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Injection-locked oscillators","Power generation","Bandwidth","CMOS integrated circuits","Power amplifiers","Logic gates","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","injection locked amplifiers","millimetre wave amplifiers","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS technology","injection-locked power amplifier","ILPA","millimeter-wave frequency","loading effect","narrow injection locking bandwidth","injection locking range","load-to-tank pulling","power added efficiency","PAE","complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor","frequency 50 GHz to 59 GHz","size 65 nm","efficiency 16.1 percent"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS power amplifier (PA)","injection locking","low power","power added efficiency (PAE)","V-band"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6978001","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2014.2369960","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2014.2369960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7001729","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7260/7001729/06978001.pdf","startPage":"52","endPage":"54","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 50\u201359 GHz CMOS Injection Locking Power Amplifier","abstract":"The injection-locked power amplifier (ILPA) has demonstrated relatively high gain and high efficiency at millimeter-wave frequency.

Traditional classifiers cannot sort out this problem because they focus on the data in the majority class than on the data in the minority class, and then they predict some upcoming data as the data in the majority class. Under-sampling is an efficient way to handle this problem because this method selects the representatives of the data in the majority class. For this reason, under-sampling occupies shorter training period than over-sampling. The only problem with the under-sampling method is that a representative selection, in all probability, throws away important information in a majority class. To overcome this problem, we propose a cluster-based under-sampling method. We use a clustering algorithm that is performance guaranteed, named k-centers algorithm, which clusters the data in the majority class and selects a number of representative data in many proportions, and then combines them with all the data in the minority class as a training set. In this paper, we compare our approach with k-means on five datasets from UCI with two classifiers: 5-nearest neighbors and c4.5 decision tree. The performance is measured by Precision, Recall, F-measure, and Accuracy. The experimental results show that our approach has higher measurements than the k-means approach, except Precision where both the approaches have the same rate.","doi":"10.1109/ICSEC.2014.6978197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSEC.2014.6978197","startPage":"215","endPage":"221","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Computer Science and Engineering Conference (ICSEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6949052/6978115/06978197.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 International Computer Science and Engineering Conference (ICSEC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6978115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Under-sampling by algorithm with performance guaranteed for class-imbalance problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July 30 2014-Aug. 1 2014","displayDocTitle":"Under-sampling by algorithm with performance guaranteed for class-imbalance problem","conferenceDate":"30 July-1 Aug. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6978197/","accessionNumber":"14794443","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6978197/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Under-sampling by algorithm with performance guaranteed for class-imbalance problem","confLoc":"Khon Kaen, Thailand","sourcePdf":"1569975371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036758S","chronDate":"July 30 2014-Aug. 1 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6949052","isNumber":"6978115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6949052","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6978115","articleId":"6978197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6978199,"authors":[{"name":"Mojeeb Al-Rhman Al-Khiaty","affiliation":["Information and Computer Science Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mojeeb Al-Rhman","lastName":"Al-Khiaty","id":"37085398464"},{"name":"Moataz Ahmed","affiliation":["Information and Computer Science Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Moataz","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"38201019100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4963-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-4965-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6978199","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unified modeling language","Measurement","Accuracy","Computational modeling","Semantics","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["greedy algorithms","simulated annealing","software engineering","Unified Modeling Language"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software development","UML class diagrams","greedy algorithm","model management operations","similarity assessment metrics","matching algorithms","simulated annealing algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["model matching","similarity metrics","greedy matching algorithm","reuse"]}],"abstract":"During the early stages of software development, engineers find themselves dealing with a large collection of models.

To help the businesses, the model of opinion mining is proposed for classifying the reviews and to analyze the attitude of customers for improving their products and services. In this research, the artificial neural network is applied to classify the positive and negative reviews. In addition, the mRMR feature selection is used to select the features of data in order to reduce the number of features in the data set.

The GA converges quickly toward a solution neighborhood, but it takes a considerable amount of time to converge to the Pareto set. The SCM can find the global solution because it sweeps the whole space of interest. However, the computational effort grows exponentially with the dimension of the design space. In the hybrid algorithm, the GA is used initially to find a rough solution for the multi-objective optimization problem (MOP). Then, the SCM method takes over to find the non-dominated solutions in each region returned by the GA. It should be pointed out that one point near or on the Pareto set is enough for the SCM to recover the rest of the solution in the region. For comparison purpose, the hybrid algorithm, the GA and SCM methods are applied to solve some of benchmark problems with the Hausdorff distance, number of function evaluations and CPU time as performance metrics. The results show that the hybrid algorithm outperforms other methods with a modest computational time increase. Although the hybrid algorithm does not guarantee finding the global solution, it has much improved chance as demonstrated by one of the benchmark problems.","doi":"10.1109/ICEEE.2014.6978246","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2014 11th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control (CCE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEE.2014.6978246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6978245","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 11th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control (CCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6961334/6978245/06978246.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A genetic algorithm and cell mapping hybrid method for multi-objective optimization problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6978246/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A genetic algorithm and cell mapping hybrid method for multi-objective optimization problems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6978246/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14794579","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-3 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 3 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A genetic algorithm and cell mapping hybrid method for multi-objective optimization problems","confLoc":"Ciudad del Carmen, Mexico","sourcePdf":"0.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06711S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 3 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6961334","isNumber":"6978245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6961334","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6978245","articleId":"6978246","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6978282,"authors":[{"name":"Rafael Aguilar-Gonzalez","affiliation":["Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de San Luis Potos\u00ed (UASLP), San Luis Potosi, SLP, Mexico"],"firstName":"Rafael","lastName":"Aguilar-Gonzalez","id":"37085367722"},{"name":"Marco Cardenas-Juarez","affiliation":["Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de San Luis Potos\u00ed (UASLP), San Luis Potosi, SLP, Mexico"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Cardenas-Juarez","id":"38270918300"},{"name":"Ulises Pineda-Rico","affiliation":["Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de San Luis Potos\u00ed (UASLP), San Luis Potosi, SLP, Mexico"],"firstName":"Ulises","lastName":"Pineda-Rico","id":"38277735600"},{"name":"Enrique Stevens-Navarro","affiliation":["Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de San Luis Potos\u00ed (UASLP), San Luis Potosi, SLP, Mexico"],"firstName":"Enrique","lastName":"Stevens-Navarro","id":"38273073800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6230-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6228-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6978282","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":223},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface acoustic waves","Bandwidth","Economics","Frequency shift keying","Indexes","Cognitive radio","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","decision making"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MADM occupancy algorithm","spectrum decision","cognitive radio networks","cognitive radio terminal","underutilized spectrum","secondary users","CRN","multiple attribute decision making problem","simple additive weighting algorithm","SAW algorithm","technique-for-order preference-by-similarity-to-ideal solution algorithm","TOPSIS algorithm","compromise ranking method","VIKOR","real spectrum occupancy measurements","spectrum attributes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6978282","doi":"10.1109/ICEEE.2014.6978282","publicationTitle":"2014 11th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control (CCE)","abstract":"Spectrum decision is an important functionality of a cognitive radio terminal, which allows the selection of the appropriate frequency band from the available underutilized spectrum. Spectrum decision conducts itself in accordance to the communication requirements of the secondary (or cognitive) users in the forthcoming Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs). Selecting the best spectrum for a given transmission involves making preference decisions over the set of available alternatives of frequency bands, which are indeed characterized by different attributes. Therefore, spectrum decision can be modeled as a multiple attribute decision making (MADM) problem. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of MADM decision algorithms such as Simple Additive Weighting (SAW), Technique for Order Preferences by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and the Compromise Ranking Method VIKOR for spectrum decision. The study, however, is conducted using real spectrum occupancy measurements to evaluate the performance of the aforementioned algorithms in a practical scenario. Some important attributes of underutilized spectrum are proposed for consideration in the decisions. Results show that SAW algorithm performs well for the preferred spectrum attributes in the selected scenarios, while offering a good performance also in other parameters.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEE.2014.6978282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6978245","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 11th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control (CCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6961334/6978245/06978282.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of MADM algorithms with real spectrum measurements for spectrum decision in cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6978282/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 3 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6978282/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of MADM algorithms with real spectrum measurements for spectrum decision in cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-3 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14794578","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of MADM algorithms with real spectrum measurements for spectrum decision in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Ciudad del Carmen, Mexico","sourcePdf":"46.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096455S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 3 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6961334","isNumber":"6978245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6961334","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6978245","articleId":"6978282","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6978298,"authors":[{"name":"O.

To support this function, it is necessary to achieve sufficient accuracy on the forecasting of energy resources and market prices. The deregulated market price prediction presents challenges since the occurrence and magnitude of the price spikes are difficult to estimate. This paper proposes a hybrid method for very-short term market price forecasting to improve prediction accuracy on both nonspike and spike wholesale market prices. First, Support Vector Classification is carried out to predict spike price occurrence and Support Vector Regression is used to forecast magnitude for both non-spike and spike market prices. Additionally, three clustering techniques including Classification and Regression Trees, K-means, and Stratification methods are introduced to mitigate high error spike magnitude estimation. The performance of the proposed hybrid method is validated with the ERCOT wholesale market price. The results from proposed method show significant improvement over typical approaches.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2014.6978374","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Industry Application Society Annual Meeting","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2014.6978374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6978335","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971852/6978335/06978374.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Industry Application Society Annual Meeting","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forecasting","Charging stations","Support vector machines","Predictive models","Accuracy","Load modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicles","forecasting theory","power engineering computing","power markets","pricing","regression analysis","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid market price forecasting method","data clustering techniques","EV charging station","charging service","electric vehicle charging station","energy resources forecasting","market prices","deregulated market price prediction","price spikes","very-short term market price forecasting","spike wholesale market prices","support vector classification","support vector regression","spike market prices","clustering techniques","regression trees","stratification methods","K-mean methods","ERCOT wholesale market price"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["EV Charging infrastructure","deregulated market","market price forecasting","support vector machine","data clustering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Novel hybrid market price forecasting method with data clustering techniques for EV charging station application","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6978374/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6978374/","accessionNumber":"14809370","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","conferenceDate":"5-9 Oct. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Oct. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel hybrid market price forecasting method with data clustering techniques for EV charging station application","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"2014ESC0246.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075015S","chronDate":"5-9 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971852","isNumber":"6978335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971852","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6978335","articleId":"6978374","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6978382,"authors":[{"name":"Spyridon V.

However, the actual vessel's operating profile at reduced M/E power and speed does not justify the use of full capacities. In this paper, a data-driven process control topology is proposed to adjust the speed of E/R ventilation fan motors according to the variation of combustion air flow requirements in order to optimize energy efficiency during ship's sea-going and cargo operation periods. The controller dynamics are established through parameter monitoring, regardless of the model of the controlled plant. For the tanker vessel under investigation, a case study initially defines the plant operational constraints and its power saving potential. The proposed variable frequency process control topology is then applied as a retrofit installation to the existing 18.5kW E/R fan motor starters.

However, high-power applications require low device switching frequencies to reduce the dominating switching losses and thus improve the overall efficiency of drive system. On the other hand, total harmonic distortion (THD) of current waveforms increases at low device switching frequencies. Therefore, the challenge is to maintain the quality of current waveforms while operating MLCs at low device switching frequencies. The main goal of our study was to provide brief review of the various low-switching frequency modulation techniques proposed for MLCs in MV high-power applications and then, discuss in detail about one of the emerging control technique known as synchronous optimal pulsewidth modulation (SOP). The experimental results from seven and nine-level inverters fed induction motor drive demonstrated the effectiveness of SOP technique. Also, some of the future trends in the applications of MLCs are discussed to encourage further research into development of low-switching frequency modulation techniques.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2014.6978399","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Industry Application Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971852/6978335/06978399.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6978335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2014.6978399","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Industry Application Society Annual Meeting","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A survey of low-switching frequency modulation techniques for medium-voltage multilevel converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6978399","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A survey of low-switching frequency modulation techniques for medium-voltage multilevel converters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6978399/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6978399/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14795220","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","conferenceDate":"5-9 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A survey of low-switching frequency modulation techniques for medium-voltage multilevel converters","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"2014IACC0455.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.134291S","chronDate":"5-9 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971852","isNumber":"6978335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971852","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6978335","articleId":"6978399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6978413,"authors":[{"name":"Giusi Quartarone","affiliation":["University of Pavia, Pavia"],"firstName":"Giusi","lastName":"Quartarone","id":"38233976600"},{"name":"Norma Anglani","affiliation":["University of Pavia, Pavia"],"firstName":"Norma","lastName":"Anglani","id":"37397178600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2288-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-2618"}],"articleNumber":"6978413","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Linear programming","Databases","Minimization","Mixed integer linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressors","integer programming","linear programming","power system management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mixed integer linear programming","air compressor rooms","energy efficiency","flow profile","energy consumption","energy savings"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)","Topology optimization","Compressed air system","Energy efficiency","Compressor control rules"]}],"abstract":"In this work the application of Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) techniques is proposed for choosing the optimal topology of an air compressor room, while (i) focusing on energy efficiency and (ii) keeping the input power to the lowest value. Usually the proposal of the best configuration (type of machines, size and number) is driven by the experience of the personnel performing the assessment, according to his own knowledge of the available products/machines on the market. The paper proposes the formulation of two optimization problems which enable (i) to perform the best configuration of a compressor room, according with an available machines database; (ii) to ensure that the best choice implies the minimization of the input power for the compressor room, thus, the minimum consumption for the end-user. The presented formulations are tested using both simulated and real case studies, showing how a higher level of knowledge of the flow profile can help in the reduction of the energy consumption. It will be also demonstrated that important energy savings improvements can be obtained if we compare the choices derived from our methodology with real compressor rooms, whose choice was done without applying such method, as it may happen on the market.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mixed-integer linear programming for the optimal design and management of air compressor rooms","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Industry Application Society Annual Meeting","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2014.6978413","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Industry Application Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971852/6978335/06978413.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2014.6978413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6978335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6978413","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6978413/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Mixed-integer linear programming for the optimal design and management of air compressor rooms","conferenceDate":"5-9 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6978413/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14795208","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mixed-integer linear programming for the optimal design and management of air compressor rooms","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"2014IACC0470.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075996S","chronDate":"5-9 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971852","isNumber":"6978335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971852","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6978335","articleId":"6978413","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6978424,"authors":[{"name":"Rafael A.

The various aspects covered include its protection schemes as well as operation and control. This is intended to provide a voltage of high power quality and reliability at the sensitive load terminals, and also improve the energy efficiency of all the mining equipment. In the proposed MVDC microgrid, several local distributed energy resources (DERs) have been employed including PV arrays, wind turbines, a fuel cell stack, an energy storage system and mobile diesel generators. A comprehensive analysis is presented on the protection, operation and control of the MVDC microgrid system. A communication based differential protection scheme with solid state electronic relays is employed for isolating only the faulted portion of the MVDC microgrid. Previous research work had largely neglected the backup protection for DC systems. In this paper, the overcurrent protection device is utilized for backup protection. Furthermore, with an appropriate communication and cooperative framework among these DERs accompanied by dc bus signaling (DBS) control, the dc bus voltage can be maintained within an acceptable range. MATLAB/Simulink modeling and simulation results are presented and discussed to illustrate the system's reliability, security and power quality.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6978335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2014.6978508","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Industry Application Society Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Industry Application Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971852/6978335/06978508.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2014.6978508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An MVDC microgrid for a remote area mine site: Protection, operation and control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"An MVDC microgrid for a remote area mine site: Protection, operation and control","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6978508/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14795258","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6978508/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An MVDC microgrid for a remote area mine site: Protection, operation and control","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"2014PSPC0486.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.141764S","chronDate":"5-9 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971852","isNumber":"6978335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971852","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6978335","articleId":"6978508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6978522,"authors":[{"name":"Nabil El-Hinnawy","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA","Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems, Linthicum, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Nabil","lastName":"El-Hinnawy","id":"38336496900"},{"name":"Pavel Borodulin","affiliation":["Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Pavel","lastName":"Borodulin","id":"38305459200"},{"name":"Evan B.

The measured gain, saturated output power, and PAE of the power- DAC cell are 14.9 dB, 13.2 dBm, and 2.8%, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/CSICS.2014.6978539","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuit Symposium (CSICS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuit Symposium (CSICS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971855/6978513/06978539.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSICS.2014.6978539","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6978513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An 8-Bit 140-GHz Power-DAC Cell for IQ Transmitter Arrays with Antenna Segmentation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6978539","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6978539/","displayDocTitle":"An 8-Bit 140-GHz Power-DAC Cell for IQ Transmitter Arrays with Antenna Segmentation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14820921","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6978539/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An 8-Bit 140-GHz Power-DAC Cell for IQ Transmitter Arrays with Antenna Segmentation","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"pid1156054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033137S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971855","isNumber":"6978513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971855","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6978513","articleId":"6978539","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6978544,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Merkle","affiliation":["Institute for Applied Solid State Physics (IAP), Freiburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Merkle","id":"38348577700"},{"name":"Arnulf Leuther","affiliation":["Institute for Applied Solid State Physics (IAP), Freiburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Arnulf","lastName":"Leuther","id":"37085342264"},{"name":"Stefan Koch","affiliation":["Institute for Applied Solid State Physics (IAP), Freiburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Koch","id":"37289212000"},{"name":"Ingmar Kallfass","affiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Institute of Robust Power Semiconductor Systems, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Ingmar","lastName":"Kallfass","id":"37267397800"},{"name":"Axel Tessmann","affiliation":["Fraunhofer-Institut fur Angewandte Festkorperphysik, Freiburg, Baden-W\u00c3\u00bcrttemberg, DE"],"firstName":"Axel","lastName":"Tessmann","id":"37282675300"},{"name":"Sandrine Wagner","affiliation":["Institute for Applied Solid State Physics (IAP), Freiburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Sandrine","lastName":"Wagner","id":"37958866300"},{"name":"Hermann Massler","affiliation":["Institute for Applied Solid State Physics (IAP), Freiburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Hermann","lastName":"Massler","id":"37085393823"},{"name":"Michael Schlechtweg","affiliation":["Institute for Applied Solid State Physics (IAP), Freiburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Schlechtweg","id":"37085355247"},{"name":"Oliver Ambacher","affiliation":["Institute for Applied Solid State Physics (IAP), Freiburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Ambacher","id":"37085361832"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3622-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-8781"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8443"}],"articleNumber":"6978544","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":352},"abstract":"High gain amplifier MMICs (monolithic microwave integrated circuits) addressing broadband radar and communication applications at the waveguide bands WR-6 (110 - 170 GHz) and WR-3 (220 - 325 GHz) are presented. All circuits are manufactured in the next generation metamorphic high electron mobility transistor (mHEMT) technology featuring 20 nm gate length and a strained 100% InAs channel. The transistors are encapsulated by 0.3 \u03bcm and 1.4 \u03bcm thick layers of benzocyclobutene (BCB). The 1.4 \u03bcm thick BCB layer is used to form shielded thin-film microstrip (TFMS) lines confined at the front-side of the wafer for implementing matching networks. Substrate thinning and backside processing is not required for the function of the amplifiers. The amplifier for WR-6 operates over the whole waveguide band with an average gain of 28 dB. A gain of more than 24 dB was measured for the MMIC from 215 - 290 GHz. All presented MMICs exceed 30% of gain defined bandwidth.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuit Symposium (CSICS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971855/6978513/06978544.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuit Symposium (CSICS)","doi":"10.1109/CSICS.2014.6978544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSICS.2014.6978544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6978513","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6978544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Backside Process Free Broadband Amplifier MMICs at D-Band and H-Band in 20 nm mHEMT Technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","MMICs","mHEMTs","Transmission line measurements","Coplanar waveguides","Indium phosphide","Microstrip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high electron mobility transistors","microstrip lines","MMIC amplifiers","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backside process free broadband amplifier MMIC","D band","H band","mHEMT technology","high gain amplifier MMIC","monolithic microwave integrated circuits","broadband radar applications","broadband communication applications","next generation metamorphic high electron mobility transistor technology","shielded thin film microstrip lines","matching networks","substrate thinning","backside processing","size 20 nm","frequency 110 GHz to 170 GHz","frequency 220 GHz to 325 GHz","size 0.3 mum","size 1.4 mum","gain 28 dB","frequency 215 GHz to 290 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6978544/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Backside Process Free Broadband Amplifier MMICs at D-Band and H-Band in 20 nm mHEMT Technology","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6978544/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14820954","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Backside Process Free Broadband Amplifier MMICs at D-Band and H-Band in 20 nm mHEMT Technology","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"pid1156136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063394S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971855","isNumber":"6978513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971855","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6978513","articleId":"6978544","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6978546,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Shopov","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Shopov","id":"37945761300"},{"name":"Sorin P.

However, they have limited resources for computation, memory, networking, and battery. An effective approach to remedying the constraints is to offload resource-intensive components of a mobile app to a resource-abundant server and run it, called offloading and more generally Mobile Cloud Computing. There are a number of different approaches to offloading, and they result in different gains on benefit. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy of offloading schemes and an assessment on the schemes. We first propose five criteria for classifying offloading schemes and define a taxonomy using the criteria. And, we choose a subset of practically configurable offloading schemes out of 32 schemes in the table. Then, we characterize the resulting offloading schemes by using key quality gains with offloading, Time Efficiency, Resource Consumption, and Adaptability to Load Evolution. Using the proposed taxonomy and guidelines, we present a case study of designing an off loadable mobile app and assess the applicability of the proposed taxonomy and guidelines.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Taxonomy of Offloading in Mobile Cloud Computing","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 7th International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing and Applications","doi":"10.1109/SOCA.2014.22","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 7th International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975728/6978154/06978603.pdf","startPage":"147","endPage":"153","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCA.2014.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6978154","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6978603","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6978603/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Taxonomy of Offloading in Mobile Cloud Computing","conferenceDate":"17-19 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6978603/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14795393","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Taxonomy of Offloading in Mobile Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Matsue, Japan","sourcePdf":"6833a147.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075206S","chronDate":"17-19 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6975728","isNumber":"6978154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6975728","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6978154","articleId":"6978603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6978614,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi-Kai Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Zhi-Kai","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085575224"},{"name":"Michael Cheng Yi Cho","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, TW"],"firstName":"Michael Cheng Yi","lastName":"Cho"},{"name":"Chia-Wei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085576760"},{"name":"Chia-Wei Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Wei","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37072327300"},{"name":"Chong-Kuan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chong-Kuan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085567299"},{"name":"Shiuhpyng Shieh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shiuhpyng","lastName":"Shieh","id":"37265521700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6833-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-2871"}],"articleNumber":"6978614","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":255,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":20634},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Malware","Software","Cryptography","Internet of Things","Androids","Humanoid robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data privacy","Internet","Internet of Things","invasive software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IoT security","Internet-of-things","wearable devices","home appliances","Internet","information security preservation","authenticity","malware"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Internet of Things","information security","naming","identification","authenticity","malware"]}],"abstract":"The Internet of Things (IoT) opens opportunities for wearable devices, home appliances, and software to share and communicate information on the Internet.

We investigate the problem for large sensor networks for both independent and dependent Gaussian measurement noises in the presence of temporally separable as well as inseparable constraints, e.g., energy constraints. First, when the measurement noises are uncorrelated between sensors, we derive the optimal solution for sensor selection when the constraints are temporally separable. When constraints are temporally inseparable, we can obtain near-optimal solutions by relaxing the nonconvex problem formulation to a linear programming problem so that the sensor selection problem for a large sensor network can be solved in a computationally efficient manner. For illustration, a radar target tracking problem is considered where it is shown that the new method presented for nonlinear dynamic systems performs better than the method based on linearizing the nonlinear equations and using previous sensor selection methods for large sensor networks. Finally, when the measurement noises are correlated between the sensors, the sensor selection problem with temporally inseparable constraints can be relaxed to a Boolean quadratic programming problem,,which can be efficiently solved by a Gaussian randomization procedure along with solving a semidefinite programming problem. Numerical examples show that the proposed method that includes consideration of dependence performs much better than the method that ignores dependence of noises.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensor selection for nonlinear systems in large sensor networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2014.130455","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/6978827/06978870.pdf","startPage":"2664","endPage":"2678","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2014.130455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6978827","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6978870","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6978870/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2014","displayDocTitle":"Sensor selection for nonlinear systems in large sensor networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"50","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6978870/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","publicationDate":"October 2014","accessionNumber":"14818069","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensor selection for nonlinear systems in large sensor networks","sourcePdf":"2664.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115657S","chronDate":"October  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"6978827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6978827","articleId":"6978870","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6978873,"authors":[{"name":"Sithamparanathan Kandeepan","affiliation":["RMIT University Melbourne, RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/6978827/6978873/6978873-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sithamparanathan Kandeepan (SMIEEE, 2009) received his Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at the University of Technology, Sydney, Australia (2003), and is currently with the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia.

The energy-efficient operation of such networks is important given that the entire network infrastructure, including the battery-operated ground terminals, exhibits requirements to operate under power-constrained situations. In this paper, we discuss the design and evaluation of an adaptive cooperative scheme intended to extend the survivability of the battery-operated aerial-terrestrial communication links. We propose and evaluate a real-time adaptive cooperative transmission strategy for dynamic selection between direct and cooperative links based on the channel conditions for improved energy efficiency. We show that the cooperation between mobile terrestrial terminals on the ground could improve energy efficiency in the uplink, depending on the temporal behavior of the terrestrial and aerial uplink channels. The corresponding delay in having cooperative (relay-based) communications with relay selection is also addressed. The simulation analysis corroborates that the adaptive transmission technique improves overall energy efficiency of the network whilst maintaining low latency, enabling real-time applications.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2014.130012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6978827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2014.130012","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/6978827/06978873.pdf","startPage":"2715","endPage":"2735","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aerial-terrestrial communications: terrestrial cooperation and energy-efficient transmissions to aerial base stations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Aerial-terrestrial communications: terrestrial cooperation and energy-efficient transmissions to aerial base stations","volume":"50","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2014","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6978873/","publicationDate":"October 2014","accessionNumber":"14810835","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6978873/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aerial-terrestrial communications: terrestrial cooperation and energy-efficient transmissions to aerial base stations","sourcePdf":"2715.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147946S","chronDate":"October  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"6978827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"6978827","articleId":"6978873","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6978876,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Mahdi Naghsh","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/6978827/6978876/6978876-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohammad Mahdi Naghsh (S'09) received B.

Therefore a so-called multiple frequency shift keying (MFSK) transmit signal was developed, which is applied to measure target range and radial velocity separately and simultaneously. In this case the radar measurement is based on a frequency and additionally on a phase measurement, which suffers from a lower estimation accuracy compared with a pure frequency measurement. This MFSK waveform can therefore be improved and outperformed by a chirp sequences waveform.

Frequency diverse array (FDA) provides a range-dependent beamforming, but it cannot estimate directly both the range and angle of a target. This paper proposes a subarray-based FDA radar, with an aim to localize the target in the range-angle domain.We divide the whole FDA array into two subarrays, which employ two different frequency increments. In doing so, the target's range and angle are estimated directly from the transmit-receive beamforming output peak. The estimation performance is examined by analyzing the minimum mean variance square error (MMSE) and the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) versus signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The corresponding transmit-receive beampattern and signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) are also formalized. Moreover, the CRLB can be used to optimally design the frequency increments. The effectiveness is verified by simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2014.120804","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/6978827/06978897.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2014.120804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6978827","startPage":"3057","endPage":"3067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subarray-based frequency diverse array radar for target range-angle estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6978897","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Subarray-based frequency diverse array radar for target range-angle estimation","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6978897/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"50","issue":"4","publicationDate":"October 2014","accessionNumber":"14810867","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6978897/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subarray-based frequency diverse array radar for target range-angle estimation","sourcePdf":"3057.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085465S","chronDate":"October  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"6978827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"6978827","articleId":"6978897","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6978900,"authors":[{"name":"Zongyu Zuo","affiliation":["Seventh Research Division, Science and Technology on Aircraft Control Laboratory, Beijing, P.

Code concatenation is widely used in all kinds of communication to boost the error correction capabilities of single codes; serial concatenation of turbo and LDPC codes has been recently proven effective enough for deep space communications, being able to overcome the shortcomings of both code types. This work extends the performance analysis of this scheme and proposes a novel hardware decoder architecture for concatenated turbo and LDPC codes based on the same decoding algorithm.

The active PMS verifies its own feasibility as it successfully keeps the power sources within their proper operational bounds and maintains a target state-of-charge of 45%, while responding to the various conditions associated with the power required. In addition, through a comparison of flight test results with a power simulation of the passive method, the usefulness, advantages, and disadvantages of an active power management method over a passive method are investigated.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2014.130468","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/6978827/06978906.pdf","startPage":"3167","endPage":"3177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2014.130468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6978827","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active power management system for an unmanned aerial vehicle powered by solar cells, a fuel cell, and batteries","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Active power management system for an unmanned aerial vehicle powered by solar cells, a fuel cell, and batteries","volume":"50","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14810871","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"October 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6978906/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6978906/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active power management system for an unmanned aerial vehicle powered by solar cells, a fuel cell, and batteries","sourcePdf":"3167.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062864S","chronDate":"October  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"6978827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"6978827","articleId":"6978906","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6978908,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Liu","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/6978827/6978908/6978908-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhen Liu was born in Jiangsu, China, in 1983.

Considering its inherent randomness, this paper focuses on sidelobe reduction in inverse synthetic aperture radar imaging for sparse target scenes based on the compressed sensing (CS) theory. First, precise motion compensation and a high-resolution range profile (HRRP) with a low sidelobe are simultaneously achieved by the CS scheme for each train containing fewer pulses. Then, we analyze the disadvantages of conventional cross-range compression algorithms, which cannot guarantee high-quality focusing performance because there may be some false HRRPs caused by the uncertainty of the CS theory or some other factors. Finally, the modified correlation coefficient is defined to discard a large percentage of those uncorrelated HRRPs and the cross-range resolution is achieved by using the CS theory again. The validity of this decoupled imaging algorithm is demonstrated by some simulation and experimental results, which indicate that the approach is capable of precise estimation of scattering centers and effective suppression of a high sidelobe.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2014.110645","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/6978827/06978908.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2014.110645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6978827","startPage":"3195","endPage":"3211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoupled ISAR imaging using RSFW based on twice compressed sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6978908","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Decoupled ISAR imaging using RSFW based on twice compressed sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6978908/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"50","issue":"4","publicationDate":"October 2014","accessionNumber":"14810830","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6978908/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoupled ISAR imaging using RSFW based on twice compressed sensing","sourcePdf":"3195.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110108S","chronDate":"October  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"6978827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6978827","articleId":"6978908","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6979009,"authors":[{"name":"Dorit Aharonov","affiliation":["Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel"],"firstName":"Dorit","lastName":"Aharonov","id":"37281572800"},{"name":"Aram W.

Such interactive coding schemes simulate any n-round interactive protocol using N rounds over an adversarial channel that corrupts up to \u03c1N transmissions. Important performance measures for a coding scheme are its maximum tolerable error rate \u03c1, communication complexity N, and computational complexity. We give the first coding scheme for the standard setting which performs optimally in all three measures: Our randomized non-adaptive coding scheme has a near-linear computational complexity and tolerates any error rate \u03b4 <; 1/4 with a linear N = \u0398(n) communication complexity. This improves over prior results [1]-[4] which each performed well in two of these measures. We also give results for other settings of interest, namely, the first computationally and communication efficient schemes that tolerate \u03c1 <; 2/7 adaptively, \u03c1 <; 1/3 if only one party is required to decode, and \u03c1 <; 1/2 if list decoding is allowed. These are the optimal tolerable error rates for the respective settings. These coding schemes also have near linear computational and communication complexity. These results are obtained via two techniques: We give a general black-box reduction which reduces unique decoding, in various settings, to list decoding. We also show how to boost the computational and communication efficiency of any list decoder to become near linear\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n.","doi":"10.1109/FOCS.2014.49","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FOCS.2014.49","startPage":"394","endPage":"403","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 55th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975722/6978973/06979024.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 55th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6978973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Error Rates for Interactive Coding II: Efficiency and List Decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Error Rates for Interactive Coding II: Efficiency and List Decoding","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6979024/","accessionNumber":"14819562","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979024/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Error Rates for Interactive Coding II: Efficiency and List Decoding","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"6517a394.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064902S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6975722","isNumber":"6978973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6975722","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6978973","articleId":"6979024","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":6979027,"authors":[{"name":"Yin Tat Lee","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, MIT, Cambridge, USA"],"firstName":"Yin Tat","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085532787"},{"name":"Aaron Sidford","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, MIT, Cambridge, USA"],"firstName":"Aaron","lastName":"Sidford","id":"37085529307"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6517-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0272-5428"}],"articleNumber":"6979027","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1159},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear systems","Standards","Linear programming","Convergence","Approximation methods","Polynomials","Laplace equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","directed graphs","linear programming","linear systems","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["path-finding methods","constraint matrix","bit complexity","linear systems","linear time computation","polynomial time","linear program formulation","dense directed unit capacity graphs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["linear program","maximum flow","interior point"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a new algorithm for '/ solving linear programs that requires only \u00d5(\u221arank(A)L) iterations where A is the constraint matrix of a linear program with m constraints, n variables, and bit complexity L.

Our lower bounds apply even to very simple, smooth function families, such as linear and quadratic functions. This implies that algorithms from previous work can be used to obtain optimal error rates, under the additional assumption that the contributions of each data point to the loss function is smooth.

Certain cases of quantum rewinding are handled by the results by Watrous (SIAM J Comput, 2009) and Unruh (Eurocrypt 2012), yet in general the problem remains elusive. We show that this is not only due to a lack of proof techniques: relative to an oracle, we show that classically secure proofs and proofs of knowledge are insecure in the quantum setting. More specifically, sigma-protocols, the Fiat-Shamir construction, and Fischlin's proof system are quantum insecure under assumptions that are sufficient for classical security. Additionally, we show that for similar reasons, computationally binding commitments provide almost no security guarantees in a quantum setting. To show these results, we develop the \"pick-one trick\", a general technique that allows an adversary to find one value satisfying a given predicate, but not two.","doi":"10.1109/FOCS.2014.57","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 55th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 55th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975722/6978973/06979032.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FOCS.2014.57","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6978973","startPage":"474","endPage":"483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantum Attacks on Classical Proof Systems: The Hardness of Quantum Rewinding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6979032","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Quantum Attacks on Classical Proof Systems: The Hardness of Quantum Rewinding","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979032/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14819558","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6979032/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum Attacks on Classical Proof Systems: The Hardness of Quantum Rewinding","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"6517a474.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093441S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6975722","isNumber":"6978973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6975722","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6978973","articleId":"6979032","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6979036,"authors":[{"name":"Piotr Indyk","affiliation":["MIT"],"firstName":"Piotr","lastName":"Indyk","id":"37370561100"},{"name":"Michael Kapralov","affiliation":["MIT"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Kapralov","id":"37085353110"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6517-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0272-5428"}],"articleNumber":"6979036","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":217},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6979036","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Complexity theory","Approximation methods","Discrete Fourier transforms","Compressed sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","computational complexity","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sample-optimal Fourier sampling","\u21132/\u21132 sparse recovery","Fourier measurements","empirical sampling complexity","complexity","sample optimal algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sparse Fourier Transform","sample complexity","compressed sensing","sparse recovery"]}],"abstract":"We give an algorithm for \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n/\u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n sparse recovery from Fourier measurements using O(k log N) samples, matching the lower bound of Do Ba-Indyk-Price-Woodruff'10 for non-adaptive algorithms up to constant factors for any k \u2264 N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1-\u03b4</sup>\n.

Theoretical guarantees for alternating minimization have been hard to come by and are still poorly understood. This is in part because the heuristic is iterative and non-convex in nature. We give a new algorithm based on alternating minimization that provably recovers an unknown low-rank matrix from a random subsample of its entries under a standard incoherence assumption. Our results reduce the sample size requirements of the alternating minimization approach by at least a quartic factor in the rank and the condition number of the unknown matrix. These improvements apply even if the matrix is only close to low-rank in the Frobenius norm. Our algorithm runs in nearly linear time in the dimension of the matrix and, in a broad range of parameters, gives the strongest sample bounds among all subquadratic time algorithms that we are aware of. Underlying our work is a new robust convergence analysis of the well-known Power Method for computing the dominant singular vectors of a matrix. This viewpoint leads to a conceptually simple understanding of alternating minimization. In addition, we contribute a new technique for controlling the coherence of intermediate solutions arising in iterative algorithms based on a smoothed analysis of the QR factorization. These techniques may be of interest beyond their application here.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979050/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14819572","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6979050/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Understanding Alternating Minimization for Matrix Completion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding Alternating Minimization for Matrix Completion","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"6517a651.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071117S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6975722","isNumber":"6978973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6975722","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"6978973","articleId":"6979050","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6979068,"authors":[{"name":"Yun-Chao Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yun-Chao","lastName":"Yu","id":"37070271700"},{"name":"Chi-Chun Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Chun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085489824"},{"name":"Jin-Fu Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jin-Fu","lastName":"Li","id":"37085430363"},{"name":"Chih-Yen Lo","affiliation":["Information and Communication Research Lab., Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Yen","lastName":"Lo","id":"37061542800"},{"name":"Chao-Hsun Chen","affiliation":["Information and Communication Research Lab., Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chao-Hsun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085495442"},{"name":"Jenn-Shiang Lai","affiliation":["Information and Communication Research Lab., Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jenn-Shiang","lastName":"Lai","id":"37085498970"},{"name":"Ding-Ming Kwai","affiliation":["Information and Communication Research Lab., Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ding-Ming","lastName":"Kwai","id":"37085493155"},{"name":"Yung-Fa Chou","affiliation":["Information and Communication Research Lab., Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yung-Fa","lastName":"Chou","id":"37085497813"},{"name":"Cheng-Wen Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Wen","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085392191"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6030-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1081-7735"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5386"}],"articleNumber":"6979068","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6979068","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Tuning","Three-dimensional displays","Built-in self-test","Through-silicon vias","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self test","circuit tuning","driver circuits","logic design","programmable circuits","random-access storage","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic die","write operations","TSV load","logic-DRAM stack","driver tuning","test flow","test patterns","BIST design","stacked 3D DRAM dies","programmable drivers","driving capability","built-in self-test","memory wall","through-silicon via","three-dimensional dynamic random access memory","TSV-based 3D DRAM","IO-channel power","BIST-assisted tuning scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D IC","DRAM","BIST","low power","through silicon via","at-speed test"]}],"abstract":"Three-dimensional dynamic random access memory (3D DRAM) using through-silicon via (TSV) has been acknowledged as one good approach for overcoming the memory wall.

Effective testing methods are required to ensure robust DMFB operation and high confidence in the outcome of biochemical experiments. Prior work on DMFB testing does not address the problem of designing the test to minimize reliability degradation during test application. It also ignores physical constraints arising from fluidic behavior and the physics of electro wetting-on-dielectric. We develop a practical and realistic testing method by first systematically analyzing the influence of actuation voltage and actuation frequency on the distribution of the electric field, and its resulting effect on dielectric degradation. Next, we use this analysis to choose appropriate parameter settings for testing, and proposes a new pipelined scan-like testing method. Both static and dynamic fluidic constraints are considered in the new testing method, and a diagnosis technique is presented to easily locate defects. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed testing approach in minimizing test-completion time.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability-Driven Pipelined Scan-Like Testing of Digital Microfluidic Biochips","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 23rd Asian Test Symposium","doi":"10.1109/ATS.2014.22","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 23rd Asian Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975725/6979054/06979077.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"62","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATS.2014.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6979054","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6979077","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Reliability-Driven Pipelined Scan-Like Testing of Digital Microfluidic Biochips","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6979077/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14819746","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability-Driven Pipelined Scan-Like Testing of Digital Microfluidic Biochips","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"6030a057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065086S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6975725","isNumber":"6979054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6975725","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6979054","articleId":"6979077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6979080,"authors":[{"name":"Maciej Trawka","affiliation":["Gda\u0144sk University of Technology, Gdansk, Poland"],"firstName":"Maciej","lastName":"Trawka","id":"37085343952"},{"name":"Grzegorz Mrugalski","affiliation":["Mentor Graphics Corporation, Wilsonville, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Mrugalski","id":"37282711500"},{"name":"Nilanjan Mukherjee","affiliation":["Mentor Graphics Corporation, Wilsonville, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Nilanjan","lastName":"Mukherjee","id":"37326892000"},{"name":"Artur Pogiel","affiliation":["Mentor Graphics Corporation, Wilsonville, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Artur","lastName":"Pogiel","id":"37395560700"},{"name":"Janusz Rajski","affiliation":["Mentor Graphics Corporation, Wilsonville, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Janusz","lastName":"Rajski","id":"37079232500"},{"name":"Jakub Janicki","affiliation":["Pozna\u0144 University of Technology, Pozna\u0144, Poland"],"firstName":"Jakub","lastName":"Janicki","id":"37997521700"},{"name":"Jerzy Tyszer","affiliation":["Pozna\u0144 University of Technology, Pozna\u0144, Poland"],"firstName":"Jerzy","lastName":"Tyszer","id":"37085350731"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6030-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1081-7735"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5386"}],"articleNumber":"6979080","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":238},"abstract":"The paper presents a high-speed serial interface between external tester and Embedded Deterministic Test (EDT) compression logic hosted by SoC designs.

It has been used in DRAM die stacking extensively. However, yield remains a key issue for volume production of 3-D RAMs. In this paper, we present a point-to-point interconnection structure derived from bus and propose a fault tolerance interface scheme for TSVs and micro bumps to enhance their manufacturing yield in the 3-D RAMs. The interconnection structure is inherently redundant and thus can replace defective TSVs or micro bumps without using repair circuits. Global and local reconfiguration approaches are proposed which benefit distinct situations of the 3-D RAM. Analyses show that the proposed intra-channel reconfigurable interconnection scheme can improve the yield of the 3-D RAM effectively. Compared to the previous solution using an inter-channel reconfigurable interconnection scheme, the yield improvement can be as large as 23% which is very significant.","doi":"10.1109/ATS.2014.42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6979054","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATS.2014.42","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 23rd Asian Test Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 23rd Asian Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975725/6979054/06979091.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intra-channel Reconfigurable Interface for TSV and Micro Bump Fault Tolerance in 3-D RAMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Intra-channel Reconfigurable Interface for TSV and Micro Bump Fault Tolerance in 3-D RAMs","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6979091/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14819716","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979091/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intra-channel Reconfigurable Interface for TSV and Micro Bump Fault Tolerance in 3-D RAMs","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"6030a143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056427S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6975725","isNumber":"6979054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6975725","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6979054","articleId":"6979091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6979092,"authors":[{"name":"Jizhe Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California"],"firstName":"Jizhe","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085405134"},{"name":"Sandeep Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California"],"firstName":"Sandeep","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37085426331"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6030-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1081-7735"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5386"}],"articleNumber":"6979092","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":193},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SRAM Array Yield Estimation under Spatially-Correlated Process Variation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6979092","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Correlation","Circuit simulation","Yield estimation","Transistors","SRAM cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatially-correlated process variation","systematic method","parameter variations","two-stage SRAM array yield estimation framework","array level","innovative simulation-reusing scheme"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we propose a systematic method to estimate SRAM array yield considering spatially-correlated process variation. Although many parameter variations have been shown to be spatially-correlated, this phenomenon has been neglected in SRAM yield estimation due to its small impact for small SRAMs. However, its impact on array yield is significant for SRAM arrays of realistic sizes. In this paper we show that three ways in which the spatially-correlated term can be simplified to use existing approaches all lead to high levels of inaccuracy. In particular even the closest yield estimate for 32KB SRAM has more than 20% error. To rectify this we develop a new two-stage SRAM array yield estimation framework that accurately considers spatial correlation. In our approach, first the correlated variation terms are sampled at the array level to remove cell-to-cell dependency. Then we estimate cell yield using our innovative simulation-reusing scheme which dramatically decreases the number of SPICE-like circuit simulations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that can efficiently and accurately estimate SRAM array yield considering spatial correlation.","doi":"10.1109/ATS.2014.43","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATS.2014.43","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 23rd Asian Test Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 23rd Asian Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975725/6979054/06979092.pdf","startPage":"149","endPage":"155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6979054","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979092/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"SRAM Array Yield Estimation under Spatially-Correlated Process Variation","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14819707","htmlLink":"/document/6979092/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SRAM Array Yield Estimation under Spatially-Correlated Process Variation","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"6030a149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110358S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6975725","isNumber":"6979054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6975725","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6979054","articleId":"6979092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6979094,"authors":[{"name":"Shi-Yu Huang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shi-Yu","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085489299"},{"name":"Hua-Xuan Li","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hua-Xuan","lastName":"Li","id":"37085497337"},{"name":"Zeng-Fu Zeng","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Zeng-Fu","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37085490285"},{"name":"Kun-Han Tsai","affiliation":["Mentor Graphics, Silicon Test Solutions"],"firstName":"Kun-Han","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37085486673"},{"name":"Wu-Tung Cheng","affiliation":["Mentor Graphics, Silicon Test Solutions"],"firstName":"Wu-Tung","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37085495850"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6030-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1081-7735"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5386"}],"articleNumber":"6979094","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":190},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Delays","Integrated circuit interconnections","Circuit faults","Inverters","Through-silicon vias","Resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromigration","integrated circuit interconnections","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electro-migration effects","thermal-mechanical effects","TSV","through silicon vias","3D IC","die-to-die interconnects","on-line transition-time monitoring"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["TSV","on-line interconnect monitoring","reliability","timing failure threat","pulse-shrinking"]}],"abstract":"Through Silicon Vias (TSVs) are known to be susceptible to various thermal-mechanical and electro-migration effects that could lead to unexpected resistance increase after certain time of field operation. To cope with this reliability threat, we present an on-line monitoring method that aims to continuously detect excessive transition time occurring to a TSV (which often indicates performance degradation). Our method attaches a monitor to the termination end of a TSV. Any transition there is converted into a pulse-width, which is further compared to a dynamically tunable threshold. A Timing Failure Threat (TFT) is thereby detected when the pulse-width exceeds the threshold. This method can be applied to a large number of TSVs easily since the monitoring results are binary and can be stored in FFs forming a scan chain for easy access.","doi":"10.1109/ATS.2014.39","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 23rd Asian Test Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 23rd Asian Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975725/6979054/06979094.pdf","startPage":"162","endPage":"167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6979054","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATS.2014.39","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-Line Transition-Time Monitoring for Die-to-Die Interconnects in 3D ICs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6979094","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"On-Line Transition-Time Monitoring for Die-to-Die Interconnects in 3D ICs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979094/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14819703","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6979094/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-Line Transition-Time Monitoring for Die-to-Die Interconnects in 3D ICs","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"6030a162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083666S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6975725","isNumber":"6979054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6975725","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6979054","articleId":"6979094","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6979095,"authors":[{"name":"Takahiro J.

SRAM PUFs create unique responses upon power up as certain SRAM cells output a '1' or '0' with high probability due to uncontrollable process variations. A current challenge in SRAM PUFs is their sensitivity to temperature and voltage variations as well as aging. By creating algorithms that isolate stable bits quickly and with minimal testing, the use of SRAM PUF should become more practical. In this paper, we explore the selection of stable bits through enrollment under different conditions (temperature, voltage, and aging) and also by exploiting previously undiscovered interactions between neighboring SRAM cells. We develop metrics that analyze the impact of each neighboring cell and each enrollment condition. Our metrics can be used to identify the best cells and conditions for stable bit selection. We have analyzed data from Spartan 3 FPGA and our metrics identify the best neighborhood size (16 stable neighbors) and best enrollment condition pair (high temperature, high voltage and low temperature).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced Analysis of Cell Stability for Reliable SRAM PUFs","doi":"10.1109/ATS.2014.70","startPage":"348","endPage":"353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATS.2014.70","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6979054","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 23rd Asian Test Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 23rd Asian Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975725/6979054/06979125.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6979125","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Advanced Analysis of Cell Stability for Reliable SRAM PUFs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6979125/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14819712","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced Analysis of Cell Stability for Reliable SRAM PUFs","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"6030a348.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118652S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6975725","isNumber":"6979054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6975725","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6979054","articleId":"6979125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6979193,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Fuchs","affiliation":["IETR, University of Rennes I, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7027885/6979193/6979193-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Benjamin Fuchs (S'06\u2013M'08) received the M.S. and electrical engineering degrees from the National Institute of Applied Science of Rennes, France, in 2004.

They show that it is possible to perfectly retrieve the array excitations from only the knowledge of far-field magnitude by simply solving a convex optimization problem.

The most basic method to preserve connectivity is to have each agent preserve its set of neighbors for all time. More advanced methods preserve a (minimum) spanning tree in the network. Other methods are based on increasing the algebraic graph connectivity, which is given by the second smallest eigenvalue \u03bb\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n(L) of the graph Laplacian \u03bb\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n(L) that represents the network. These methods typically result in a monotonic increase in connectivity until the network is completely connected. In previous work by the authors, a continuous feedback control method had been proposed which allows the connectivity to decrease, that is, edges in the network may be broken. This method requires agents to have knowledge of the entire network. In this paper, we modify the controller to use only local information.

This paper investigates the linear regression outsourcing problem, which is a quite common engineering task and employed in various applications, as a case study to find out the possible problems that need to be solved. We propose two protocols which can enable secure and efficient outsourcing of linear regression problems to the cloud. The protocols can protect the client's data privacy well and at the same time have good efficiency. We show all subtleties and the techniques in designing such protocols. The main idea to protect the privacy is employing some transformations to the original linear regression problem to get a new problem which is sent to the cloud; and then transforming the answer returned back from the cloud to get the true solution to the original problem. Experimental results validate the practical usability of our protocols.","doi":"10.1109/TCC.2014.2378757","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245519/7024233/06979197.pdf","startPage":"499","endPage":"508","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCC.2014.2378757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7024233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Highly Efficient Linear Regression Outsourcing to a Cloud","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6979197","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979197/","displayDocTitle":"Highly Efficient Linear Regression Outsourcing to a Cloud","volume":"2","issue":"4","publicationDate":"1 Oct.-Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14883282","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6979197/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation Project","grantNumber":"cstc2013jcyjA40001"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"CDJZR13185501"},{"fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61170283"},{"fundingName":"National High-Technology Research and Development Program","grantNumber":"2013AA01A212"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004567","fundingName":"Ministry of Education"},{"fundingName":"New Century Excellent Talents Support Program","grantNumber":"NCET-12-0649"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly Efficient Linear Regression Outsourcing to a Cloud","sourcePdf":"tcc-chen-2378757-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088932S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6245519","isNumber":"7024233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245519","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7024233","articleId":"6979197","onlineDate":"08 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":6979202,"authors":[{"name":"Chunhui Zhu","affiliation":["department of Electronic Science, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Chunhui","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37982330500"},{"name":"Qing Huo Liu","affiliation":["department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC"],"firstName":"Qing Huo","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085380451"},{"name":"Lijun Liu","affiliation":["department of Automation, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Lijun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37986101000"},{"name":"Yanhui Liu","affiliation":["department of Electronic Science, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Yanhui","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085449453"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"6979202","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":642},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"Fourier transform of discontinuous functions are often encountered in computational electromagnetics and other areas. In this work, a highly accurate, fast conformal Fourier transform (CFT) algorithm is proposed to evaluate the finite Fourier transform of 3D discontinuous functions. A curved tetrahedron mesh combined with curvilinear coordinate transform, instead of the Cartesian grid, is adopted to flexibly model an arbitrary shape of the discontinuity boundary. This enables us to take full advantages of high order interpolation and Gaussian quadrature methods to achieve highly accurate Fourier integration results with a low sampling density. The 3D nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) helps to keep the complexity of the proposed algorithm to that similar to the traditional 3D FFT algorithm. Therefore, the proposed CFT algorithm can achieve order of magnitude higher accuracy than 3D FFT with lower sampling density and similar computation time. The convergence is proved and verified.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and

We formulate the anomaly detection problem as a binary composite hypothesis testing problem and develop a model-free and a model-based method, leveraging techniques from the theory of large deviations. Both methods first extract a family of probability laws (PLs) that represent normal traffic patterns during different time-periods, and then detect anomalies by assessing deviations of traffic from these laws. We establish the asymptotic Newman-Pearson optimality of both methods and develop an optimization-based approach for selecting the family of PLs from past traffic data. We validate our methods on networks with two representative time-varying traffic patterns and one common anomaly related to data exfiltration. Simulation results show that our methods perform better than their vanilla counterparts, which assume that normal traffic is stationary.","doi":"10.1109/TCNS.2014.2378631","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6509490/7127070/06979214.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCNS.2014.2378631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7127070","startPage":"100","endPage":"111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Traffic Anomaly Detection in Time-Varying Communication Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6979214","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Traffic Anomaly Detection in Time-Varying Communication Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979214/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"2","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15219416","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/6979214/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1239021 and IIS-1237022"},{"fundingName":"ARO","grantNumber":"W911NF-11-1-0227 and W911NF-12-1-0390"},{"fundingName":"ONR","grantNumber":"N00014-10-1-0952"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Traffic Anomaly Detection in Time-Varying Communication Networks","sourcePdf":"tcns-paschalidis-2378631-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1586S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6509490","isNumber":"7127070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6509490","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7127070","articleId":"6979214","onlineDate":"08 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6979215,"authors":[{"name":"Guihong Li","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Antennas and Microwave Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7027885/6979215/6979215-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guihong Li was born in Heilongjiang province, China.

The MIMO array was fabricated and tested, and the results are in good agreement with those of the simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979215/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14914959","htmlLink":"/document/6979215/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"AMC-Loaded Wideband Base Station Antenna for Indoor Access Point in MIMO System","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AMC-Loaded Wideband Base Station Antenna for Indoor Access Point in MIMO System","sourcePdf":"tap-zhai-2378316-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07386S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7027885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"7027885","articleId":"6979215","onlineDate":"08 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6979218,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Driusso","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and Architecture, University of Trieste, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Driusso","id":"37972807100"},{"name":"Massimiliano Comisso","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and Architecture, University of Trieste, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimiliano","lastName":"Comisso","id":"37295755700"},{"name":"Fulvio Babich","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and Architecture, University of Trieste, Italy"],"firstName":"Fulvio","lastName":"Babich","id":"37269562200"},{"name":"Chris Marshall","affiliation":["u-blox UK Ltd, Reigate, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Marshall","id":"37085575470"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"6979218","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":727},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Power distribution","Time of arrival estimation","Bandwidth","Signal to noise ratio","Root mean square","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","radiocommunication","time-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time of arrival estimation","OFDM signals","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","root mean square estimation error","Cramer-Rao bound","Ziv-Zakai bound","OFDM subcarrier distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound","OFDM","root mean square","time of arrival estimation","Ziv-Zakai bound"]}],"abstract":"This letter characterizes the error performance of realistically modelled orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals, when their time of arrival has to be estimated in an additive white Gaussian noise channel. In particular, different power distributions on the available sub-carriers of the OFDM signal are considered, and bounds on the corresponding root mean square estimation error (RMSEE) are evaluated. The tools used for such purpose are the widely adopted Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound and the Ziv-Zakai bound, which is tight in a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values. The presented analysis reveals that, for a given signal bandwidth, a proper power distribution on the OFDM sub-carriers is crucial for achieving a good performance in the low to medium SNR region, where the RMSEE curve exhibits the typical threshold behavior. Moreover, a trade-off between asymptotic and threshold performance is identified, thanks to the adoption of a novel performance figure, which directly describes the threshold RMSEE behavior.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Time of Arrival Estimation on OFDM Signals","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2014.2378994","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/6962924/06979218.pdf","startPage":"983","endPage":"987","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2014.2378994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6962924","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6979218","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979218/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Time of Arrival Estimation on OFDM Signals","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6979218/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"14816734","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Time of Arrival Estimation on OFDM Signals","sourcePdf":"lsp-driusso-2378994-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053834S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6962924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6962924","articleId":"6979218","onlineDate":"08 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6979220,"authors":[{"name":"Shenglong Liao","affiliation":["Information Science and Technology College, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Shenglong","lastName":"Liao","id":"37085371893"},{"name":"Jubai An","affiliation":["Information Science and Technology College, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Jubai","lastName":"An","id":"37587445800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"6979220","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1183},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6979220","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Insulators","Training","Histograms","Visualization","Remote sensing","Object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","insulator testing","object detection","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["insulator detection algorithm","aerial images","target detection","local feature detection","multiscale descriptor","multifeature descriptor","coarse-to-fine matching strategy","background noise elimination"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aerial image","insulator detection","local feature","point matching","spatial orders"]},{"kwd":["Aerial image","insulator detection","local feature","point matching","spatial orders"]}],"abstract":"The detection of targets with complex backgrounds in aerial images is a challenging task.

It is theoretically well known that the codebook size (in bits) for CSI quantization should be increased as the number of transmit antennas becomes larger, and 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) and LTE-Advanced codebooks have sizes that scale according to this rule. It is hard to apply the conventional approach of using unstructured and predefined vector quantization codebooks for CSI quantization in massive MIMO because of the codeword search complexity. In this paper, we propose a trellis-extended codebook (TEC) that can be easily harmonized with current wireless standards, such as LTE or LTE-Advanced, because it can allow standardized codebooks designed for two, four, or eight antennas to be extended to larger arrays by using a trellis structure. TEC exploits a Viterbi decoder for CSI quantization and a convolutional encoder for CSI reconstruction. By quantizing multiple channel entries simultaneously using standardized codebooks in a state transition of a trellis search, TEC can achieve a fractional number of bits per channel entry quantization and a practical feedback overhead. Thus, TEC can solve both the complexity and the feedback overhead issues of CSI quantization in massive MIMO systems. We also develop trellis-extended successive phase adjustment (TE-SPA), which works as a differential codebook for TEC. This is similar to the dual codebook concept of LTE-Advanced. TE-SPA can reduce CSI quantization error with lower feedback overhead in temporally and spatially correlated channels. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in FDD massive MIMO systems.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2378778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7081396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2378778","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7081396/06979230.pdf","startPage":"2007","endPage":"2016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trellis-Extended Codebooks and Successive Phase Adjustment: A Path From LTE-Advanced to FDD Massive MIMO Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Trellis-Extended Codebooks and Successive Phase Adjustment: A Path From LTE-Advanced to FDD Massive MIMO Systems","volume":"14","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6979230/","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15039133","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979230/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Communications Research Team, DMC R&D Center, Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trellis-Extended Codebooks and Successive Phase Adjustment: A Path From LTE-Advanced to FDD Massive MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-choi-2378778-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.16224S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7081396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"7081396","articleId":"6979230","onlineDate":"08 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6979232,"authors":[{"name":"Zengling Ran","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Optical Fiber Sensing and Communications, Ministry of Education, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7106029/6979232/ran-2371243-small.gif","p":["Zengling Ran was born in Chongqing, China, in 1977.

The proposed sensor could offer some excellent features such as good high-temperature stability, low cross-sensitivity between pressure and temperature, ease of mass-production, making it attractive for pressure measurement under high-temperature.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel High-Temperature Fiber-Optic Pressure Sensor Based on Etched PCF F-P Interferometer Micromachined by a 157-nm Laser","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2014.2371243","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7106029/06979232.pdf","startPage":"3955","endPage":"3958","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2014.2371243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7106029","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6979232","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979232/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","displayDocTitle":"Novel High-Temperature Fiber-Optic Pressure Sensor Based on Etched PCF F-P Interferometer Micromachined by a 157-nm Laser","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6979232/","dateOfInsertion":"18 May 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15141656","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51205049"},{"fundingName":"Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University","grantNumber":"IRT1218"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"B14039"},{"fundingName":"Major Equipment Projects through the Ministry of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"M1701010112YQ2500213"},{"fundingName":"Program for New Academic Men Award, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China","grantNumber":"Y03001023601017010"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel High-Temperature Fiber-Optic Pressure Sensor Based on Etched PCF F-P Interferometer Micromachined by a 157-nm Laser","sourcePdf":"jsen-liu-2371243-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052574S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7106029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7106029","articleId":"6979232","onlineDate":"08 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6979236,"authors":[{"name":"Changjiang Deng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Changjiang","lastName":"Deng","id":"38666337700"},{"name":"Yue Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Li","id":"37405713200"},{"name":"Zhijun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhijun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085370427"},{"name":"Zhenghe Feng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenghe","lastName":"Feng","id":"37085350412"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"6979236","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1344},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Slot antennas","Mobile antennas","Mobile handsets","Tuning","Bandwidth","Antenna measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","cellular radio","Long Term Evolution","multifrequency antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-profile hepta-band handset antenna","modes controlling method","GSM850","GSM900","DCS","PCS","UMTS","LTE2300","LTE2500","reflection coefficient","radiation patterns"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Handset antennas","multiple band antennas","modes controlling method"]}],"abstract":"It is a challenging and tough task to achieve and tune multiple frequencies for handset antennas in a small area.

Using the Lloyd-Max method, we also propose a new methodology for the local sensor to quantize its observation. The design of the quantizer embeds the binary NP test outcome in the quantization bits. Using the JCDDF algorithm, we show that coded CSS paired even with a short (8,4) extended Hamming code outperforms not only uncoded CSS, but also schemes where channel decoding and decision fusion are executed separately. Then, we consider the design of good channel codes for such CSS schemes. We demonstrate that the JCDDF algorithm employing unequal error protection (UEP) coding improves performance and outperforms equal error protection coding. Furthermore, we present a simple code search algorithm for identifying short UEP codes. Using such UEP codes, we finally show that a performance improvement over uncoded CSS can be attained also without bandwidth expansion using higher order modulations.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2378789","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7081396/06979241.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7081396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2378789","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"2017","endPage":"2031","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coded Collaborative Spectrum Sensing With Joint Channel Decoding and Decision Fusion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6979241","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Coded Collaborative Spectrum Sensing With Joint Channel Decoding and Decision Fusion","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979241/","volume":"14","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6979241/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15039163","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coded Collaborative Spectrum Sensing With Joint Channel Decoding and Decision Fusion","sourcePdf":"twc-leib-2378789-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7081396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7081396","articleId":"6979241","onlineDate":"08 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6979243,"authors":[{"name":"Yinliang Xu","affiliation":["SYSU-CMU Shunde International Joint Research Institute, Shunde, China","(SYSU-CMU) Joint Institute of Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/7027294/6979243/yinxu-2378691-small.gif","p":["Yinliang Xu (S\u201910\u2013M\u201913) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in control science and engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2007 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, USA, in 2013.","Currently, he is an Assistant Professor with the Sun Yat-sen University-Carnegie Mellon University (SYSU-CMU) Joint Institute of Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, and SYSU-CMU Shunde International Joint Research Institute, Shunde, China.

The proposed control principle, in essence, is to continuously adjust the filter inductance of the active reactor by regulating active power filter (APF) output current in terms of its magnitude and direction. Therefore, the ATHPF using the bidirectional control principle can simultaneously supply different impedances at different selective suppressed harmonic frequencies. The bidirectional control principle can perform both the normal active tuning function and the abnormal active detuning function. To be specific, the normal active tuning function refers to the harmonic elimination with filtering performance independent of the deviation of passive filter parameters, while the latter, the abnormal active detuning function, refers to the flexible protection against harmonic over-current without losing two harmonic elimination and reactive power compensation at the occurrence of harmonic over-current. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the ATHPF with the bidirectional control principle in selective harmonic elimination and flexible protection against harmonic over-current.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2014.2378693","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2014.2378693","startPage":"141","endPage":"154","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/7027294/06979247.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7027294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bidirectional Control Principle of Active Tuned Hybrid Power Filter Based on the Active Reactor Using Active Techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"A Bidirectional Control Principle of Active Tuned Hybrid Power Filter Based on the Active Reactor Using Active Techniques","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","volume":"11","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6979247/","accessionNumber":"14915040","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979247/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Key Discipline Special Foundation of Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"5X1301"},{"fundingName":"Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education","grantNumber":"20126118110009"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bidirectional Control Principle of Active Tuned Hybrid Power Filter Based on the Active Reactor Using Active Techniques","sourcePdf":"tii-deng-2378693-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072393S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"7027294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7027294","articleId":"6979247","onlineDate":"08 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6979248,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanyuan Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of Ministry of Education of China, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7297778/6979248/liu-2374695-small.gif","p":["Yuanyuan Liu received the Ph.D. degree in pattern recognition and intelligent system from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2013.","She is currently a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow with the Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.

The existing trace norm minimization algorithms for iteratively solving LRTC problems involve multiple singular value decompositions of very large matrices at each iteration. Therefore, they suffer from high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a novel trace norm regularized CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition (TNCP) method for simultaneous tensor decomposition and completion. We first formulate a factor matrix rank minimization model by deducing the relation between the rank of each factor matrix and the mode-n rank of a tensor. Then, we introduce a tractable relaxation of our rank function, and then achieve a convex combination problem of much smaller-scale matrix trace norm minimization. Finally, we develop an efficient algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers to solve our problem. The promising experimental results on synthetic and real-world data validate the effectiveness of our TNCP method. Moreover, TNCP is significantly faster than the state-of-the-art methods and scales to larger problems.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2014.2374695","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","startPage":"2437","endPage":"2448","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2014.2374695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7297778","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/7297778/06979248.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tensile stress","Minimization","Matrix decomposition","Manganese","Vectors","Algorithm design and analysis","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","minimisation","singular value decomposition","tensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trace norm regularized CANDECOMP-PARAFAC decomposition","missing data","low-rank tensor completion problems","LRTC problems","trace norm minimization algorithms","multiple singular value decompositions","TNCP method","tensor decomposition","factor matrix rank minimization model","convex combination problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alternating direction method of {multipliers} (ADMM)","CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition","low-rank","tensor completion","trace norm minimization"]},{"kwd":["Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)","CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition","low-rank","tensor completion","trace norm minimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Trace Norm Regularized CANDECOMP/PARAFAC Decomposition With Missing Data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979248/","volume":"45","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6979248/","accessionNumber":"15520748","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"26470059","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program (973 Program) of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329402"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61072106, 61173090 and 61072108"},{"fundingName":"National Research Foundation for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China","grantNumber":"20110203110006"},{"fundingName":"Fund for Foreign Scholars in University Research and Teaching Programs (the 111 Project)","grantNumber":"B07048"},{"fundingName":"Program for Cheung Kong Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University","grantNumber":"IRT1170"},{"fundingName":"SHIAE","grantNumber":"8115048"},{"fundingName":"MSRA","grantNumber":"6903555"},{"fundingName":"GRF","grantNumber":"411211"},{"fundingName":"CUHK Direct","grantNumber":"4055015 and 4055017"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trace Norm Regularized CANDECOMP/PARAFAC Decomposition With Missing Data","sourcePdf":"tcyb-shang-2374695-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126061S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7297778","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"7297778","articleId":"6979248","onlineDate":"08 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6979253,"authors":[{"name":"Jack Greenhalgh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol, Bristol, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/7115254/6979253/green-2363167-small.gif","p":["\nJack Greenhalgh received the M.Eng. degree in computer systems \nengineering from University of Sussex, Brighton, U.K., in 2010.

Maximally stable extremal regions (MSERs) and hue, saturation, and value color thresholding are used to locate a large number of candidates, which are then reduced by applying constraints based on temporal and structural information. A recognition stage interprets the text contained within detected candidate regions. Individual text characters are detected as MSERs and are grouped into lines, before being interpreted using optical character recognition (OCR). Recognition accuracy is vastly improved through the temporal fusion of text results across consecutive frames. The method is comparatively evaluated and achieves an overall $F_{\\rm measure}$ of 0.87.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979253/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6979253/","accessionNumber":"15222343","displayDocTitle":"Recognizing Text-Based Traffic Signs","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"},{"fundingName":"Jaguar Cars Limited"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Recognizing Text-Based Traffic Signs","sourcePdf":"tits-greenhalgh-2363167-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068249S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"7115254","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"7115254","articleId":"6979253","onlineDate":"08 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6979255,"authors":[{"name":"Edoardo Patti","affiliation":["Department of Control and Computer Engineering, Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy"],"firstName":"Edoardo","lastName":"Patti","id":"38233188300"},{"name":"Angeliki Lydia Antonia Syrri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, Manchester, U.K."],"firstName":"Angeliki Lydia Antonia","lastName":"Syrri","id":"37085405431"},{"name":"Marco Jahn","affiliation":["Department of User Centered Computing, Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information Technology FIT, Bonn, Germany"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Jahn","id":"37543034500"},{"name":"Pierluigi Mancarella","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, Manchester, U.K."],"firstName":"Pierluigi","lastName":"Mancarella","id":"37597311500"},{"name":"Andrea Acquaviva","affiliation":["Department of Control and Computer Engineering, Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Acquaviva","id":"37273088400"},{"name":"Enrico Macii","affiliation":["Department of Control and Computer Engineering, Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Macii","id":"37085423332"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1949-3053"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1949-3061"}],"articleNumber":"6979255","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":903},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6979255","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Interoperability","Web services","Peer-to-peer computing","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["middleware","open systems","peer-to-peer computing","power distribution reliability","power engineering computing","power system security","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["general purpose services","smart grid","event-driven middleware","peer-to-peer distributed software infrastructure","event-based middleware","middleware reliability","middleware security","communication technology attacks","hardware-independent interoperability","heterogeneous technology","UK distribution network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aggregation","demand response (DR)","distributed systems","distribution network","middleware","pervasive computing"]},{"kwd":["Aggregation","demand response (DR)","distributed systems","distribution network","middleware","pervasive computing"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the design of an event-driven middleware for general purpose services in smart grid (SG) is presented.

Then, the optimal power allocation and transmission toward the relay and the destination for maximizing the outage probability is analyzed. It is shown that for both fading environments when the jammer power is sufficiently large, jamming the relay and the destination with equal power allocation is optimal, whereas when the jamming power is low, more power should be allocated to jam any of the source-relay and relay-destination links having lower receiving signal power. In addition, the difference between the optimal and the equal power allocation performance is investigated. Analytical results are verified and illustrated by some numerical results and simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2378813","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2378813","startPage":"5020","endPage":"5030","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7323911/06979258.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7323911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Jamming in Dual-Hop Amplify-and-Forward Relaying","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Jamming in Dual-Hop Amplify-and-Forward Relaying","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2015","volume":"64","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6979258/","accessionNumber":"15587061","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979258/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Jamming in Dual-Hop Amplify-and-Forward Relaying","sourcePdf":"tvt-behnad-2378813-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079447S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7323911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7323911","articleId":"6979258","onlineDate":"08 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-06"},{"_id":6979260,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuteru Namba","affiliation":["Graduate School of Advanced Integration Science, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7298/7054614/6979260/namba-2379513-small.gif","p":["\nKazuteru Namba (M'04) received the B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees from \nthe Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan, in 1997, 1999, and 2002, respectively.

The proposed decoder corrects in parallel adjacent and single-symbol errors; moreover, it serially corrects multiple-symbol errors other than adjacent errors. Its operation is based on a novel scheme that extends an existing binary BCH decoder such that a nonbinary RS code can be targeted. The proposed scheme, however, differs from previous schemes in the algorithm and construction of the parallel decoder; the proposed decoder is efficient for multilevel memory systems such as those utilizing phase change memory devices. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme requires a significantly smaller area and lower power than a traditional fully parallelized RS decoder capable of correcting any double-symbol errors in parallel. Furthermore, it is also shown that it requires a smaller area than a parallel error correction scheme using a nonbinary double-error-correcting orthogonal Latin square code.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979260/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","publicationDate":"March 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6979260/","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2015","accessionNumber":"14965354","volume":"15","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Single and Adjacent Symbol Error-Correcting Parallel Decoder for Reed\u2013Solomon Codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Single and Adjacent Symbol Error-Correcting Parallel Decoder for Reed\u2013Solomon Codes","sourcePdf":"tdmr-lombardi-2379513-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072934S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"7054614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7054614","articleId":"6979260","onlineDate":"08 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6979264,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The pulse generator will be used in future work to generate a (sub)-nanosecond streamer plasma for air purification research. The pulse generator is a single-line pulse generator with an oil spark-gap (SG), which generates 0.5-10-ns pulses with a 200-ps rise time and can operate at repetition rates of over 1 kHz into a 50-\u03a9 load. It is an improvement over the first implementation of our nanosecond pulse generator that we designed and verified experimentally in previous work. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of the final design. Furthermore, we present 3-D electromagnetic simulations of the nanosecond pulse generator and show that the simulations are in good agreement with the measurements. A variation in pulse duration from 0.5 to 10 ns is possible and the output pulses are square shaped without the large plateau behind the main pulse that was present in the pulses from the first implementation of the nanosecond pulse generator. At high voltages, the pulse top becomes less flat due to a time-dependent mismatch in the spark-gap. Furthermore, investigation of electrode erosion of the oil spark-gap shows that the erosion rate of the electrodes is in the range of 200-600 \u03bccm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n \u00b7 C\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup>\n for the electrode that is mainly the cathode and 100-300 \u03bccm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n \u00b7C\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup>\n for the electrode that is mainly the anode, respectively.

The wind speed time series (TS) has nonlinear and nonstationary characteristics and not normally distributed, which make it difficult to be predicted by statistical or computational intelligent methods. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and its improved versions are powerful tools to decompose a complex TS into a collection of simpler ones. The improved versions discussed in this paper include ensemble EMD (EEMD), complementary EEMD (CEEMD), and complete EEMD with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN). The EMD and its improved versions are hybridized with two computational intelligence-based predictors: support vector regression (SVR) and artificial neural network (ANN). The EMD-based hybrid forecasting methods are evaluated with 12 wind speed TS. The performances of the hybrid methods are compared and discussed. It shows that EMD and its improved versions enhance the performance of SVR significantly but marginally on ANN, and among the EMD-based hybrid methods, the proposed CEEMDAN-SVR is the best method.

Six techniques, calibrated RRef (CR), flexible RRef (FR), adaptive asymmetric coding (AAC), verify trials reduction (VTR), bits/cell optimization (BCO), and balanced RAID-5/6 are proposed. CR, FR, AAC, and VTR are for ReRAM. CR and FR change the read-reference resistance (RRef) to reduce the BER. AAC first increases the population of Set and then Reset. The BER reduction with FR and AAC is 69 and 78% with 60 and 75% asymmetry, respectively. In VTR, by changing the number of acceptable bit-errors, the total Reset time is reduced by 97% at maximum with small ECC calculation overhead. The reliability of 3-bit/cell MLC NAND flash memory is improved by BCO and balanced RAID-5/6. BCO reallocates 3-bit/cell MLC to 2-bit/cell MLC and single-level cell (SLC) and the write/erase cycle increases by over 22-times. Balanced RAID-5/6 evenly allocates upper/middle/lower pages to a stripe to reduce the RAID failure rate by 98%.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2014.2370171","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7047256/06979273.pdf","startPage":"844","endPage":"853","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2014.2370171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7047256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design Methodology for Highly Reliable, High Performance ReRAM and 3-Bit/Cell MLC NAND Flash Solid-State Storage","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979273/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","displayDocTitle":"Design Methodology for Highly Reliable, High Performance ReRAM and 3-Bit/Cell MLC NAND Flash Solid-State Storage","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/6979273/","accessionNumber":"14964369","volume":"62","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003382","fundingName":"Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Methodology for Highly Reliable, High Performance ReRAM and 3-Bit/Cell MLC NAND Flash Solid-State Storage","sourcePdf":"tcsi-tanakamaru-2370171-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112201S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7047256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7047256","articleId":"6979273","onlineDate":"08 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6979282,"authors":[{"name":"Younghwan Kim","affiliation":["Korea University, School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7000613/6979282/6979282-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Younghwan Kim (S'14) received the B.S. degree in telecommunication engineering from Jeju National University, Korea, in 2011, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 2013, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at Korea University.","His research interest includes millimeter-wave and terahertz-wave integrated circuits for phased-array wireless systems."]},"firstName":"Younghwan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085541314"},{"name":"Sooyeon Kim","affiliation":["Korea University, School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7000613/6979282/6979282-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Sooyeon Kim received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 2007 and 2009, respectively, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at Korea University","From 2009 to 2012, she was a Member of Technical Staff with the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute.

Being one of the two LDACS candidates recommended for further study by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), LDACS1 is a frequency-division duplex (FDD) broadband system exploiting orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Due to signals from coexisting L-band radio systems, LDACS1 has to work under impulsive interference. In this paper, we study the iterative interference mitigation and channel estimation techniques for LDACS1, based on soft-input soft-output (SISO) demodulation and decoding schemes. We use a simple time-domain blanking nonlinearity to mitigate impulsive noise, which introduces inter-carrier interference (ICI) in frequency domain. To improve the performance, iterative decoding (ID) is carried out between a SISO demodulator and a SISO decoder, based on the Turbo principle. By taking into consideration imperfect channel state information (CSI), we design our iterative receiver with two loops, i.e., the inner loop for ID and the outer loop for interference mitigation and CSI estimation. We analyze the performance of the proposed iterative receiver by using bit-error rate (BER) simulations and extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","OFDM","Iterative decoding","Receivers","Channel estimation","Blanking","Demodulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft communication","broadband networks","channel estimation","data communication","demodulation","error statistics","impulse noise","intercarrier interference","iterative decoding","OFDM modulation","radionavigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative interference mitigation","future communications infrastructure","FCI","L-band digital aeronautical communications system","LDACS1","air-to-ground data link technology","International Civil Aviation Organization","ICAO","frequency-division duplex broadband system","FDD broadband system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","L-band radio systems","channel estimation techniques","soft-input soft-output demodulation","SISO demodulation","decoding schemes","time-domain blanking nonlinearity","impulsive noise","intercarrier interference","ICI","frequency domain","iterative decoding","SISO demodulator","SISO decoder","Turbo principle","channel state information","CSI estimation","iterative receiver","bit-error rate","BER simulations","extrinsic information transfer","EXIT charts"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6979393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2014.6979446","startPage":"3B2-1","endPage":"3B2-11","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE/AIAA 33rd Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE/AIAA 33rd Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6950783/6979393/06979446.pdf","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2014.6979446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative interference mitigation and channel estimation for LDACS1","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Iterative interference mitigation and channel estimation for LDACS1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14818577","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6979446/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979446/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative interference mitigation and channel estimation for LDACS1","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"3b2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067208S","chronDate":"5-9 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6950783","isNumber":"6979393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6950783","xplore-issue":"6979393","articleId":"6979446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6979453,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Zhang","affiliation":["Labs of Avionics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, P.

In recent years, the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) safety offices have been researching ways to utilize the many safety databases maintained by the FAA, such as those involving flight recorders, radar tracks, weather, and many other high-volume sensors, in order to monitor this unique and complex system. Although a number of current technologies do monitor the frequency of known safety risks in the NAS, very few methods currently exist that are capable of analyzing large data repositories with the purpose of discovering new and previously unmonitored safety risks. While monitoring the frequency of known events in the NAS enables mitigation of already identified problems, a more proactive approach of finding unidentified issues still needs to be addressed. This is especially important in the proactive identification of new, emergent safety issues that may result from the planned introduction of advanced NextGen air traffic management technologies and procedures. Development of an automated tool that continuously evaluates the NAS to discover both events exhibiting flight characteristics indicative of safety-related concerns as well as operational anomalies will heighten the awareness of such situations in the aviation community and serve to increase the overall safety of the NAS. This paper discusses the extension of previous anomaly detection work to identify operationally significant flights within the highly complex airspace encompassing the New York area of operations, focusing on the major airports of Newark International (EWR), LaGuardia International (LGA), and John F. Kennedy International (JFK). In addition, flight traffic in the vicinity of Denver International (DEN) airport/airspace is also investigated to evaluate the impact on operations due to variances in seasonal weather and airport elevation. From our previous research, subject matter experts determined that some of the identified anomalies were significant, but could not reach conclusive findings without additional supportive data. To advance this research further, causal examination using domain experts is continued along with the integration of air traffic control (ATC) voice data to shed much needed insight into resolving which flight characteristic(s) may be impacting an aircraft's unusual profile. Once a flight characteristic is identified, it could be included in a list of potential safety precursors. This paper also describes a process that has been developed and implemented to automatically identify and produce daily reports on flights of interest from the previous day.","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2014.6979469","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE/AIAA 33rd Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE/AIAA 33rd Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6950783/6979393/06979469.pdf","startPage":"4B3-1","endPage":"4B3-15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2014.6979469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6979393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated discovery of flight track anomalies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6979469","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979469/","displayDocTitle":"Automated discovery of flight track anomalies","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14818536","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6979469/","conferenceDate":"5-9 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated discovery of flight track anomalies","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"4b3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054683S","chronDate":"5-9 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6950783","isNumber":"6979393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6950783","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6979393","articleId":"6979469","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6979495,"authors":[{"name":"David W.

A key concern in all this work is safety, and this has direct implications for the control and non-payload communication (CNPC) systems that must be used to operate UAS in the national airspace. Another key concern is sufficient (and protected) spectrum for UAS, and at present there are two bands in the United States, and potentially internationally: the L-band (960-977 MHz) and C-band (5030-5091 MHz). In any wireless system, the wireless channel can severely impair performance because of dispersion and time variation. Thus in order to design highly reliable CNPC systems, a thorough quantitative knowledge of the air-ground (AG) channel is required. Historically, AG channel research addressed simple cases and short duration, narrowband signals. Yet for UAS that may operate in more complex settings (e.g., low elevation angles, near ground clutter, etc.) and use wider bandwidth CNPC signals, more accurate representations of the AG channel are required. This paper addresses this topic via the quantification of channel characteristics for one of the simplest AG channels: the over-sea setting. We report on measurements conducted as part of a project sponsored by NASA. These measurements in the over-sea environment collected simultaneous wideband channel characteristics (impulse responses) in both L-band and C-band. This was done with a ground based transmitter, and two separate antennas in each band on the aircraft. Thus these measurements allow us to assess both spatial and frequency diversity for both straight and curved flight trajectories. We briefly describe the project and the measurements, and provide a short overview of our recently-published results for propagation path loss, delay spread, and correlations across antennas. We also quantify small-scale fading effects and the diversity attainable across both frequencies and antennas. We conclude with a short description of the statistical models being developed for the various AG channel settings.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna and frequency diversity in the unmanned aircraft systems bands for the over-sea setting","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE/AIAA 33rd Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2014.6979495","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE/AIAA 33rd Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6950783/6979393/06979495.pdf","startPage":"6A4-1","endPage":"6A4-10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2014.6979495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6979393","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6979495","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979495/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Antenna and frequency diversity in the unmanned aircraft systems bands for the over-sea setting","conferenceDate":"5-9 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6979495/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14818569","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna and frequency diversity in the unmanned aircraft systems bands for the over-sea setting","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"6a4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060544S","chronDate":"5-9 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6950783","isNumber":"6979393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6950783","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6979393","articleId":"6979495","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6979499,"authors":[{"name":"Hanlin Zhang","affiliation":["Towson University, Towson, MD"],"firstName":"Hanlin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085378152"},{"name":"Sixiao Wei","affiliation":["Towson University, Towson, MD"],"firstName":"Sixiao","lastName":"Wei","id":"37085387263"},{"name":"Wei Yu","affiliation":["Towson University, Towson, MD"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085388815"},{"name":"Erik Blasch","affiliation":["AFRL/RIEA, Rome, NY"],"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Blasch","id":"37085351801"},{"name":"Genshe Chen","affiliation":["Information Fusion Technology, MD"],"firstName":"Genshe","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085348117"},{"name":"Dan Shen","affiliation":["Information Fusion Technology, MD"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Shen","id":"37291992800"},{"name":"Khanh Pham","affiliation":["AFRl/RV, NM"],"firstName":"Khanh","lastName":"Pham","id":"37085364367"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5001-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5002-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7195"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7209"}],"articleNumber":"6979499","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":697},"abstract":"The recent Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) testing will transform our daily lives.

The optimal exercise strategies were derived and the value of engaging in space communication conflict was quantified.","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2014.6979500","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE/AIAA 33rd Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6950783/6979393/06979500.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6979393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2014.6979500","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE/AIAA 33rd Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)","startPage":"6C2-1","endPage":"6C2-9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network survivability oriented Markov games (NSOMG) in wideband satellite communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6979500","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Network survivability oriented Markov games (NSOMG) in wideband satellite communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979500/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6979500/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14818609","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","conferenceDate":"5-9 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network survivability oriented Markov games (NSOMG) in wideband satellite communications","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"6c2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060262S","chronDate":"5-9 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6950783","isNumber":"6979393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6950783","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6979393","articleId":"6979500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6979699,"authors":[{"name":"Angela Sara Cacciapuoti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technologies (DIETI), University of Naples Federico II, Italy"],"firstName":"Angela Sara","lastName":"Cacciapuoti","id":"37599897900"},{"name":"Marcello Caleffi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technologies (DIETI), University of Naples Federico II, Italy"],"firstName":"Marcello","lastName":"Caleffi","id":"37567814300"},{"name":"Francesco Marino","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technologies (DIETI), University of Naples Federico II, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Marino","id":"37085584508"},{"name":"Luigi Paura","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technologies (DIETI), University of Naples Federico II, Italy"],"firstName":"Luigi","lastName":"Paura","id":"37282080200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5674-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6979699","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Conferences","Aggregates","Routing protocols","Sensors","Cognitive radio","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","numerical analysis","routing protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["route capacity maximization","self-organizing cognitive radio networks","primary-user activity","route selection","PU activity","routing update packets","time interval","routing update period","routing protocol","optimal route priority rule","numerical evaluations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","routing","update"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximizing the route capacity in Cognitive Radio networks","doi":"10.1109/SECONW.2014.6979699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6979690","endPage":"23","publicationTitle":"2014 Eleventh Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking Workshops (SECON Workshops)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Eleventh Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking Workshops (SECON Workshops)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968790/6979690/06979699.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECONW.2014.6979699","startPage":"19","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6979699","abstract":"The problem of choosing the route providing the best communication opportunities among the available routes is particularly challenging in self-organizing Cognitive Radio networks, since the communication opportunities are deeply affected by the primary-user (PU) activity. Furthermore, whenever the route selection exploits proactively acquired information on the PU activity, routing update packets need to be periodically exchanged among the nodes. The time interval between these exchanges, i.e., the routing update period, deeply affects the overall communication opportunities provided by a route, regardless of the adopted routing protocol. Hence, in this paper, we analytically derive the optimal route priority rule in the sense of maximizing the average capacity, by accounting for both the PU activity and the routing update period. The theoretical analysis is conducted by adopting two different widely-adopted PU activity models to confer generality to the analysis. Finally, the analytical results are validated through numerical evaluations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979699/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2014-July 3 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14819343","htmlLink":"/document/6979699/","conferenceDate":"30 June-3 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"Maximizing the route capacity in Cognitive Radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximizing the route capacity in Cognitive Radio networks","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p19cacciapuoti.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091606S","chronDate":"June 30 2014-July 3 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968790","isNumber":"6979690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968790","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6979690","articleId":"6979699","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6979701,"authors":[{"name":"Abdulla Al-Ali","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Abdulla","lastName":"Al-Ali","id":"37085336277"},{"name":"Kaushik Chowdhury","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Kaushik","lastName":"Chowdhury","id":"37317894400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5674-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6979701","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":416},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Protocols","Conferences","Switches","Databases","Throughput","Cities and towns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","discrete event simulation","protocols","radio spectrum management","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full source code","wireless networks","smart environments","dynamic spectrum access","spectrum hand-off","primary user detection","spectrum sensing","ns-3","network simulator 3","CR protocols","CR networks","unlicensed bands","data congestion","cognitive radio technology","alternate spectrum bands","communication infrastructure","spectrum demands"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6979701","doi":"10.1109/SECONW.2014.6979701","publicationTitle":"2014 Eleventh Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking Workshops (SECON Workshops)","abstract":"Sudden spectrum demands may occur in dense and congested cities, which stress the communication infrastructure. At these times, identifying alternate spectrum bands through cognitive radio (CR) technology will allow users to maintain connectivity and relieve data congestion in the unlicensed bands. However, deployment of the CR networks must be preceded by accurate simulation of these networks, given the high infrastructure costs involved in their installation. Moreover, CR protocols are often cross-layered, which cannot be trivially implemented in off-the-shelf hardware. This paper proposes a framework for the network simulator 3 (ns-3) that is suitable for large networks. Our approach introduces several CR capabilities, such as spectrum sensing, primary user detection, and spectrum hand-off. Our simulator demonstrates improvements in execution time and memory usage, when compared to the earlier versions implemented for the ns-2 environment. This paper is accompanied by the release of the full source code for further research and improvement.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECONW.2014.6979701","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6979690","startPage":"28","endPage":"33","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Eleventh Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking Workshops (SECON Workshops)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968790/6979690/06979701.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulating dynamic spectrum access using ns-3 for wireless networks in smart environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979701/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2014-July 3 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6979701/","displayDocTitle":"Simulating dynamic spectrum access using ns-3 for wireless networks in smart environments","conferenceDate":"30 June-3 July 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14819347","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulating dynamic spectrum access using ns-3 for wireless networks in smart environments","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p28alali.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101378S","chronDate":"June 30 2014-July 3 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968790","isNumber":"6979690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968790","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6979690","articleId":"6979701","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6979702,"authors":[{"name":"Marcello Caleffi","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Information Technologies, University of Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Marcello","lastName":"Caleffi","id":"37567814300"},{"name":"Angela Sara Cacciapuoti","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Information Technologies, University of Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Angela Sara","lastName":"Cacciapuoti","id":"37599897900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5674-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6979702","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Databases","White spaces","TV","Availability","Conferences","Sensors","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","Markov processes","probability","smart cities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transition probabilities","closed-form expressions","Markov decision process","communication opportunities","unlicensed users","primary mechanism","smart city paradigm","TV white space wireless networks","TV white space cognitive radio networks","database access strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spectrum Sharing","TV White Space","Cognitive Radio","Database","Strategy"]}],"abstract":"Very recently, city administrations launched TV White Space wireless networks to enable the smart city paradigm. These initiatives leverage the possibility allowed by regulations of unlicensed access to the TV White Space spectrum. All theses rulings rely on a periodic access to a database service as the primary mechanism for the unlicensed users to determine the White Space availability. Nevertheless, the specifics of such a mechanism are yet to be determined. In this paper, we address this issue by designing a database access strategy that allows unlicensed users to: i) respect the requirements imposed by the existing rulings; ii) maximize the expected communication opportunities provided by the TV White Space through the on-demand database accesses. To this aim, we prove the database access problem can be modeled as a Markov Decision Process and we provide the closed-form expressions of the transition probabilities. The analytical results are finally validated through simulations.","doi":"10.1109/SECONW.2014.6979702","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Eleventh Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking Workshops (SECON Workshops)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968790/6979690/06979702.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6979690","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECONW.2014.6979702","publicationTitle":"2014 Eleventh Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking Workshops (SECON Workshops)","startPage":"34","endPage":"38","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Database access strategy for TV White Space cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6979702","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2014-July 3 2014","displayDocTitle":"Database access strategy for TV White Space cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979702/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6979702/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14819342","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","conferenceDate":"30 June-3 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Database access strategy for TV White Space cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p34caleffi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103875S","chronDate":"June 30 2014-July 3 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968790","isNumber":"6979690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968790","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6979690","articleId":"6979702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6979704,"authors":[{"name":"Anshoo Tandon","affiliation":["National University of Singapore"],"firstName":"Anshoo","lastName":"Tandon","id":"37419857800"},{"name":"Mehul Motani","affiliation":["National University of Singapore"],"firstName":"Mehul","lastName":"Motani","id":"37278670800"},{"name":"Lav R.

We provide a lower bound on the achievable rate by deriving a loss term relative to unconstrained random codes.

The downlink and uplink channels between the HAP and users are modeled as fading channels with different spatial correlations. We assume that only statistical channel state information is available at the transmitter. First, we obtain the optimal time slot allocation strategy to maximize the ergodic sum-rate for the no-correlation scenario.

These results indicate that design for hard decoding can provide irregular degree distributions that have good thresholds across the range of possible decoding precisions. These results also quantify the potential benefit of irregular LDPC codes as compared to regular LDPC codes in the flash setting and compare the RCA-EXIT thresholds of word-line voltages optimized for maximum mutual information (MMI) and word-line voltages that explicitly minimize the RCA-EXIT threshold of a specific LDPC degree distribution. Along the way, this paper illustrates that the MMI optimization of word-line voltages for five reads is a quasi-convex problem for the Gaussian model of SLC Flash. The paper also uses RCA-based EXIT analysis to show that for the same spectral efficiency of 0.9 bits per cell, rate-0.45 non-binary LDPC codes on MLC Flash systems provide thresholds more than 0.5 dB better than rate-0.9 binary LDPC codes on SLC Flash with the same number of reads (i.e. three reads that would provide hard decisions for MLC and limited soft information for SLC). The MLC approach has a potential threshold improvement of more than 1.5 dB over the SLC approach when both systems have access to the full soft information.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Symposium on Information Theory and its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968713/6979787/06979792.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2014 International Symposium on Information Theory and its Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6979787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized degree distributions for binary and non-binary LDPC codes in Flash memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimized degree distributions for binary and non-binary LDPC codes in Flash memory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979792/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2014","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14812351","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6979792/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized degree distributions for binary and non-binary LDPC codes in Flash memory","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p6vakilinia.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069183S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968713","isNumber":"6979787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968713","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6979787","articleId":"6979792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6979809,"authors":[{"name":"Tien-Hui Chen","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"lastName":"Tien-Hui Chen","id":"37595136600"},{"name":"Kuan-Chen Chen","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"lastName":"Kuan-Chen Chen","id":"37085505997"},{"name":"Mao-Chao Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Mao-Chao","lastName":"Lin","id":"37366138800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-8855-2292-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6979809","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolutional codes","Parity check codes","Decoding","Polynomials","Delays","Upper bound","Block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","iterative methods","message passing","parity check codes","trellis codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPC convolutional codes","close distance bounds","trellis code","delay processor","signal mapper","short-constraint length","large-constraint length","close upper bound","close lower bound","code structure","low-density parity check convolutional codes","4-cycles free codes","decoding","iterative message-passing algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC Convolutional Codes","LDPC-CCs","Trellis Code","Delay Processor"]}],"abstract":"A trellis code constructed by concatenating a delay processor and a signal mapper to a convolutional code with a short constraint length can be regarded as a convolutional code with a large constraint length.

However, in the construction of EAQEC codes, it is desirable to use as small number of ebits as possible because of the high cost in the preparation of those entangled states. In addition, it is also desired that the error-correcting capability of classical codes from which EAQEC codes are constructed is as high as possible. In order to solve those problems, we consider in this paper a class of EAQEC codes that are based on classical LDPC codes whose parity check matrices are designed by the circulant permutation matrix. Then we give some sufficient conditions on those parity check matrices so that the obtained EAQEC codes need only one ebits. Moreover, we also clarify the condition on which parity check matrices satisfying above sufficient conditions have no 4-cycle, which is one of the important characteristics for the sum-product decoding to exhibit high error-correcting capability.","publicationTitle":"2014 International Symposium on Information Theory and its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Symposium on Information Theory and its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968713/6979787/06979823.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6979787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes based on the circulant permutation matrix","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6979823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979823/","displayDocTitle":"Entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes based on the circulant permutation matrix","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14812364","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6979823/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes based on the circulant permutation matrix","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p158wada.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059861S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968713","isNumber":"6979787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968713","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6979787","articleId":"6979823","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6979825,"authors":[{"name":"Keisuke Kodaira","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Technology Sophia, University Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Keisuke","lastName":"Kodaira","id":"37085468900"},{"name":"Tomoharu Shibuya","affiliation":["Dept. of Information and Communication Sciences, Sophia University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoharu","lastName":"Shibuya","id":"37283009300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-8855-2292-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6979825","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":34},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Binary codes","Error correction codes","Damping","Quantum computing","Australia","Educational institutions","Quantum mechanics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude modulation","error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["classical codes","quantum error correcting codes","amplitude damping channel","quantum channel","quantum states","Shor construction","arbitrary odd prime"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6979825","abstract":"The amplitude damping (AD) quantum channel is one of the models describing evolution of quantum states.

Finally, we compare the performance of the polar codes with that of other codes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979842/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6979842/","accessionNumber":"14819282","displayDocTitle":"Quantum gain of coding by polar codes with finite codeword length","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum gain of coding by polar codes with finite codeword length","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p250iwata.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062127S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968713","isNumber":"6979787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968713","xplore-issue":"6979787","articleId":"6979842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6979857,"authors":[{"name":"Masahito Hayashi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Mathematics, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Masahito","lastName":"Hayashi","id":"37533252800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-8855-2292-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6979857","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6979857","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-length analysis for secret random number generation and coding theorems","abstract":"Shannon theory had been considered as an unpractical engineering theory because the obtained optimizations focused on the asymptotic analysis, which are far from a practical setting. However, recent progresses are resolving this defect from achieving finite-length analysis on several information theoretical topics based on the traditional asymptotic results. These progresses enable us to evaluate the performances of realizable systems. The main factors of this research stream are the reflection for the traditional stream and the progress of the method of information spectrum, which has mainly been developed in Japan. However, we cannot ignore the effect by the min entropy developed in cryptography community and the practical demands required by the quantum cryptography system. As results, the finite-length theory has been developed in an interdisciplinary area across information theory community, the communication theory, cryptography theory, and quantum information theory. In this talk, we review the finite-length analysis for the secure random number generation as the most successful case, and briefly explain its extension to source coding, channel coding, and the quantum extension.","publicationTitle":"2014 International Symposium on Information Theory and its Applications","startPage":"322","endPage":"326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6979787","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968713/6979787/06979857.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Symposium on Information Theory and its Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Entropy","Channel coding","Random number generation","Data compression","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","cryptography","information theory","random number generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite-length analysis","secret random number generation","coding theorems","Shannon theory","unpractical engineering theory","asymptotic analysis","information theoretical topics","information spectrum","min entropy","cryptography community","quantum cryptography system","finite-length theory","information theory community","communication theory","cryptography theory","quantum information theory","secure random number generation","source coding","channel coding","quantum extension"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-length analysis","secure random number","data compression","channel coding","quantum information"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Finite-length analysis for secret random number generation and coding theorems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979857/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6979857/","accessionNumber":"14812388","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-length analysis for secret random number generation and coding theorems","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p322hayashi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057075S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968713","isNumber":"6979787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968713","xplore-issue":"6979787","articleId":"6979857","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6979873,"authors":[{"name":"Maksym A.

Due to the broadcast nature of wireless channels possibility of eavesdropping the transmission is provided for non-legitimate receivers. In the present paper, we consider a multi-antenna wiretap channel in a fast-fading environment with only statistical channel state information available at the receiver. The overall performance of such channel is characterized by the ergodic secrecy capacity, which, in general, cannot be characterized explicitly. Nevertheless, based on the assumption that the numbers of antennas at legitimate terminals and the number of eavesdroppers grow large without bound, we derive a deterministic approximation for the achievable ergodic secrecy rate under arbitrary channel inputs. The obtained large-system approximation matches well with the actual simulated secrecy rates, revealing some interesting behavior of the secrecy rates in the given scenario.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Symposium on Information Theory and its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968713/6979787/06979873.pdf","startPage":"398","endPage":"402","publicationTitle":"2014 International Symposium on Information Theory and its Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6979787","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6979873","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the ergodic secrecy capacity of MIMO wiretap channels with statistical CSI","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Approximation methods","Receivers","Antennas","Phase shift keying","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","approximation theory","channel capacity","fading channels","MIMO communication","radio receivers","statistical analysis","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deterministic approximation","legitimate terminals","radio receiver","fast fading environment","multiantenna wiretap channel","nonlegitimate receivers","transmission eavesdropping","wireless channels possibility","broadcast nature","wireless networks","wireless security","statistical CSI","statistical channel state information","ergodic secrecy capacity","MIMO wiretap channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979873/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"On the ergodic secrecy capacity of MIMO wiretap channels with statistical CSI","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6979873/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14819281","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the ergodic secrecy capacity of MIMO wiretap channels with statistical CSI","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p398girnyk.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052452S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968713","isNumber":"6979787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968713","xplore-issue":"6979787","articleId":"6979873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6979880,"authors":[{"name":"Mao-Ching Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Min-Hsiung, Chia-Yi, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"firstName":"Mao-Ching","lastName":"Chiu","id":"37270652200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-8855-2292-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6979880","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":696},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6979880","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Equations","Australia","Transforms","Random variables","Information theory","Zinc"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codes","polarisation","random processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonbinary polar codes","channel symbol permutations","kernel equation","unitary polar codes","arbitrary q-ary input randomized channel polarization","alphabet permutations","channel randomization concept"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Polar codes","channel polarization"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6979787","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Symposium on Information Theory and its Applications","publicationTitle":"2014 International Symposium on Information Theory and its Applications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-binary polar codes with channel symbol permutations","startPage":"433","endPage":"437","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968713/6979787/06979880.pdf","abstract":"The polar codes generated by the kernel equation are termed as unitary polar codes. It has been shown that q-ary unitary polar codes polarize arbitrary q-ary input channels if q is a prime number. However, this is in general not true if q is not a prime number. To achieve polarization for arbitrary q-ary input channels, the conventional approaches were to modify the kernel using permutations of alphabet inside the kernel, or assign nonunitary entries in the kernel if q is a prime power. In this paper, we propose a different approach by using the concept of channel symbol permutations. We show that unitary polar codes can still polarize arbitrary q-ary input channels if the code symbols from the unitary polar code are randomly mapped to the channel symbols before transmission. By using the channel randomization concept, we show that unitary polar codes polarize arbitrary q-ary input randomized channels. If q is a prime power, some sequences of fixed channel symbol permutations are given that, with unitary polar codes, guarantee polarization for arbitrary q-ary input channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979880/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6979880/","accessionNumber":"14812385","displayDocTitle":"Non-binary polar codes with channel symbol permutations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-binary polar codes with channel symbol permutations","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p433chiu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066358S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968713","isNumber":"6979787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968713","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6979787","articleId":"6979880","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6979881,"authors":[{"name":"Harish Vangala","affiliation":["Dept. of ECSE, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC 3800, Australia"],"firstName":"Harish","lastName":"Vangala","id":"38233166800"},{"name":"Emanuele Viterbo","affiliation":["Dept. of ECSE, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC 3800, Australia"],"firstName":"Emanuele","lastName":"Viterbo","id":"37284379900"},{"name":"Yi Hong","affiliation":["Dept. of ECSE, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC 3800, Australia"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Hong","id":"37276995200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-8855-2292-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6979881","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":3835},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6979881","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Complexity theory","Standards","Encoding","Australia","Vectors","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","error correction codes","graph theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding algorithm","decoder graph","permuted graph","encoder","decoding performance","permuted successive cancellation decoder","PSCD","performance degradation","polar code construction rule","reversal permutation","natural decoding order"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Successive cancellation decoder","permuted successive cancellation decoder","decoding order","permuted polar code construction","permutation invariance of the polar encoder"]}],"abstract":"We study a new variant of Arikan's successive cancellation decoder (SCD) for polar codes. We first propose a new decoding algorithm on a new decoder graph, where the various stages of the graph are permuted. We then observe that, even though the usage of the permuted graph doesn't affect the encoder, it can significantly affect the decoding performance of a given polar code. The new permuted successive cancellation decoder (PSCD) typically exhibits a performance degradation, since the polar code is optimized for the standard SCD. We then present a new polar code construction rule matched to the PSCD and show their performance in simulations. For all rates we observe that the polar code matched to a given PSCD performs the same as the original polar code with the standard SCD. We also see that a PSCD with a reversal permutation can lead to a natural decoding order, avoiding the standard bit-reversal decoding order in SCD without any loss in performance.","publicationTitle":"2014 International Symposium on Information Theory and its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Symposium on Information Theory and its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968713/6979787/06979881.pdf","startPage":"438","endPage":"442","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6979787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Permuted successive cancellation decoder for polar codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979881/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Permuted successive cancellation decoder for polar codes","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6979881/","accessionNumber":"14812398","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Permuted successive cancellation decoder for polar codes","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p438vangala.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04801S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968713","isNumber":"6979787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968713","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6979787","articleId":"6979881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6979882,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Trifonov","affiliation":["Saint-Petersburg State Polytechnic University"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Trifonov","id":"37266351900"},{"name":"Vera Miloslavskaya","affiliation":["Saint-Petersburg State Polytechnic University"],"firstName":"Vera","lastName":"Miloslavskaya","id":"37541599400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-8855-2292-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6979882","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":296},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Vectors","Error probability","Matrix decomposition","Australia","Generators","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","encoding","error statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["twisted polar codes","dynamic frozen symbols","directed search successive cancellation decoding algorithm","average complexity","error probability","twisted encoding scheme"]}],"abstract":"A novel construction of polar codes with dynamic frozen symbols and twisted encoding scheme is proposed.

Simulation results validate our analysis.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Symposium on Information Theory and its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968713/6979787/06979896.pdf","startPage":"511","endPage":"515","publicationTitle":"2014 International Symposium on Information Theory and its Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6979787","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6979896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic reduced-rank MMSE in asynchronous MC-DS-CDMA systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Multiaccess communication","Fading","Delays","Australia","Detectors","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","least mean squares methods","radio receivers","random processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic reduced-rank MMSE receiver","asynchronous MC-DS-CDMA systems","asynchronous multicarrier-direct sequence-code division multiple access systems","asymptotic MMSE filter designs","large system regime","spreading gain","subcarriers","asymptotic weights","spreading sequences"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979896/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic reduced-rank MMSE in asynchronous MC-DS-CDMA systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6979896/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14812400","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic reduced-rank MMSE in asynchronous MC-DS-CDMA systems","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p511chien.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059783S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968713","isNumber":"6979787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968713","xplore-issue":"6979787","articleId":"6979896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6979897,"authors":[{"name":"Ainiwan Abudoukeremu","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguhi, Japan"],"firstName":"Ainiwan","lastName":"Abudoukeremu","id":"38580664500"},{"name":"Jincheng Huang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Yancheng Institute of Technology, Yancheng, Jiangsu, P.R.

However, the strong dependencies between user equipment, base stations, and the Evolved Packet Core limit the flexibility, manageability, and resilience of such networks. If the communication links between UE-eNB or eNB-EPC are disrupted, mobile terminals are unable to communicate. In this article, we reshape the 4G mobile network to move toward more virtual and distributed architectures to improve disaster resilience and drastically reduce the dependency between UE, eNBs, and EPC. First, we present the flexible management entity, a distributed entity that leverages on virtualized EPC functionalities in 4G cellular systems. Second, we introduce a novel device-to-device communication scheme allowing the UE in physical proximity to communicate directly without resorting to coordination with an eNB or EPC entity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979954/","volume":"52","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6979954/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14824217","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 2014","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Enabling disaster-resilient 4G mobile communication networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enabling disaster-resilient 4G mobile communication networks","sourcePdf":"014RASHEED_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060356S","chronDate":"December  2014","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6979940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6979940","articleId":"6979954","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6979956,"authors":[{"name":"Jo Ueyama","affiliation":["University of S\u00e3o Paulo"],"bio":{"p":["J \u00f3 Ueyama (joueyama@icmc.usp.br) completed his Ph.D. in computer science at the University of Lancaster, United Kingdom, in 2006.

These faults can give rise to serious problems if WSNs do not have a reconfiguration mechanism at execution. It should be noted that many WSNs designed to detect natural disasters are deployed in inhospitable places and depend on multihop communication to allow the data to reach a sink node. As a result, a fault in a single node can leave a part of the system inoperable until the node recovers from this failure. In light of this, this article outlines a solution that entails employing unmanned aerial vehicles to reduce the problems arising from faults in a sensor network when monitoring natural disasters like floods and landslides. In the solution put forward, UAVs can be transported to the site of the disaster to mitigate problems caused by faults (e.g., by serving as routers or even acting as a data mule). Experiments conducted with real UAVs and with our WSN-based prototype for flood detection (already deployed in S\u00e3o Carlos, State of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, have proven that this is a viable approach.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2014.6979956","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2014.6979956","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/6979940/06979956.pdf","startPage":"81","endPage":"87","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6979940","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting the use of unmanned aerial vehicles to provide resilience in wireless sensor networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6979956/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting the use of unmanned aerial vehicles to provide resilience in wireless sensor networks","volume":"52","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 2014","accessionNumber":"14824225","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6979956/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting the use of unmanned aerial vehicles to provide resilience in wireless sensor networks","sourcePdf":"016UEYAMA_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075843S","chronDate":"December  2014","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6979940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6979940","articleId":"6979956","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6979962,"authors":[{"name":"Shu Sun","affiliation":["NYU WIRELESS and New York University"],"bio":{"p":["Shu Sun(ss7152@nyu.edu) received her B.S. degree in applied physics from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, in 2012.
