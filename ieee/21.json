The equalizer can accommodate quaternary phase-shift keying (QPSK), and 16, 64, and 256 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and achieves a peak throughput rate of 480 MB/s. The chip contains four complex-valued programmable filter taps and incorporates coefficient updating circuitry for implementing the LMS adaptive algorithm with user-selectable adaptation step sizes. Cut-set retiming architecture techniques were used so that the chips could be cascaded to implement longer equalizer lengths without any speed degradation, and a circuit design technique called adaptively biased pseudo-NMOS logic (APNL) was adopted to reduce on-chip critical-path delays. The fully parallel chip architecture achieves a computational throughput of 1.44 billion operations per second (GOPS).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.210000","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/5446/00210000.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.210000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446","startPage":"330","endPage":"338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 60 MBd, 480 Mb/s, 256 QAM decision-feedback equalizer in 1.2 mu m CMOS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=210000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 60 MBd, 480 Mb/s, 256 QAM decision-feedback equalizer in 1.2 mu m CMOS","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/210000/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1993","accessionNumber":"4409534","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 60 MBd, 480 Mb/s, 256 QAM decision-feedback equalizer in 1.2 mu m CMOS","sourcePdf":"00210000.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036439S","chronDate":"Mar 1993","isNumber":"5446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"26","articleId":"210000","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":210006,"authors":[{"name":"J.B.

It uses new types of bus driver circuits and bus receiver circuits to reduce the bus signal swing while maintaining a low standby current. The bus driver circuit has a source offset configuration, achieved by the use of low-V/sub T/ MOSFETs and an internal supply voltage corresponding to the reduced signal swing. The bus receiver circuit has a symmetric configuration with two-level conversion circuits, each of which consists of a transmission gate and a cross-coupled latch circuit. Fast level conversion is achieved without increasing the standby current. The combination of the new bus driver and receiver enables the bus swing to be reduced to one-third that of the conventional architecture while maintaining high-speed data transmission and a low standby current. A test circuit designed and fabricated using 0.3- mu m processes verifies the operation of the proposed architecture.

Various approaches to reducing substrate crosstalk (the use of physical separation of analog and digital circuits, guard rings, and a low-inductance substrate bias) are evaluated experimentally for a CMOS technology with a substrate comprising an epitaxial layer grown on a heavily doped bulk wafer. Observations indicate that reducing the inductance in the substrate bias is the most effective. Device simulations are used to show how crosstalk propagates via the heavily doped bulk and to predict the nature of substrate crosstalk in CMOS technologies integrated in uniform, lightly doped bulk substrates, showing that in such cases the substrate noise is highly dependent on layout geometry.

Through the development of the interpolated-parallel scheme, the severe requirement for the transistor V/sub be/ matching can be alleviated drastically, which improves differential nonlinearity (DNL) significantly to within +or-0.4 LSB. Furthermore, an extremely small input capacitance of 8 pF can be attained, which translates into better dynamic performance such as SNR of 56 dB and THD of -59 dB for an input frequency of 10 MHz. Additionally, the folded differential logic circuit has been developed to reduce the number of elements, power dissipation, and die area drastically. Consequently, the A/D converter has been implemented as a 9.0-mm*4.2-mm chip integrating 36 K elements, which consumes 4.0 W using a 1.0- mu m-rule, 25-GHz f/sub t/, double-polysilicon self-aligned bipolar technology.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.210026","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/5447/00210026.pdf","startPage":"438","endPage":"446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.210026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 10-b 300-MHz interpolated-parallel A/D converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=210026","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/210026/","displayDocTitle":"A 10-b 300-MHz interpolated-parallel A/D converter","volume":"28","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1993","accessionNumber":"4424229","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 10-b 300-MHz interpolated-parallel A/D converter","sourcePdf":"00210026.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070133S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"30","articleId":"210026","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":210027,"authors":[{"name":"C.S.G.

Techniques are employed to minimize the effect of mismatches across the array. A key circuit issue is the design of a high-speed sample-and-hold (S/H) amplifier: a fully differential, mostly NMOS, non-folded-cascode operational-amplifier topology is used. An experimental chip was implemented in 1- mu m CMOS and 8-b resolution at a sample rate of 85 megasamples per second (MS/s) was obtained.

This scheme connects two identical DRAM circuits in series between V/sub ixt/ and V/sub ss/. By operation of two DRAM circuits with the same clock timing, the voltage between two DRAMs, V/sub int/, is automatically fixed to 1/2V/sub ext/.

The design tradeoffs are described. It is shown that for the fine-frequency estimator a good method is to fit a Gaussian function to the fast-Fourier-transform (FFT) peak and its two neighbors. This method achieves a frequency standard deviation and a bias in the order of only a few percent of a bin. In the case of short-time stationarity, for a moderate number of averages and for an adaptive threshold detector, only between 0.5 and 1 dB is lost when averaging is traded off for FFT length, in contrast to the asymptotic result of 1.5 dB. The COSPAS-SARSAT satellite system for emergency detection and localization is used to illustrate the concepts.

A hit is a received signal from a target or background clutter which provides positional information. If an incorrect hit is associated with a track, that track could diverge and terminate. Prior methods for this data association problem include various optimal and suboptimal two-dimensional assignment algorithms which make hit-to-track associations. Another method is to assign a weight for the reasonable hits and use a weighted centroid of those hits to update the track. The method of weighting the hits is known as joint probabilistic data association (JPDA). The authors review the JPDA approach and a simple ad hoc approximation and then introduce a new suboptimal JPDA algorithm.

The full band may not be covered because of an attempt to avoid interfering signals, limited radiometer resources, lack of knowledge of the band frequency location, or combinations of these factors. The analysis provides for calculation of the value of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) required to achieve a given probability of detection for a specified false-alarm rate, assuming an observation interval equivalent to N hops using either a fixed or a moving observation window. The dependence of the probability of detection on a misalignment of the detector observation intervals with the hop transitions is also analyzed. Numerical results are presented and discussed. Applied to a typical slow-hopping VHF radio, the results imply that a 150-hop transmission can be detected by a channelized radiometer covering half the hopping band when the SNR is about 2 dB.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.210091","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/5449/00210091.pdf","startPage":"540","endPage":"553","doi":"10.1109/7.210091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-hopping signal detection using partial band coverage","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-hopping signal detection using partial band coverage","volume":"29","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1993","accessionNumber":"4439291","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/210091/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-hopping signal detection using partial band coverage","sourcePdf":"210091.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028578S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5449","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"23","articleId":"210091","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":210093,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The sensors can be active or passive. The source of a detection can be either a real target, in which case the measurement is the true observation variable of the target plus measurement noise, or a spurious one, i.e. a false alarm. The sensors may have nonunity detection probabilities. The problem is to associate the measurements from sensors to identify the real targets, and to obtain their position estimates. Mathematically this leads to a generalized 3D assignment problem, which is known to be NP-hard. An algorithm suited for estimating the positions of a large number of targets in a dense cluster, using a fast, but nearly optimal, 3D assignment algorithm, is presented. Performance results for several representative test cases with 64 targets are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/7.210094","startPage":"560","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/5449/00210094.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.210094","endPage":"568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multisensor-multitarget data association algorithm for heterogeneous sensors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/210094/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","displayDocTitle":"A multisensor-multitarget data association algorithm for heterogeneous sensors","volume":"29","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4439294","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multisensor-multitarget data association algorithm for heterogeneous sensors","sourcePdf":"210094.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040353S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5449","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"44","articleId":"210094","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":210110,"authors":[{"name":"G.F.

On this premise one can greatly simplify the computation of radiation integrals by eliminating in advance those spectral components of the Green's function not expected to be present in the fields. This approach enables one to dispense with the notion of basis functions and, instead, represent fields and currents as well as the impedance matrix representing the Green's function entirely in terms of a sparse set of samples, thereby obviating the need for integration. Moreover, by taking full advantage of the band-limited character of the solution, this sampling theoretical approach yields an efficient representation with a minimal number of degrees of freedom. The method was explored for scattering from two-dimensional perfect electric conductors including ellipsoidal cylinders and flat strips, in both polarizations, using uniform as well as nonuniform sampling, and yielded surprisingly good results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.210110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.210110","startPage":"20","endPage":"24","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/5450/00210110.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling method using prefiltered band-limited Green's functions for the solution of electromagnetic integral equations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1993","displayDocTitle":"Sampling method using prefiltered band-limited Green's functions for the solution of electromagnetic integral equations","publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"41","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4439234","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/210110/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling method using prefiltered band-limited Green's functions for the solution of electromagnetic integral equations","sourcePdf":"00210110.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027288S","chronDate":"Jan 1993","isNumber":"5450","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"11","articleId":"210110","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":210111,"authors":[{"name":"Chien-Chang Huang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chien-Chang Huang","id":"37087785124"},{"name":"Tah-Hsiung Chu","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tah-Hsiung Chu","id":"37087164480"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"210111","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":272},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wire","Frequency domain analysis","Electromagnetic scattering","Light scattering","Radar scattering","Time domain analysis","Steady-state","Moment methods","Loaded antennas","EMP radiation effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave scattering","frequency-domain analysis","radar cross-sections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic scattering","numerical simulation","wire scatterers","time-harmonic loads","frequency domain","time-harmonic scattering properties","method of moments","harmonic balance technique","conversion matrix technique","steady-state response","nonlinear loads","radar cross section","RCS","intermodulation phenomenon"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=210111","abstract":"The time-harmonic scattering properties of wire scatterers with nonlinear or time-harmonic loads are analyzed in the frequency domain.

The stopband behavior exhibited at broadside scan in the single-strip grating antenna is characteristic of all periodic leaky-wave antennas having a single strip per unit cell, and results in a drastic increase in the attenuation rate of the leaky wave as the beam is scanned to broadside. By nearly eliminating this stopband behavior, the double-strip leaky-wave antenna can scan from backward end fire to forward end fire without any large frequency regions of high attenuation. An approximate design rule for the double-strip antenna is discussed, and results are presented to show how the antenna may be further optimized to achieve the minimum possible variation in attenuation as the beam is scanned through broadside. Although the stopband behavior is never completely eliminated with the addition of the extra strip, the optimum design shows an almost negligible region of rapidly varying attenuation near broadside.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.210112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5450","startPage":"31","endPage":"37","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/5450/00210112.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.210112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadside radiation from periodic leaky-wave antennas","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Leaky wave antennas","Gratings","Dielectrics","Attenuation","Apertures","Tellurium","Slabs","Fires","Frequency","Polarization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna theory","dielectric-loaded antennas","waveguide antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadside radiation","transverse equivalent network","dielectric-inset waveguide","periodic leaky-wave antennas","double-strip grating","stopband behavior","backward end fire","forward end fire","approximate design rule","attenuation","optimum design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1993","displayDocTitle":"Broadside radiation from periodic leaky-wave antennas","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/210112/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"41","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4439236","publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadside radiation from periodic leaky-wave antennas","sourcePdf":"00210112.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040031S","chronDate":"Jan 1993","isNumber":"5450","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"115","articleId":"210112","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":210117,"authors":[{"name":"J.-J.

This formulation can be used with any body of arbitrary three-dimensional geometry, of perfectly conducting material or dielectric, with locally inhomogeneous and anisotropic behavior laws, and with or without dielectric losses. The mathematical formulation is presented along with applications validating it. The exterior problem is treated by the integral equation method while local equations are used for the dielectric parts of the body. A global variational formulation of the coupled problem is developed for use in discretization by the finite element method. Boundary finite elements are used for integral operators connected with the exterior problem. Localized finite elements are used for the interior problem.

Algorithms are proposed for the solution of the robotic (eye-in-hand configuration) visual tracking and servoing problem. Visual tracking is stated as a problem of combining control with computer vision. The sum-of-squared differences optical flow is used to compute the vector of discrete displacements. The displacements are fed to an adaptive controller (self-tuning regulator) that creates commands for a robot control system. The procedure is based on the online estimation of the relative distance of the target from the camera, but only partial knowledge of the relative distance is required, obviating the need for offline calibration. Three different adaptive control schemes have been implemented, both in simulation and in experiments. The computational complexity and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can be implemented in real time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive robotic visual tracking: theory and experiments","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/9.210141","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/5451/00210141.pdf","startPage":"429","endPage":"445","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.210141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5451","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=210141","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/210141/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1993","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive robotic visual tracking: theory and experiments","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1993","accessionNumber":"4443012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive robotic visual tracking: theory and experiments","sourcePdf":"00210141.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055871S","chronDate":"Mar 1993","isNumber":"5451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"155","articleId":"210141","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":210149,"authors":[{"name":"M.M.

In these systems, the nodes represent components and the edges represent fault propagation between the components. Some of the components are equipped with alarms that become active in response to faulty conditions. Two algorithms, FORWARD and BACKWARD, for computing the set of all potential candidates for a single fault that corresponds to a given set of active alarms, are studied. FORWARD moves forward from candidate nodes checking to see if they satisfy the alarm condition, and BACKWARD moves backwards from the alarms. In terms of worst-case time complexity, BACKWARD is better. These algorithms are analyzed using systems that are uniformly and randomly generated. In terms of the expected number of distinct nodes that are visited, FORWARD is shown to be better, and in terms of the total number of node visits, BACKWARD is found to be better.

The important question which arises is how much precision is required to implement neural network algorithms on this low precision hardware. A theoretical analysis of error due to finite precision computation was undertaken to determine the necessary precision for successful forward retrieving and back-propagation learning in a multilayer perceptron.

The NTN is grown by a learning algorithm, as opposed to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), where the architecture must be specified before learning can begin. A heuristic learning algorithm based on minimizing the L1 norm of the error is used to grow the NTN. It is shown that this method has better performance in terms of minimizing the number of classification errors than the squared error minimization method used in backpropagation. An optimal pruning algorithm is given to enhance the generalization of the NTN. Simulation results are presented on Boolean function learning tasks and a speaker independent vowel recognition task.

The dynamic link architecture exploits correlations in the fine-scale temporal structure of cellular signals to group neurons dynamically into higher-order entities. These entities represent a rich structure and can code for high-level objects. To demonstrate the capabilities of the dynamic link architecture, a program was implemented that can recognize human faces and other objects from video images. Memorized objects are represented by sparse graphs, whose vertices are labeled by a multiresolution description in terms of a local power spectrum, and whose edges are labeled by geometrical distance vectors. Object recognition can be formulated as elastic graph matching, which is performed here by stochastic optimization of a matching cost function. The implementation on a transputer network achieved recognition of human faces and office objects from gray-level camera images. The performance of the program is evaluated by a statistical analysis of recognition results from a portrait gallery comprising images of 87 persons.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.210173","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/5452/00210173.pdf","startPage":"300","endPage":"311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5452","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.210173","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=210173","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distortion invariant object recognition in the dynamic link architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/210173/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1993","displayDocTitle":"Distortion invariant object recognition in the dynamic link architecture","volume":"42","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4419406","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distortion invariant object recognition in the dynamic link architecture","sourcePdf":"00210173.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056338S","chronDate":"Mar 1993","isNumber":"5452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"1189","articleId":"210173","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":210176,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

The most important property of OSD number representation systems is the possibility of performing carry-free addition and (by changing all the digit signs in the subtrahend) borrow-free subtraction. Generalized signed-digit (GSD) number systems cover all useful redundant number representations as special cases. Most GSD number systems support carry-free addition and borrow-free subtraction, and even those that do not can be dealt with using limited-carry or limited-borrow algorithms which yield the ith sum or difference digit z/sub i /as a function of the digits x/sub i/, y/sub i/, x/sub i-1/, y/sub i-1/, x/sub i-2/ and y/sub i-2/ of the operands x and y. Additional topics that are important for practical implementation of arithmetic functions using GSD number systems are treated. Because GSD number systems may have asymmetric digit sets, one must consider subtraction (or at least sign change for representations with alpha >0 and beta >0) explicitly. Zero detection, sign detection, and overflow handling are also treated in depth.<<ETX>>","doi":"10.1109/12.210182","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/5452/00210182.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.210182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5452","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"379","endPage":"384","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the implementation of arithmetic support functions for generalized signed-digit number systems","volume":"42","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4419415","publicationDate":"March 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/210182/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the implementation of arithmetic support functions for generalized signed-digit number systems","sourcePdf":"00210182.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033267S","chronDate":"Mar 1993","isNumber":"5452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"24","articleId":"210182","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":210197,"authors":[{"name":"T.B.

The fundamental circuit ideas developed by the authors in Part I are applied to practical circuits, and the impact of neuron MOSFET on the implementation of binary-logic circuits is examined. For this purpose, two techniques are presented to simplify the circuit configurations. It is shown that the input-stage D/A converter circuit in the basic configuration can be eliminated without any major problems, resulting in improved noise margins and speed performance. Then a design technique for symmetric functions, which is especially important when the number of input variables increases, is presented. The nu MOS logic design is characterized by a large reduction in the number of transistors as well as of interconnections. However, the decrease in transistor count comes at a cost in process tolerance due to the multivalued nature of the device operation. Test circuits were fabricated by a typical double-polysilicon CMOS process, and the measurement results are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.210207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.210207","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/5453/00210207.pdf","startPage":"974","endPage":"979","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neuron MOS binary-logic integrated circuits.

The densities of the traps are calculated using the tunneling front model and analyzing the transient currents that flowed through the oxide after removal of the stress voltage pulses. It is found that the trap distributions are relatively uniform throughout the small portion of the oxide sampled by the transient currents. The trap densities increase as the cube root of the fluence of electrons that passes through the oxide during the stress, independent of the stress polarity. The voltage dependence of the low-level pretunneling current is dependent on the sequence in which the stress voltage polarities and the low-level current measurement polarities are applied. The portion of the low-level pre-tunneling current that is not dependent on the polarity sequence is best fitted by a voltage dependence consistent with Schottky emission.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/210209/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"May 1993","accessionNumber":"4424249","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"40","issue":"5","displayDocTitle":"Correlation of stress-induced leakage current in thin oxides with trap generation inside the oxides","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correlation of stress-induced leakage current in thin oxides with trap generation inside the oxides","sourcePdf":"00210209.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04569S","chronDate":"May 1993","isNumber":"5453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"191","articleId":"210209","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":210223,"authors":[{"name":"J.L.R.

Since this material removes the necessity of the phantom shell, the surface SAR distribution can be readily obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dry phantom composed of ceramics and its application to SAR estimation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.210240","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/5454/00210240.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.210240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5454","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=210240","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/210240/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1993","displayDocTitle":"Dry phantom composed of ceramics and its application to SAR estimation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","accessionNumber":"4424290","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dry phantom composed of ceramics and its application to SAR estimation","sourcePdf":"00210240.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035255S","chronDate":"Jan 1993","isNumber":"5454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"58","articleId":"210240","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":210245,"authors":[{"name":"P.H.

HUTSCAT, a helicopter-borne dual-frequency FM-CW scatterometer, is described. The HUTSCAT measures the backscattering properties of a target with a range resolution of 65 cm. The real-time ranging capability is obtained by performing the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to the received time-domain signal. The measurement is made simultaneously at eight channels (VV, HH, HV, and VH modes of polarization at 5.4 GHz and 9.8 GHz). The scatterometer measures the radar return spectrum for eight channels in 16.6 ms, which corresponds to an along-track distance of 0.33 m for the helicopter speed of 20 m/s.

These changes are strongly correlated with elevation and hill-slope orientation and are greatest on some of the elevated areas and weaker in river drainages. By constructing difference images using various image pairs, and by analyzing climatological and hydrological data from the site, it is concluded that the radar backscatter changes are largely due to changes in soil and vegetation liquid water content induced by freeze/thaw events. The correlation with topography in the difference images arises from the dependence of vegetation, organic layer thickness, and volumetric water content on hill-slope position and orientation. These results demonstrate the viability of radar backscatter intensity comparisons using repeat-pass images as a means of change detection.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/210462/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1993","volume":"31","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","accessionNumber":"4429255","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Change detection on Alaska's North Slope using repeat-pass ERS-1 SAR images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Change detection on Alaska's North Slope using repeat-pass ERS-1 SAR images","sourcePdf":"00210462.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036799S","chronDate":"Jan 1993","isNumber":"5461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"46","articleId":"210462","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":210464,"authors":[{"name":"S.N.

The processor was tested using data acquired with extreme aircraft motion so that performance could be evaluated under adverse conditions. The topographic maps generated by the radar were compared to digital elevation models (DEMs) derived using conventional optical stereo techniques. In one region, the RMS elevation deviations measured were less than the specified DEM accuracy, and, in the region covered by the more accurate DEM, errors varied from 2.2 m RMS in relatively flat terrain up to 5.0 m in mountainous area. The RMS difference between radar and DEM elevation over the 6.5-km by 22-km area covered by the more accurate DEM was 3.6 m.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.210464","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","startPage":"246","endPage":"256","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/5461/00210464.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.210464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Topographic mapping using radar interferometry: processing techniques","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar interferometry","Laser radar","NASA","Motion compensation","Testing","Ultraviolet sources","Aircraft","Digital elevation models","Nonlinear optics","Optical interferometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cartography","geophysical techniques","remote sensing by radar","topography (Earth)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SAR","land surface","cartography","measurement","technique","topography","mapping","radar interferometry","processing algorithm","NASA JPL TOPSAR","topographic radar mapper","motion compensation","three-dimensional target location algorithm","phase ambiguity","height maps","terrain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1993","displayDocTitle":"Topographic mapping using radar interferometry: processing techniques","volume":"31","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4429257","publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/210464/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topographic mapping using radar interferometry: processing techniques","sourcePdf":"00210464.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039775S","chronDate":"Jan 1993","isNumber":"5461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"196","articleId":"210464","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":210524,"authors":[{"name":"U.

The algorithm is well suited for interframe HDTV coding applications and facilitates conversions and interactions between different video coding standards.

For processing and transmission of image signals, a low-complexity codec without visible degradation is desired. A low-complexity intraframe subband image coding algorithm is developed. The low band is DPCM encoded and the high bands are PCM encoded. An efficient entropy coder is designed which reduces the overall bit rate significantly. It is shown that high-quality HDTV images can be obtained at as low a bit rate as 45 Mb/s or less with a very low-complexity encoder. For dividing the image into subbands, a new class of quadrature mirror filters (QMFs) called generalized quadrature mirror filters (GQMFs) is used for filtering. Performance is also evaluated by using short kernel filters (SKFs), which are easy to implement and require very few computations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity subband encoding for HDTV images","doi":"10.1109/49.210546","startPage":"77","endPage":"87","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.210546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5464","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/5464/00210546.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=210546","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/210546/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1993","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity subband encoding for HDTV images","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"11","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","accessionNumber":"4423870","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity subband encoding for HDTV images","sourcePdf":"00210546.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046423S","chronDate":"Jan 1993","isNumber":"5464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"9","articleId":"210546","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":210551,"authors":[{"name":"L.-F.

All three of the involved system elements: the laser, the fiber amplifier, and the transmission fiber, contribute to the system distortion. The laser distortion originates from the internal photon-electron interaction, whereas the fiber amplifier and dispersive distortion are directly related to the intrinsic frequency chirping of the modulated laser. From the distortion magnitude and phase analysis, the author finds that under most situations the distortions have an electronic counterpart and can be electronically compensated. In addition, the system distortion can be minimized with a combination of critically chosen elements that have minimum or counteracting distortion mechanisms. Optically amplified AM-SCM systems can thus be engineered to perform well within the stringent distortion requirements for both 1.3- and 1.55-\u03bcm wavelength ranges.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber amplifiers","Optical fiber dispersion","Optical distortion","Frequency modulation","Nonlinear distortion","Chirp"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude modulation","fibre lasers","optical links","optical modulation","subcarrier multiplexing","video signals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["1.3 micron","1.55 micron","AM subcarrier multiplexed","AM-SCM","IR","analog links","counteracting distortion mechanisms","dispersive distortion","distortion magnitude","distortion requirements","electronically compensated","fiber amplifiers","internal photon-electron interaction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/50.210564","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/5465/00210564.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5465","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.210564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamental nonlinear distortions in analog links with fiber amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=210564","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental nonlinear distortions in analog links with fiber amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/210564/","volume":"11","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4413744","dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"January  1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental nonlinear distortions in analog links with fiber amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00210564.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057466S","chronDate":"January  1993","isNumber":"5465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"14","articleId":"210564","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":210566,"authors":[{"name":"Robert M.

Digital encoding using pulse position modulation (PPM) is proposed, having advantages that permit efficient integration of optical and electronic processing. Data recovery is achieved by optical correlation for sequence recognition, followed by standard electronic PPM decoding. The relation between key system parameters of the encoding, decoding, and optics is derived, and indicates that compressed video rates between 5 and 20 Mb/s/channel, with 25-50 channels, is possible with relatively standard hardware.

Visual tracking is formulated as a problem of combining control with computer vision. A mathematical formulation of the control problem that includes information from a novel feedback vision sensor and represents everything with respect to the camera frame is presented. The sum-of-squared differences (SSD) optical flow is used to compute the vector of discrete displacements each instant of time. These displacements can be fed either directly to a PI (proportional-integral) controller or to a pole assignment controller or discrete steady-state Kalman filter. In the latter case, the Kalman filter calculates the estimated values of the system's states and the exogenous disturbances, and a discrete LQG (linear-quadratic Gaussian) controller computes the desired motion of the robotic system. The outputs of the controllers are sent to the Cartesian robotic controller.

With this sensor the position (distance and bearing) of all isolated objects in an approximately 25 degrees field of view can be determined using information contained in one single snapshot of a moderately complex scene. Within limits, the sensor system can also discriminate between different types of reflectors, in particular, walls and edges, based on their radius of curvature. These results are all based on the determination of the arrival times of the echoes present at the three receivers. A noise model that accounts for the measured variations of the arrival times is used to derive limits on the resolution of the results provided by the sensor. Based on this model it is shown that, to a large extent, the sensor results are impervious to measurement variations common to all three receivers. Results obtained in a realistic environment are compared with those obtained from a conventional time-of-flight sensor.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/210793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4430461","displayDocTitle":"A high-resolution sensor based on tri-aural perception","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high-resolution sensor based on tri-aural perception","sourcePdf":"00210793.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036753S","chronDate":"Feb 1993","isNumber":"5477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"201","articleId":"210793","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":210794,"authors":[{"name":"J.D.

It has been integrated into several navigation systems that drive a robot vehicle, the Navlab, on a variety of roads in many different weather conditions. SCARF recognizes roads that have degraded surfaces and edges with no lane markings in difficult shadow conditions. It also recognizes intersections with or without predictions from the navigation system. This is the first system that detects intersections in images without a priori knowledge of the intersection shape and location. SCARF uses Bayesian classification to determine a road-surface likelihood for each pixel in a reduced color image. It then evaluates a number of road and intersection candidates by matching an ideal road-surface likelihood image with the results from the Bayesian classification. The best matching candidate is passed to a path-planning system that navigates the robot vehicle on the road or intersection. The SCARF system is described in detail, results on a variety of images are presented, and Navlab test runs using SCARF are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/70.210794","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/5477/00210794.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"58","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.210794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SCARF: a color vision system that tracks roads and intersections","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=210794","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/210794/","displayDocTitle":"SCARF: a color vision system that tracks roads and intersections","volume":"9","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1993","accessionNumber":"4430462","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SCARF: a color vision system that tracks roads and intersections","sourcePdf":"00210794.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038855S","chronDate":"Feb 1993","isNumber":"5477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"184","articleId":"210794","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":210801,"authors":[{"name":"K.

These policies differ in their basic approaches on how and when the invalidated pages are identified or if the updated pages are propagated to the buffers of the remote nodes. They can be classified as detection, notification (of invalid pages), and (update) propagation oriented approaches. The policies trade off CPU overhead of coherency messages with buffer hit probability in different ways, resulting in a tradeoff of response time and maximum throughput. The main contribution is to develop analytical models to predict buffer hit probabilities under various buffer coherency policies assuming the LRU replacement policy and the independent reference model (IRM). The buffer models are validated using simulation models and show excellent agreement. Integrated analytic models capturing buffer hit probability and CPU overhead are developed to predict the overall response times under these coherency policies. The difference in buffer hit probabilities amongst various policies are found to be very sensitive to the skewness of the data access.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/71.210812","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","startPage":"289","endPage":"305","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/5478/00210812.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.210812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of buffer coherency policies in a multisystem data sharing environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Delay","Predictive models","Analytical models","Throughput","Environmental management","Distributed databases","Transaction databases","File servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","shared memory systems","transaction processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","integrated analytic models","buffer coherency policies","multisystem data sharing environment","multisystem transaction processing environment","detection","notification","propagation oriented approaches","coherency messages","buffer hit probability","response time","maximum throughput","independent reference model","simulation models","CPU overhead"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1993","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of buffer coherency policies in a multisystem data sharing environment","volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4453625","publicationDate":"March 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/210812/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of buffer coherency policies in a multisystem data sharing environment","sourcePdf":"00210812.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044657S","chronDate":"Mar 1993","isNumber":"5478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"19","articleId":"210812","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":210815,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The authors use the knowledge from the given algorithm and the architecture to guide the mapping. The approach begins with a graphical representation of the parallel algorithm (problem graph) and the parallel computer (host graph). Using these representations, the authors generate a new graphical representation (extended host graph) on which the problem graph is mapped. An accurate characterization of the communication overhead is used in the objective functions to evaluate the optimality of the mapping. An efficient mapping scheme is developed which uses two levels of optimization procedures. The objective functions include minimizing the communication overhead and minimizing the total execution time which includes both computation and communication times. The mapping scheme is tested by simulation and further confirmed by mapping a real world application onto actual distributed environments.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.210815","doi":"10.1109/71.210815","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/5478/00210815.pdf","startPage":"328","endPage":"346","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A generalized scheme for mapping parallel algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A generalized scheme for mapping parallel algorithms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/210815/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1993","accessionNumber":"4453628","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A generalized scheme for mapping parallel algorithms","sourcePdf":"00210815.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06194S","chronDate":"Mar 1993","isNumber":"5478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"66","articleId":"210815","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":210825,"authors":[{"name":"D.

A relatively simple beamforming/diffraction model is developed for near-field, wideband, synthetic aperture ultrasonic imaging in NDT systems. The physical model is used to quantitatively evaluate a variety of front-end sensor signal processing tradeoffs for the enhanced detection and sizing of defects. It is shown using statistical microscopic scattering calculations that a combination of increased spatial sampling and rectangular windowing can increase the signal-to-clutter ratio by approximately 10 dB while maintaining crack size resolutions well below future projected specifications. The sensor signal processing image enhancements are demonstrated by the construction of simulated strip-map SAFT (synthetic aperture focusing technique) images of metallic crack defects in the presence of large numbers of randomly distributed clutter (simulated grain boundary) scatterers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.210866","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/5480/00210866.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"67","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.210866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5480","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=210866","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical comparison of sensor signal processing enhancements for NDT synthetic aperture ultrasonic imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analytical comparison of sensor signal processing enhancements for NDT synthetic aperture ultrasonic imaging","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/210866/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1993","volume":"2","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","accessionNumber":"4431080","pubMedId":"18296195","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical comparison of sensor signal processing enhancements for NDT synthetic aperture ultrasonic imaging","sourcePdf":"00210866.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041346S","chronDate":"Jan.  1993","isNumber":"5480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"11","articleId":"210866","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":210873,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This discussion is limited to single event upset (SEU) rate prediction for direct-ionization-induced effects. The standard approach being recommended is based partially on a different way of viewing the results of SEU cross-section measurements. The measurements are not measuring a distribution of cross-sections. They are measuring a distribution of device sensitivities, due to differences of sensitive region critical charges and to differences of charge collection. The linear energy transfer (LET), at which 50% of the cell population upsets, corresponds to the charge deposition necessary to upset the median cell in the circuit array. The threshold LET corresponds to the most sensitive region being hit in its most sensitive location, and does not represent the entire array. The shape of the cross-section curve is described by an integral Weibull distribution. The upset rate for a device should then be calculated using the differential rate of each sensitive region, combined with an integral weighting given by the Weibull distribution that describes the measured cross-section curve.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/211340/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1992","volume":"39","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","accessionNumber":"4404729","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Rate prediction for single event effects-a critique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate prediction for single event effects-a critique","sourcePdf":"00211340.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07739S","chronDate":"Dec.  1992","isNumber":"5513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"205","articleId":"211340","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":211341,"authors":[{"name":"E.L.

Specifically, a simple relationship between the heavy ion LET (linear energy transfer) threshold for upset and the threshold for proton-induced upsets as described by the Bendel A parameter (A=L/sub 0.1/+15) is given. This relationship will enable either proton or heavy ion laboratory measurements to be used for estimating upset rates for both types of particles in space environments. Calculation of upset rates based on LET thresholds indicates that, for some orbits in the proton radiation belt, devices with thresholds of 10 to 45 MeV/mg/cm/sup 2/ might produce unacceptable proton upset rates. The proton upsets for devices with thresholds above 10 MeV/mg/cm/sup 2/ are caused by relatively rare reaction processes that occur at high proton energies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.211341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.211341","endPage":"1604","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/5513/00211341.pdf","startPage":"1600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The relationship of proton and heavy ion upset thresholds","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/211341/","displayDocTitle":"The relationship of proton and heavy ion upset thresholds","volume":"39","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"4404730","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The relationship of proton and heavy ion upset thresholds","sourcePdf":"00211341.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034719S","chronDate":"Dec.  1992","isNumber":"5513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"47","articleId":"211341","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":211342,"authors":[{"name":"G.H.

The accuracy of this assumption is examined for ranges of ion energies and volumes of silicon appropriate for modern microelectronics. It is shown to be accurate only under very restricted conditions. Significant differences arise because (1) LET is related to energy lost by the ion, not energy deposited in the volume; and (2) LET is an average value and does not account for statistical variations in energy deposition. Criteria are suggested for determining when factors other than LET should be considered, and new analytical approaches are presented to account for them. One implication of these results is that improvements can be made in space upset rate predictions by incorporating the new methods into currently used codes such as CREME and CRUP.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applicability of LET to single events in microelectronic structures","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.211343","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/5513/00211343.pdf","startPage":"1613","endPage":"1621","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.211343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=211343","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/211343/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Applicability of LET to single events in microelectronic structures","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","accessionNumber":"4404732","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applicability of LET to single events in microelectronic structures","sourcePdf":"00211343.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050864S","chronDate":"Dec.  1992","isNumber":"5513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"68","articleId":"211343","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":211345,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The SRAMs sensitivity of SEU was found to depend on the arrival time of the laser pulse relative to the time when the cell was addressed. Striking results were found when the light was focused outside the sensitive drains. Whether an upset occurred depended on both the position of the laser spot and the information stored in the cell.

Ion beam testing of the hardened part at low scrub frequencies showed fewer system upsets than that of an unhardened part. At high frequencies, the upset rate increased with frequency, indicating a clock-dependent SEU sensitive node. A pulsed laser was used to identify an input node in the self-scrubbing circuitry as being the source of the upsets at high frequencies. Because the node was only sensitive for a short duration prior to the rising clock edge, more clock-edge-dependent SEUs could occur at higher frequencies. The relative SEU thresholds of the registers and the input node measured with the laser showed excellent agreement with ion data. All single-point SEU failure nodes were identified and their upset thresholds measured. With this information it was possible to redesign the circuit to reduce its sensitivity to SEU at high scrub frequencies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.211351","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/5513/00211351.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.211351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513","startPage":"1665","endPage":"1670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Laser confirmation of SEU experiments in GaAs MESFET combinational logic (for space application)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=211351","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Laser confirmation of SEU experiments in GaAs MESFET combinational logic (for space application)","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/211351/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","accessionNumber":"4404740","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Laser confirmation of SEU experiments in GaAs MESFET combinational logic (for space application)","sourcePdf":"00211351.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048371S","chronDate":"Dec.  1992","isNumber":"5513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"23","articleId":"211351","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":211352,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.

The authors describe the test setup, the hard error characterization, and some first theoretical considerations for explaining this phenomenon.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.211355","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/5513/00211355.pdf","startPage":"1693","endPage":"1697","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.211355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heavy ion induced single hard errors on submicronic memories (for space application)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/211355/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Heavy ion induced single hard errors on submicronic memories (for space application)","volume":"39","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","accessionNumber":"4404744","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heavy ion induced single hard errors on submicronic memories (for space application)","sourcePdf":"00211355.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0439S","chronDate":"Dec.  1992","isNumber":"5513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"39","articleId":"211355","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":211356,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In view of this application, the analog parameters of transistors realized in the Thomson TMS HSO13-HD technology were studied before and after exposure to total doses similar to those expected in the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The devices were irradiated up to 10 Mrad with /sup 60/Co and 3*10/sup 14/ neutrons/cm/sup 2/. The changes in the threshold voltage V/sub th/ of front and back gates, leakage current, and transconductance are studied. Subthreshold slope and charge pumping techniques were used to estimate the interface state formation. Noise measurements in the 0.1-kHz to 3-MHz bandwidth range were performed. The noise is comparable to that of a bulk CMOS process.

Spontaneous discharges were recorded for each sample and were compared to the radiation levels, which were simultaneously monitored. Samples with the most exposed insulator surface (not metallized) pulsed most frequently. Most of the pulses were less than 50 V on 50 Omega . Pulsing correlated weakly with electron flux, but no correlation with proton flux could be discerned. The pulse rate per unit electron flux was initially small, rose continuously for seven months, and then fell slightly during the last seven months. The pulsing rate decayed when the satellite left the electron belts. The decay became more rapid after seven months. There seem to be two kinds of pulses which exhibit differing statistics. One kind dominated during the first seven months, the other during the last seven months. This may be related to the fact that it took several months for electric fields in the samples to approach steady-state levels. A computer simulation predicts the temporal charging of the insulators by the high-energy electron flux.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.211366","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/5513/00211366.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.211366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513","startPage":"1773","endPage":"1782","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characteristics of spontaneous electrical discharging of various insulators in space radiations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=211366","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Characteristics of spontaneous electrical discharging of various insulators in space radiations","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/211366/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","accessionNumber":"4401044","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characteristics of spontaneous electrical discharging of various insulators in space radiations","sourcePdf":"00211366.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046036S","chronDate":"Dec.  1992","isNumber":"5513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"87","articleId":"211366","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-17"},{"_id":211370,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Failure dose was measured with three test protocols: with Method 1019.4, with Method 1019.4 plus a room-temperature anneal, and with 0.2 rad(Si)/s irradiations at static and dynamic bias. In comparing the power-supply current (I/sub DD/) of two commercial field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), it was found that the failure dose for devices with a high annealing rate increased by a factor of ten times when a room-temperature anneal was included, while devices with a slower annealing rate showed almost a two-times improvement in failure dose. Slower-annealing devices showed a higher failure dose when dynamically biased during low dose-rate irradiations, indicating that radiation-induced charge neutralization accelerated recovery in these devices. Methods of characterizing the hardness of MOS ICs using a test flow that includes room-temperature and elevated-temperature anneals are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.211380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.211380","startPage":"1869","endPage":"1875","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/5513/00211380.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Qualifying commercial ICs for space total-dose environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/211380/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Qualifying commercial ICs for space total-dose environments","volume":"39","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4401058","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Qualifying commercial ICs for space total-dose environments","sourcePdf":"00211380.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054052S","chronDate":"Dec.  1992","isNumber":"5513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"32","articleId":"211380","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":211391,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

Following the normal saturation of interface-trap density (within 10/sup 2/ to 10/sup 5/ s after irradiation), large increases in the number of interface traps were observed for both commercial and radiation-hardened transistors at very long times after irradiation (>10/sup 6/ s at 25 degrees ). This latent buildup of interface traps can be significant, up to a factor of four times larger than the normal saturation value. The latent buildup is thermally activated with an activation energy of 0.47+or-0.08 eV. As a natural consequence of the delay between the normal and the latent buildup, there is a window in time in which little or no interface-trap buildup occurs. Two possible mechanisms for the latent buildup are explored: (1) the direct conversion of oxide traps into interface traps or border traps and (2) the diffusion of molecular hydrogen into the gate oxide from adjacent structures. The latent buildup of interface traps can degrade the performance of ICs in space systems and may cause IC failure at long times. Recommendations are provided for characterizing latent interface-trap buildup.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/211391/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1992","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4404755","volume":"39","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Latent interface-trap buildup and its implications for hardness assurance (MOS transistors)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Latent interface-trap buildup and its implications for hardness assurance (MOS transistors)","sourcePdf":"00211391.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056678S","chronDate":"Dec.  1992","isNumber":"5513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"77","articleId":"211391","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":211399,"authors":[{"name":"G.R.

An asymmetric distortion in the hysteresis curves was observed. The distortion depends on the polarization state of the capacitor before irradiation. Postirradiation electrical cycling makes the hysteresis loops symmetric initially, but results in fatigue effects. The leakage and switching current behavior after irradiation and post-rad cycling were studied using a static current versus voltage measurement. Retention and fatigue properties are not worsened after irradiation except for the polarization reduction. The radiation effects are consistent with the sheet charge model. The fatigue effects due to post-rad cycling are consistent with an increase in the space-charge regions near the electrodes or oxygen-deficient dendrite growth.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.211401","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","startPage":"2036","endPage":"2043","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/5513/00211401.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.211401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Total-dose radiation effects on sol-gel derived PZT thin films","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiation effects","Transistors","Capacitors","Hysteresis","Fatigue","Ferroelectric materials","Electrodes","Polarization","Platinum","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dielectric hysteresis","ferroelectric storage","ferroelectric thin films","gamma-ray effects","lead compounds","leakage currents","thin film capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ferroelectric memory material","gamma irradiation","leakage current","total-dose radiation effects","sol-gel derived","open-circuit bias","asymmetric distortion","hysteresis curves","polarization state","capacitor","hysteresis loops","fatigue effects","switching current","post-rad cycling","sheet charge model","space-charge regions","oxygen-deficient dendrite growth","1 Mrad","8.6*10/sup 4/ rad","PZT thin films","PbZrO3TiO3"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Total-dose radiation effects on sol-gel derived PZT thin films","volume":"39","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4404765","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/211401/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Total-dose radiation effects on sol-gel derived PZT thin films","sourcePdf":"00211401.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051747S","chronDate":"Dec.  1992","isNumber":"5513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"43","articleId":"211401","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":211407,"authors":[{"name":"R.E.

By irradiating the oxides with X-rays at cryogenic temperatures, 40-50 K, hole motion is frozen and electrons are trapped. The oxide charge is determined by C-V measurements. Following the cryogenic irradiation, the electrons are detrapped by field stressing (tunneling) or by annealing (thermal excitation). Hole trapping is examined by annealing after the trapped electrons are removed by field stressing. Substantial shallow electron and deep hole trapping distributed uniformly through the oxide is observed for all buried oxides that are processed above about 1100 degrees C. A comparison to thermal oxides grown at 850 degrees C and annealed at 1300 degrees C with and without a polysilicon capping layer shows that the top silicon layer significantly increases trap formation.

Modeling does show that higher bipolar gain than that measured on a sample from the SRAM lot would produce a lower error rate. Measurements show the worst-case supply voltage for SEU to be 5.5 V.

Based on this, SEU experiments with SOI devices should include measurements as a function of supply voltage, rather than the traditional 4.5 V, to determine the worst-case condition.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/5513/00211411.pdf","startPage":"2121","endPage":"2125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An SEU resistant 256 K SOI SRAM","doi":"10.1109/23.211411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.211411","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=211411","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/211411/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1992","displayDocTitle":"An SEU resistant 256 K SOI SRAM","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","accessionNumber":"4404775","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"39","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An SEU resistant 256 K SOI SRAM","sourcePdf":"00211411.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025526S","chronDate":"Dec.  1992","isNumber":"5513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"32","articleId":"211411","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":211421,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

Proton-induced degradation of phosphors such as Y/sub 2/O/sub 2/S:Eu, Gd/sub 2/O/sub 2/S:Pr, and Gd/sub 2/O/sub 2/S:Tb was studied. Materials were selected for high efficiency, fast prompt fluorescence response, and minimal delayed fluorescence. Phosphors were exposed to a 3-MeV proton beam at ambient temperatures to control heating damage. Real-time, in situ measurements of the fluorescence spectra permitted observation of the spectral characteristics for the deterioration of scintillation yield due to particle-induced damage. The light spectra emitted were nearly identical to those excited by electrons, indicating a common excitation process. Rare earth oxysulfides give intense emissions but the corresponding light intensity drops rapidly with dose. Light intensity decreases with dose, following the Birks and Black model where damage sites compete for excitons with light-producting sites. Decay of broadband and spectral peak intensity follows similar patterns.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.211439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.211439","endPage":"2297","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/5513/00211439.pdf","startPage":"2295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectroscopic analysis of proton-induced fluorescence from yttrium and gadolinium oxysulfide phosphors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/211439/","displayDocTitle":"Spectroscopic analysis of proton-induced fluorescence from yttrium and gadolinium oxysulfide phosphors","volume":"39","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"4404781","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectroscopic analysis of proton-induced fluorescence from yttrium and gadolinium oxysulfide phosphors","sourcePdf":"00211439.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044539S","chronDate":"Dec.  1992","isNumber":"5513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"15","articleId":"211439","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":211440,"authors":[{"name":"C.-C.

The drawback of the usual feedforward neural network (FNN) is that it is a static mapping and requires a large number of neurons and takes a long training time. The usual fixed learning rate based on an empirical trial and error scheme is slow and does not guarantee convergence. The DRNN is for dynamic mapping and requires much fewer neurons and weights, and thus converges faster than FNN. A dynamic backpropagation algorithm coupled with an adaptive learning rate guarantees even faster convergence. The DRNN controller described includes both a neurocontroller and a neuroidentifier. A reference model which incorporates an optimal control law with improved reactor temperature response is used for training of the neurocontroller and neuroidentifier. Rapid convergence of this DRNN-based control system is demonstrated when used to improve reactor temperature performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/211440/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1992","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4404782","volume":"39","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Improved nuclear reactor temperature control using diagonal recurrent neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved nuclear reactor temperature control using diagonal recurrent neural networks","sourcePdf":"00211440.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103328S","chronDate":"Dec.  1992","isNumber":"5513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"83","articleId":"211440","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":211450,"authors":[{"name":"R.D.J. van Nee","affiliation":["Telecommunications and Traffic-Control Systems Group, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"R.D.J.","lastName":"van Nee","id":"37347315800"},{"name":"R.

Examination of orthogonal and ISI (intersymbol interference) free pulse shapes leads to the novel demodulator structure. This demodulator is advantageous because the processing is strictly linear, the pilot channel and data channel ideally do not interfere or create self-noise, no differential encoding is required since no phase ambiguity is created with the pilot tone processing, and near ideal bit error probability performance is achieved. This demodulator offers an alternative to the transmitted tone-in-band and the pilot symbol assisted modulation techniques. The author considers pi /4-QPSK modulation with 33% excess bandwidth in the isotropic time-varying fading channel as a design example.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/5514/00211453.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"165","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.211453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.211453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=211453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dual-tone reference digital demodulator for mobile digital communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Demodulation","Digital communication","Decoding","Fading","Pulse modulation","Phase locked loops","Quadrature phase shift keying","Error probability","Binary phase shift keying","Pulse shaping methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulators","digital radio systems","error statistics","intersymbol interference","mobile radio systems","phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal pulse shapes","ISI pulse shapes","dual-tone reference digital demodulator","mobile digital communication","intersymbol interference","pilot channel","data channel","bit error probability","pi /4-QPSK modulation","isotropic time-varying fading channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/211453/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1993","displayDocTitle":"A dual-tone reference digital demodulator for mobile digital communication","volume":"42","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1993","accessionNumber":"4443184","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dual-tone reference digital demodulator for mobile digital communication","sourcePdf":"00211453.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037512S","chronDate":"May 1993","isNumber":"5514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"14","articleId":"211453","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":211458,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Ju Chang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chung-Ju Chang","id":"37087143393"},{"name":"Chen-Hsiang Wu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chen-Hsiang Wu","id":"37087402407"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"211458","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":61},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=211458","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time division multiple access","Mobile communication","Simulated annealing","Throughput","Telecommunication traffic","Frequency division multiaccess","Multiaccess communication","Design methodology","Design optimization","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","data communication systems","simulated annealing","time division multiple access","voice communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voice slots","cellular radio","design","TDMA mobile communication system","simulated annealing algorithm","data slots","time-division multiple access","optimal relative position","combinatorial optimization problem","optimal frame pattern"]}],"doi":"10.1109/25.211458","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/5514/00211458.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"205","endPage":"211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.211458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal frame pattern design for a TDMA mobile communication system using a simulated annealing algorithm","abstract":"Different relative positions of voice and data slots within the frame of a TDMA (time-division multiple access) mobile communication system may result in different system data throughput. The design of the optimal relative position, namely the frame pattern which can achieve maximum data throughput, is described. This design method can be formulated as solving a combinatorial optimization problem. Generally, the global optimal solution of such a problem is hard to find using conventional methods, which may be computationally intractable. A reliable and effective method called a simulated annealing algorithm is applied to obtaining the global optimum. Numerical results reveal that there exist various optimal frame patterns for different ranges of traffic load and the optimal frame pattern can achieve great throughput improvement over a random frame pattern.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/211458/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4443189","volume":"42","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal frame pattern design for a TDMA mobile communication system using a simulated annealing algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal frame pattern design for a TDMA mobile communication system using a simulated annealing algorithm","sourcePdf":"00211458.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042653S","chronDate":"May 1993","isNumber":"5514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"14","articleId":"211458","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":211463,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The foci of attention are occluded regions, i.e., only the scene at the borders of the occlusions is modeled to compute the next move. Since the system has knowledge of the sensor geometry, it can resolve the appearance of occlusions by analyzing them. The problem of 3-D data acquisition is divided into two subproblems due to two types of occlusions. An occlusion arises either when the reflected laser light does not reach the camera or when the directed laser light does not reach the scene surface. After taking the range image of a scene, the regions of no data due to the first kind of occlusion are extracted. The missing data are acquired by rotating the sensor system in the scanning plane, which is defined by the first scan. After a complete image of the surface illuminated from the first scanning plane has been built, the regions of missing data due to the second kind of occlusions are located. Then, the directions of the next scanning planes for further 3-D data acquisition are computed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/211463/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1993","volume":"15","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1993","accessionNumber":"4443286","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Occlusions as a guide for planning the next view","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Occlusions as a guide for planning the next view","sourcePdf":"00211463.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037113S","chronDate":"May 1993","isNumber":"5515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"195","articleId":"211463","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":211474,"authors":[{"name":"H.A.

The complexity of the proposed algorithm is polynomial time, and it is O(n/sup 6/L) for matching graphs of size n. The developed algorithm is compared to two other algorithms.

Attention is focused on the conventional beamforming problem where the angular power spectrum is estimated, in this case by the adaptive minimum variance processor. The data to be processed are 200 Hz CW transmissions collected at sea by a 900 m vertical line array with 120 equally spaced sensors. Correlated multipath arrivals result in signal cancellation for the adaptive processor, and spatial smoothing techniques must be used prior to beamforming. The processing of subapertures is proposed. Full aperture and subaperture processing techniques are used on the 200 Hz data. Multipath arrivals are found to illuminate only parts of the array, thus indicating that the wavefield can be highly inhomogeneous with depth.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/48.211500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5517","startPage":"15","endPage":"24","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/48/5517/00211500.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial smoothing and minimum variance beamforming on data from large aperture vertical line arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/211500/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1993","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Spatial smoothing and minimum variance beamforming on data from large aperture vertical line arrays","publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","accessionNumber":"4409680","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"18","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial smoothing and minimum variance beamforming on data from large aperture vertical line arrays","sourcePdf":"00211500.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050256S","chronDate":"Jan 1993","isNumber":"5517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"4","articleId":"211500","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":211524,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The accuracy of this approach has been tested using a standard ECG library; a sensitivity of 99.38% and a positive predictivity of 99.48% have been achieved.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.212060","doi":"10.1109/10.212060","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5540/00212060.pdf","startPage":"201","endPage":"205","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An approach to QRS complex detection using mathematical morphology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An approach to QRS complex detection using mathematical morphology","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/212060/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1993","accessionNumber":"4447705","pubMedId":"8319971","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An approach to QRS complex detection using mathematical morphology","sourcePdf":"212060.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050412S","chronDate":"Feb.  1993","isNumber":"5540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"138","articleId":"212060","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":212067,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

The power spectrum is calculated from the AR coefficients derived from each single RR interval considered. Time-variant AR coefficients are determined through adaptive parametric identification with a forgetting factor which obtains weighted values on a running temporal window of 50 preceding measurements. Power spectrum density (PSD) is hence obtained at each cardiac cycle, making it possible to follow the dynamics of the spectral parameters on a beat-by-beat basis. These parameters are mainly the LF (low-frequency) and the HF (high-frequency) powers, and their ratio, LF/HF. These together account for the balanced sympatho-vagal control mechanism affecting the heart rate. This method is applied to subjects suffering from transient ischemic attacks. The time variant spectral parameters suggest an early activation of LF component in the HRV power spectrum. It precedes by approximately 1.5-2 min the tachycardia and the ST displacement, generally indicative of the onset of an ischemic episode.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.212067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5540","startPage":"136","endPage":"144","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5540/00212067.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-variant power spectrum analysis for the detection of transient episodes in HRV signal","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/212067/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1993","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Time-variant power spectrum analysis for the detection of transient episodes in HRV signal","publicationDate":"Feb. 1993","accessionNumber":"4447698","pubMedId":"8319964","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"40","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-variant power spectrum analysis for the detection of transient episodes in HRV signal","sourcePdf":"212067.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051774S","chronDate":"Feb.  1993","isNumber":"5540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"161","articleId":"212067","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":212242,"authors":[{"name":"L.

They were initially proposed by G. Ungerboeck (1982) using a convolutional code. Here, a block coding approach is given. Rate m/(m+1) coded 2/sup m+1/-ary phase-shift keying (PSK) is considered. The expanded signal-set is given the structure of a finite field. The code is defined by a square nonsingular circulant generator matrix over the field. Binary data are mapped on a dataword, of the same length as the codewords, over an additive subgroup of the field. The codes using trellises are described, and then the Viterbi algorithm for decoding is applied. The asymptotic coding gain ranges from 1.8 to 6.0 dB for QPSK going from blocklength 3 to 12. For 8-PSK, the gain is from 0.7 to 3.0 dB with blocklength 4 to 8. With only four states in the trellis, codes of any length for QPSK and 8-PSK are constructed, each having an asymptotic coding gain of 3.0 dB. Simulation results are presented.

The scheme allows a certain number of transitions from a second message to arrive before reception of the current message has been completed, a condition called skew. Necessary and sufficient conditions for codes that can detect skew as well as for codes that are skew-tolerant, i.e. can correct the skew and allow continuous operation, are derived. Codes that satisfy the necessary and sufficient conditions are constructed, their optimality is studied, and efficient decoding algorithms are devised.

At each time slot each queue may be connected to the server or not depending on the value of a binary random variable, the connectivity variable. Allocation at each slot; is based on the connectivity information and on the lengths of the connected queues only. At the end of each slot, service may be completed with a given fixed probability. Such a queueing model is appropriate for some communication networks with changing topology. In the case of infinite buffers, necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained for stabilizability of the system in terms of the different system parameters. The allocation policy that serves the longest connected queue stabilizes the system when the stabilizability conditions hold. The same policy minimizes the delay for the special case of symmetric queues. In a system with a single buffer per queue, an allocation policy is obtained that maximizes the throughput and minimizes the delay when the arrival and service statistics of different queues are identical.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.212277","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/5543/00212277.pdf","startPage":"466","endPage":"478","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.212277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic server allocation to parallel queues with randomly varying connectivity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=212277","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/212277/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic server allocation to parallel queues with randomly varying connectivity","volume":"39","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1993","accessionNumber":"4434434","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic server allocation to parallel queues with randomly varying connectivity","sourcePdf":"00212277.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021682S","chronDate":"Mar 1993","isNumber":"5543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"467","articleId":"212277","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":212280,"authors":[{"name":"O.

An iterative procedure is described for designing locally optimal direct sum codebooks. Both optimal and computationally efficient suboptimal encoding schemes are considered. It is shown that although an optimal encoding can be implemented by a sequential encoder, the complexity of implementing optimal stagewise partitions generally exceeds the complexity of an exhaustive search of the direct sum codebook. It is also shown that sequential nearest-neighbor encoders can be extremely inefficient.

Arbitrary (d,k)- and perfect (d,k)-codes capable of correcting single peak-shifts of given size t are defined. For the construction of perfect codes, a general combinatorial method connected with finding 'good' weight sequences in Abelian groups is used, and the concept of perfect t-shift N-designs is introduced. Explicit constructions of such designs for t=1, t=2, and t=(p-1)/2 are given, where p is a prime. This construction is universal in that it does not depend on the (d,k)-constraints. It also allows automatic correction of those peak-shifts that violate (d,k)-constraints. The construction is extended to (d,k)-codes of fixed binary length and allows the beginning of the next codeword to be determined.

Additionally, a statement was made that other IS techniques cannot be asymptotically efficient. It is shown that for the simulation of digital communication systems with Gaussian input, a broad class of asymptotically efficient IS techniques exists.

A distributed fairness mechanism for this architecture, which uses low latency hardware control signals, is presented. The basic fairness mechanism can be extended for implementing multiple priority levels and integration of asynchronous with synchronous traffic. The ring is full-duplex and has two basic modes of operation: buffer insertion mode for variable-size packets and slotted mode for fixed-size packets or cells. Concurrent access and spatial reuse allow simultaneous transmissions over disjoint segments of a bidirectional ring and can increase the effective throughput by a factor of four or more. The combination of a full-duplex ring, spatial reuse, a reliable fairness mechanism, and the exploitation of advent in fiber-optic technology are the basis for the MetaRing network architecture.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/212370/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1993","volume":"41","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","accessionNumber":"4439340","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"MetaRing-a full-duplex ring with fairness and spatial reuse","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MetaRing-a full-duplex ring with fairness and spatial reuse","sourcePdf":"00212370.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046013S","chronDate":"Jan 1993","isNumber":"5545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"141","articleId":"212370","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":212375,"authors":[{"name":"W.A.

The average operation cycle, for decoding each received word is just equal to the block length of the codeword. The decoder is constructed of three modules: the syndrome module, the comparison module, and the error corrector. Since all of the modules can be implemented by systolic circuits, the data rate of this decoder can theoretically be up to the rate of the inverse of two logic-gate delays operating from approximately several hundreds of megabits per second to the order of gigabits per second. Thus, the decoder can be applied in broadband service and video processing. By avoiding inverse operations in the step-by-step decoding method, the circuit complexity of the decoder can be made much less than that of the standard algebraic method. The detailed circuit diagrams of the comparison module and error corrector for double- and triple-error-correcting binary BCH codes are given for illustration.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/76.212719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.212719","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/5557/00212719.pdf","startPage":"138","endPage":"147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high-speed real-time binary BCH decoder","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","displayDocTitle":"A high-speed real-time binary BCH decoder","volume":"3","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1993","accessionNumber":"4440616","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/212719/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high-speed real-time binary BCH decoder","sourcePdf":"00212719.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021223S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"10","articleId":"212719","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":212720,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The algorithms are based on motion-field and pixel subsampling. A subsampled motion field is first determined by estimating the motion vectors for a fraction of the blocks. The motion vectors for these blocks are determined by using only a fraction of the pixels at any searched location and by alternating the pixel subsampling patterns with the searched locations. The subsampled motion field is then interpolated so that a motion vector is determined for each block of pixels. The algorithms are more robust than previously proposed fast algorithms and both can easily be combined with a hierarchical search strategy.

Specifically, Psi can approximately estimate the amplitude envelope of AM signals and the instantaneous frequency of FM signals. Bounds are derived for the approximation errors, which are negligible under general realistic conditions. These results, coupled with the simplicity of Psi , establish the usefulness of the energy operator for AM and FM signal demodulation. These ideas are then extended to a more general class of signals that are sine waves with a time-varying amplitude and frequency and thus contain both an AM and an FM component; for such signals it is shown that Psi can approximately track the product of their amplitude envelope and their instantaneous frequency. The theoretical analysis is done for both continuous- and discrete-time signals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.212729","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/5558/00212729.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.212729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5558","startPage":"1532","endPage":"1550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On amplitude and frequency demodulation using energy operators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=212729","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On amplitude and frequency demodulation using energy operators","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/212729/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1993","accessionNumber":"4440662","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On amplitude and frequency demodulation using energy operators","sourcePdf":"00212729.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033818S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"368","articleId":"212729","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":212730,"authors":[{"name":"Chimin Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chung Hua Polytechnic Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chimin Tsai","id":"37383428800"},{"name":"A.T.

Adding pole-zero cancellation pairs changes the scaling factor and the associated roundoff noise without affecting the transfer function. It is shown that with l/sub 2/ scaling, the upper bound of the noise reduction for direct form II IIR digital filters using K pole-zero cancellation pairs is about 6K dB. The authors consider parallel form 3P to be the basic structure, in which each subfilter is augmented with one or two pole-zero cancellation pairs and realized in direct form II. They seek an iterative optimization process for each subfilter to find the optimal pole-zero cancellation pairs that minimize the roundoff noise.

The design of the signal-dependent TFD is formulated in Cohen's class as an optimization problem and results in a special linear program. Given a signal to be analyzed, the solution to the linear program yields the optimal kernel and, hence, the optimal time-frequency mapping for that signal. A fast algorithm has been developed for solving the linear program, allowing the computation of the signal-dependent TFD with a time complexity on the same order as a fixed-kernel distribution. Besides this computational efficiency, an attractive feature of the optimization-based approach is the ease with which the formulation can be customized to incorporate application-specific knowledge into the design process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.212733","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/5558/00212733.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.212733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5558","startPage":"1589","endPage":"1602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A signal-dependent time-frequency representation: optimal kernel design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=212733","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A signal-dependent time-frequency representation: optimal kernel design","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/212733/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1993","accessionNumber":"4440666","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A signal-dependent time-frequency representation: optimal kernel design","sourcePdf":"00212733.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05494S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"215","articleId":"212733","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":212735,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimates are obtained by eigendecomposition of this composite covariance matrix using the narrowband MUSIC algorithm or its variants. Closed-form expressions for the asymptotic covariance matrix of the DOA estimation errors are derived using a perturbation analysis, evaluated for specific cases, and compared with the Cramer-Rao lower bound. Special attention is given to correlated and coherent signals.

It is shown that, under general assumptions, the number of numerically nonzero singular values can be used to determine the number of motions.

A relationship is derived between a good segmentation, the number of nonzero singular values in the input and the sum of the number of nonzero singular values in the segments. The approach is demonstrated on real and synthetic examples. The paper ends with a critical analysis of the approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/212809/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4353007","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 1991","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"Factorization-based segmentation of motions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Factorization-based segmentation of motions","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00212809.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05122S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct 1991","isNumber":"5559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"343","citationCount":"85","articleId":"212809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":212810,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Traditional approaches to this problem rely on an edge-based discontinuity model, and have problems with transparent phenomena. The authors introduce a layered model of scene segmentation based on explicitly representing the support of a homogeneous region. The model employs parallel robust estimation techniques, and uses a minimal-covering optimization to estimate the number of objects in the scene. Using a simple direct motion model of translating objects, they successfully segment real image sequences containing multiple motions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust estimation of a multi-layered motion representation","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE Workshop on Visual Motion","doi":"10.1109/WVM.1991.212810","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE Workshop on Visual Motion","pdfPath":"/iel2/343/5559/00212810.pdf","startPage":"173","endPage":"178","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WVM.1991.212810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5559","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=212810","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/212810/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct 1991","displayDocTitle":"Robust estimation of a multi-layered motion representation","conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4353006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust estimation of a multi-layered motion representation","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00212810.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042104S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct 1991","isNumber":"5559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"343","citationCount":"82","articleId":"212810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":212835,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The circuit operates from a+5 V power supply and is ideally suited for use as a general purpose cell in analogue and mixed signal ASIC design. The ADC operates in current mode and an accurate current sensing technique allows the comparators to operate very quickly even in the presence of small signal differences. The current mode approach has the advantage of small signal voltage swings, low node capacitance and therefore fast operation. The resolution of the converter is 8-bits as this will satisfy the requirements of many applications including digital mobile radio and disk drive servo control chips.

Recently, attention has been focused on detecting only d, not all, unidirectional errors, that is, d bits unidirectional error detecting (d-UED) codes. The paper shows a design method for a cost-effective self-testing checker for the optimal d-UED code. The checking policy is to check whether condition of the Borden code satisfies or not. The proposed checker includes the parallel weight counter, the comparator and the modulo adder in which new residue operation is defined and hence this makes the circuit self-testing. These circuits are designed to have all possible input patterns in order to satisfy self-testing property. Finally, the proposed checker has greatly reduced hardware requirements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Sept. 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/212948/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4341473","conferenceDate":"26-27 Sept. 1991","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A design method for cost-effective self-testing checker for optimal d-unidirectional error detecting codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A design method for cost-effective self-testing checker for optimal d-unidirectional error detecting codes","confLoc":"Kawasaki, Japan","sourcePdf":"00212948.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043866S","chronDate":"26-27 Sept. 1991","isNumber":"5561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"368","citationCount":"3","articleId":"212948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":213016,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The basis of the approach is the IDES (Intruder Detection Expert System) which has two components, an expert system looking for evidence of attacks on known vulnerabilities of the system and a statistical model of the behavior of a user on the computer system under surveillance. This model learns the habits a user has when he works with the computer, and raises warnings when the current behavior is not consistent with the previously learned patterns. The authors suggest the time series approach to add broader scope to the model. They therefore feel the need for alternative techniques and introduce the use of a neural network component for modeling user's behavior as a component for the intrusion detection system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/RISP.1992.213257","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1992 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on Research in Security and Privacy","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1992 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on Research in Security and Privacy","pdfPath":"/iel2/412/5566/00213257.pdf","startPage":"240","endPage":"250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RISP.1992.213257","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5566","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network component for an intrusion detection system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=213257","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/213257/","displayDocTitle":"A neural network component for an intrusion detection system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4319355","conferenceDate":"4-6 May 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network component for an intrusion detection system","confLoc":"Oakland, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00213257.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055913S","chronDate":"4-6 May 1992","isNumber":"5566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"412","citationCount":"209","articleId":"213257","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":213259,"authors":[{"name":"S.

First, the issue of correctness criteria that are weaker than one-copy serializability are explored. The requirements for a weaker correctness criterion are that it should preserve database consistency in some meaningful way, and moreover, it should be implementable in a way that does not require the scheduler to be trusted. Three different, increasingly stricter notions of serializability that can serve as substitutes for one-copy serializability are proposed. Second, a multiversion timestamping protocol is presented that has several very desirable properties: it is secure, produces multiversion histories that are equivalent to one-serial histories in which transactions are placed in a timestamp order, avoids livelocks, and can be implemented using single-level untrusted schedulers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5566","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1992 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on Research in Security and Privacy","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1992 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on Research in Security and Privacy","pdfPath":"/iel2/412/5566/00213259.pdf","doi":"10.1109/RISP.1992.213259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RISP.1992.213259","startPage":"216","endPage":"224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Alternative correctness criteria for concurrent execution of transactions in multilevel secure databases","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/213259/","displayDocTitle":"Alternative correctness criteria for concurrent execution of transactions in multilevel secure databases","conferenceDate":"4-6 May 1992","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4319353","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Alternative correctness criteria for concurrent execution of transactions in multilevel secure databases","confLoc":"Oakland, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00213259.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038683S","chronDate":"4-6 May 1992","isNumber":"5566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"412","citationCount":"15","articleId":"213259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":213269,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.

This paper proposes a new approach which can be applied to conventional transform coding without introducing additional information or significant blurring. It exploits the correlation between intensity values of boundary pixels of two neighboring blocks. Specifically, it is based on the theoretical and empirical observation that under mild assumptions, quantization of transform coefficients of two neighboring blocks increases the mean squared difference (MSD) between neighboring pixels on their boundaries by an amount dependent upon the width of quantization intervals of the transform coefficients. Therefore, among all permissible inverse quantized coefficients, the set which minimizes this MSD is most likely to reduce the blocking effect. To estimate the set of unquantized coefficients, a constrained quadratic programming problem is solved in which the quantization decision intervals provide upper and lower bound constraints on the coefficients. Computer simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed technique for the 256*256 image known as Lena.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/DCC.1991.213319","publicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings.

A wavelet transform (quadrature mirror filter pyramid) is used to decompose an image into bands containing information from different scales (spatial frequencies) and orientations.

The wavelet transform's various scale and orientation bands have a great deal of redundant, self-similar structure in the form of multi-modal conditional probabilities, so that linear predictors perform poorly. A simple histogram method is used to determine the multi-modal conditional probabilities between scales.

However, the authors propose an artificial neural net based scheme together with pattern classification algorithm for narrowband signal extraction. A three layer feedforward net is trained with three different algorithms namely backpropagation, Cauchy's algorithm with Boltzmann's probability distribution feature and the combined backpropagation-Cauchy's algorithm. A constrained tangent hyperbolic function is used to activate individual neurons. Computer simulation is carried out with inadequate data to reinforce the idea of the net's generalization capability. The robustness of the proposed scheme is claimed with the results obtained by making 25% links faulty between the layers. Performance comparison of the three algorithms is made and the superiority of the combined backpropagation-Cauchy's algorithm is established over the other two algorithms.

The approach is based on imbedding the various constraints in a generalized energy function, and then defining the network dynamics in such a way that the generalized energy function is a Lyapunov function of the artificial neural network. The novel feature of the proposed approach is that the nonlinear programming and the combinatorial optimization problems are solved simultaneously by one network.

The IEEE-30 bus test system was used to demonstrate that a feedforward neural network with back propagation can detect the state of the power system by monitoring line flows from SCADA data and then, make recommended corrective actions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ANN.1991.213477","startPage":"205","endPage":"209","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the First International Forum on Applications of Neural Networks to Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANN.1991.213477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5569","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the First International Forum on Applications of Neural Networks to Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/560/5569/00213477.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of power system emergency actions using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/213477/","displayDocTitle":"Identification of power system emergency actions using neural networks","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4353241","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 July 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jul 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of power system emergency actions using neural networks","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00213477.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056792S","chronDate":"23-26 Jul 1991","isNumber":"5569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"560","citationCount":"4","articleId":"213477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":213479,"authors":[{"name":"R.F.

The load is decomposed into a daily pattern reflecting the difference in activity level during the day, a weekly pattern representing the day-of-the week effect on load, a trend component concerning the seasonal growth and a weather component reflecting the deviations in load due to weather fluctuations. The performance of this network has been compared with some commonly used conventional smoothing methods, and stochastic methods in order to demonstrate the superiority of this approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ANN.1991.213489","pdfPath":"/iel2/560/5569/00213489.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"16","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the First International Forum on Applications of Neural Networks to Power Systems","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the First International Forum on Applications of Neural Networks to Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANN.1991.213489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5569","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short term forecasting using neural network approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/213489/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jul 1991","displayDocTitle":"Short term forecasting using neural network approach","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4353206","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"23-26 July 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short term forecasting using neural network approach","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00213489.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041421S","chronDate":"23-26 Jul 1991","isNumber":"5569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"560","citationCount":"4","articleId":"213489","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":213490,"authors":[{"name":"T.S.

The performance of the neural nets was disappointing with all but one of the other techniques outperforming them. Although the neural nets did not do well in this competition, this may be caused by a lack of forecasting experience by the neural net developers rather than limitations in the abilities of nets themselves.

A group of multi-layer perceptron type NN's are trained to classify the security status of the power system for specific contingencies based on the pre-contingency system variables. Curse of dimensionality of the input data is reduced by partitioning the problem into smaller sub-problems. Better class separation and further dimensionality reduction is obtained by a feature selection scheme based on Karhunen-Loe've expansion. When each trained NN is queried on-line, it can provide the power system operator with the security status of the current operating point for a specified contingency. The parallel network architecture and the adaptive capability of the NN's are combined to achieve high speeds of execution and good classification accuracy. With the expected emergence of affordable NN hardware, this technique has the potential to become a viable alternative to existing computationally intensive schemes for SSA.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ANN.1991.213498","startPage":"59","endPage":"64","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the First International Forum on Applications of Neural Networks to Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/560/5569/00213498.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the First International Forum on Applications of Neural Networks to Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANN.1991.213498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5569","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of Karhunen-Loe've expansion in training neural networks for static security assessment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Neural networks","Power system security","Power system analysis computing","Data security","Large-scale systems","Power system restoration","Automatic control","Computer architecture","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","power system analysis computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Karhunen-Loe've expansion","training","neural networks","static security assessment","power system","multi-layer perceptron"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/213498/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jul 1991","displayDocTitle":"Use of Karhunen-Loe've expansion in training neural networks for static security assessment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 July 1991","accessionNumber":"4353215","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of Karhunen-Loe've expansion in training neural networks for static security assessment","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00213498.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040198S","chronDate":"23-26 Jul 1991","isNumber":"5569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"560","citationCount":"15","articleId":"213498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":213499,"authors":[{"name":"A.B.

The purpose of the proposed control is to improve the damping effect of the system on electromechanical modes by reallocating load to generators. Since the neural network has flexible learning capability the authors apply it to identify the complex and nonlinear relation between the damping effect and the distribution of generating power. The trained neural network acts as the support system which aids an operator in performing the generating reallocation for enhancing the system stability. Furthermore, the authors develop a new type of neural network which can deal with the equal constraints about the output layer in the error-back-propagation type of neural network because it is important for the generating reallocation to satisfy the equal constraint about the energy balance between generation and load.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ANN.1991.213513","startPage":"149","endPage":"153","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the First International Forum on Applications of Neural Networks to Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANN.1991.213513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5569","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the First International Forum on Applications of Neural Networks to Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/560/5569/00213513.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based preventive control support system for power system stability enhancement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/213513/","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based preventive control support system for power system stability enhancement","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4353231","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 July 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jul 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based preventive control support system for power system stability enhancement","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00213513.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122908S","chronDate":"23-26 Jul 1991","isNumber":"5569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"560","articleId":"213513","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":213514,"authors":[{"name":"S.V.

The Co/sup 60/ gamma ray tests were performed on devices both biased and unbiased during irradiation and at two dose rates (1 krad/hr and 50 rad/hr). In all cases the biased devices showed a threshold voltage shift of approximately 0.09 V/krad and significant increases in surface dark current ( approximately 10nA/cm/sup 2//krad at 22 degrees C) which continued after irradiation had ceased. Both threshold voltage and dark current damage were reduced for unbiased devices. Power consumption, charge transfer efficiency (CTE), full well capacity and charge to voltage conversion factor were also measured but did not show large changes. Proton testing was carried out at 1.5 and 10 MeV again for biased and unbiased devices and dark current changes due to bulk damage were observed. These were bias independent. There was significant annealing of bulk damage after 3 months storage (this time the dark current reduced). After annealing a storage constant of roughly 2.4nA/cm/sup 2/ per MeV of damage energy at 22 degrees C was found.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"RADECS 91 First European Conference on Radiation and its Effects on Devices and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/597/5570/00213573.pdf","startPage":"368","endPage":"372","publicationTitle":"RADECS 91 First European Conference on Radiation and its Effects on Devices and Systems","doi":"10.1109/RADECS.1991.213573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADECS.1991.213573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5570","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=213573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radiation effects on CCDs for spaceborne acquisition and tracking applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiation effects","Dark current","Testing","Protons","Threshold voltage","Annealing","Performance evaluation","Energy consumption","Charge transfer","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace instrumentation","aerospace testing","annealing","CCD image sensors","gamma-ray effects","integrated circuit testing","proton effects","radiation hardening (electronics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiation testing","CCD image sensors","spaceborne acquisition","tracking","proton testing","gamma ray tests","biased devices","threshold voltage shift","surface dark current","dark current damage","unbiased devices","charge transfer efficiency","full well capacity","charge to voltage conversion factor","annealing of bulk damage"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/213573/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Sep 1991","displayDocTitle":"Radiation effects on CCDs for spaceborne acquisition and tracking applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4368746","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-12 Sept. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiation effects on CCDs for spaceborne acquisition and tracking applications","confLoc":"La Grande-Motte, France","sourcePdf":"00213573.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03275S","chronDate":"9-12 Sep 1991","isNumber":"5570","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"597","citationCount":"13","articleId":"213573","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":213610,"authors":[{"name":"G.C.

Most of the experimental data on semiconductors and semiconductor devices has been taken using high energy neutrons. Recent research has shown that this data can be extrapolated to other high energy radiation such as protons, electrons, alpha particles and gamma rays by normalizing to the energy going into atomic processes. Minority carrier lifetime is the most sensitive electronic property of silicon in the neutron environment. The degradation of minority carrier lifetime results in changes in semiconductor device properties such as current gain, storage time, saturation voltage and sink current. Carrier removal is the next most important characteristic of displacement damage and it causes a decrease in carrier mobility and an increase in resistivity. The dependence of these basic semiconductor properties on neutron fluence is introduced into device models such as SPICE and the resulting radiation inclusive model permits quantitative determination of device parameters as a function of neutron fluence.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/RADECS.1991.213610","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADECS.1991.213610","publicationTitle":"RADECS 91 First European Conference on Radiation and its Effects on Devices and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"RADECS 91 First European Conference on Radiation and its Effects on Devices and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/597/5570/00213610.pdf","startPage":"35","endPage":"40","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A summary review of displacement damage from high energy radiation in semiconductors and semiconductor devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/213610/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Sep 1991","displayDocTitle":"A summary review of displacement damage from high energy radiation in semiconductors and semiconductor devices","conferenceDate":"9-12 Sept. 1991","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4368708","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A summary review of displacement damage from high energy radiation in semiconductors and semiconductor devices","confLoc":"La Grande-Motte, France","sourcePdf":"00213610.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039102S","chronDate":"9-12 Sep 1991","isNumber":"5570","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"597","citationCount":"1","articleId":"213610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":213616,"authors":[{"name":"C.E.

In the case of pulsed inputs, time-dependent polarization is observed, leading to pulse breakup and a poorer switching contrast in nonlinear switching.

Since the frequency-domain radar echo consists of both small-scale natural resonances and large-scale scattering center information, the multiresolution property of the wavelet transform is well suited for analyzing such multiscale signals. Wavelet analysis examples of backscattered data from an open-ended waveguide cavity and a plasma cylinder are presented. Compared with the conventional short-time Fourier transform, the wavelet transform provides a more efficient representation of both the early-time scattering center data and the late-time resonances. The different scattering mechanisms are clearly resolved in the time-frequency representation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/214611/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1993","volume":"41","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4443065","publicationDate":"Feb. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet analysis of radar echo from finite-size targets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet analysis of radar echo from finite-size targets","sourcePdf":"00214611.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043342S","chronDate":"Feb 1993","isNumber":"5599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"75","articleId":"214611","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":214613,"authors":[{"name":"S.D.

While it is difficult to determine the dispersion and stability characteristics of these methods when applied on arbitrary grids, analysis of the idealized but representative case of a uniform skewed mesh proves to be quite tractable in 2-D. This analysis demonstrates that numerical dispersion errors are small for well-resolved spatial wavelengths and that these methods converge to the continuous-space solution in the limit as the cell and time step sizes vanish. Grid anisotropy (variations in wave propagation speed as a function of the propagation angle relative to the mesh coordinates) increases as the mesh is skewed. In spite of this, there exist some angles where waves propagate through the skewed mesh with virtually no dispersion. This analysis also provides a stability limit for the time step size in terms of geometrical mesh quantities.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/5599/00214617.pdf","startPage":"233","endPage":"235","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.214617","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.214617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5599","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=214617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Numerical dispersion and stability characteristics of time-domain methods on nonorthogonal meshes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Numerical stability","Time domain analysis","Finite difference methods","Stability analysis","Maxwell equations","Wavelength conversion","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Testing","Dispersion","Tiles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence of numerical methods","dispersion (wave)","electromagnetic wave propagation","finite difference time-domain analysis","Maxwell equations","mesh generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDTD method","electromagnetic propagation","stability characteristics","nonorthogonal meshes","finite-difference time-domain method","Maxwell's curl equations","nonorthogonal grids","uniform skewed mesh","numerical dispersion errors","continuous-space solution","wave propagation","propagation angle","time step size","geometrical mesh quantities"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/214617/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1993","displayDocTitle":"Numerical dispersion and stability characteristics of time-domain methods on nonorthogonal meshes","volume":"41","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1993","accessionNumber":"4443071","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Numerical dispersion and stability characteristics of time-domain methods on nonorthogonal meshes","sourcePdf":"00214617.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031259S","chronDate":"Feb 1993","isNumber":"5599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"20","articleId":"214617","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":214619,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

All the checkers are designed to be totally self-checking and hence the sorting array is highly reliable. Two-level pipelining is employed, making the design very efficient and suitable for real-time application.

Two major issues in the design of BTBs that achieves maximum performance with a limited number of bits allocated to the BTB implementation are discussed. The first is BTB management. A method for discarding branches from the BTB is examined. This method discards the branch with the smallest expected value for improving performance; it outperforms the least recently used (LRU) strategy by a small margin, at the cost of additional complexity. The second issue is the question of what information to store in the BTB. A BTB entry can consist of one or more of the following: branch tag, prediction information, the branch target address, and instructions at the branch target. Various BTB designs, with one or more of these fields, are evaluated and compared.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.214687","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/5602/00214687.pdf","startPage":"396","endPage":"412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.214687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Branch target buffer design and optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=214687","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/214687/","displayDocTitle":"Branch target buffer design and optimization","volume":"42","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1993","accessionNumber":"4452332","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Branch target buffer design and optimization","sourcePdf":"00214687.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051758S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"85","articleId":"214687","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":214688,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The procedure is based on a multiplication algorithm which generates the result with most significant digit first. Since the latency of such a multiplier is low, a reduced number of pipelining delays may be introduced in the reduction loop, resulting in a high sampling rate. The implementation obtained exhibits minimum hardware and ensures minimum latency. It is shown that its flexibility allows, on one hand, the ability to choose freely the number system radix and, on the other hand, the interleaving of two multiplier arrays into one. This is illustrated by the realization of a second-order all-pole filter, operating in a radix-4 representation and using only one array to perform two multiplications. In this way, long interconnections are avoided and denser and more regular layout is achieved. It turns out that the design procedure can also be applied successfully to various types of realization where multiplications are required.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.214688","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.214688","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/5602/00214688.pdf","startPage":"413","endPage":"426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systematic design of pipelined recursive filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/214688/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","displayDocTitle":"Systematic design of pipelined recursive filters","volume":"42","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1993","accessionNumber":"4452333","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systematic design of pipelined recursive filters","sourcePdf":"00214688.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040394S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"8","articleId":"214688","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":214690,"authors":[{"name":"G.R.

This interface is capable of correcting a single multibit symbol error or detecting the occurrence of two such errors. The device uses a shortened Reed-Solomon code, and two practical symbol sizes are considered; nibble (4-bit) errors are protected by a (40, 32) binary equivalent shortened code, and byte errors are covered by a (80, 64) binary-sized code. The Reed-Solomon codes have maximum protection levels, even when shortened, and allow simplifying the design options. A dual orthogonal basis used for the symbols' representations provides significant hardware savings. The interface unit achieves internal fault detection by comparing regenerated parity values in a totally self-checking equality checker. A fault-tolerant ultrareliable memory module is proposed and evaluated. An illustrative design is realized using a single desktop programmable gate array.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.214690","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/5602/00214690.pdf","startPage":"433","endPage":"446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.214690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multibit correcting data interface for fault-tolerant systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/214690/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","displayDocTitle":"Multibit correcting data interface for fault-tolerant systems","volume":"42","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1993","accessionNumber":"4452335","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multibit correcting data interface for fault-tolerant systems","sourcePdf":"00214690.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029068S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"8","articleId":"214690","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":214691,"authors":[{"name":"N.S.V.

Some components are equipped with alarms that ring in response to faulty conditions. In these systems, two types of problem are studies: fault diagnosis and alarm placement. The fault diagnosis problems deal with computing the set of all potential failure sources that correspond to a set of ringing alarms. Single faults, where exactly one component can become faulty at any time, are primarily considered. Systems are classified into zero-time and non-zero-time systems on the basis of fault propagation time. The latter are further classified on the basis of knowledge of propagation times. For each of these classes algorithms are presented for single fault diagnosis. The problem of detecting multiple faults is shown to be NP-complete.

The moment-preserving technique can be thought of as an information transformation method which groups the pixels of an image into classes. The variables in the so-called moment-preserving equations are determined iteratively by a recurrent neural network and a connectionist neural network which work cooperatively. Both of the networks are designed in such a way that the sum of square errors between the moments of the input image and those of the output version is minimized. The proposed neural network system is applied to automatic threshold selection. The experimental results show that the system can threshold images successfully. The performance of the method is compared with those of four other histogram-based multilevel threshold selection methods. The simulation results show that the proposed technique is at least as good as the other methods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.214696","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/5602/00214696.pdf","startPage":"501","endPage":"507","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.214696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network implementation of the moment-preserving technique and its application to thresholding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/214696/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","displayDocTitle":"A neural network implementation of the moment-preserving technique and its application to thresholding","volume":"42","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4452342","publicationDate":"April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network implementation of the moment-preserving technique and its application to thresholding","sourcePdf":"00214696.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10578S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"16","articleId":"214696","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":214705,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

In the KBCNN learning model, useful domain attributes and concepts are first identified and linked in a way consistent with initial domain knowledge, and then the links are weighted properly so as to maintain the semantics. Hidden units and additional connections may be introduced into this initial connectionist structure as appropriate. Then, this primitive structure evolves to minimize empirical error. The KBCNN learning model allows the theory learned or revised to be translated into the symbolic rule-based language that describes the initial theory. Thus, a domain theory can be pushed onto the network, revised empirically over time, and decoded in symbolic form. The domain of molecular genetics is used to demonstrate the validity of the KBCNN learning model and its superiority over related learning methods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.214775","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/5605/00214775.pdf","startPage":"173","endPage":"182","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.214775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5605","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Knowledge-based connectionism for revising domain theories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/214775/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1993","displayDocTitle":"Knowledge-based connectionism for revising domain theories","volume":"23","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4452403","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Knowledge-based connectionism for revising domain theories","sourcePdf":"00214775.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036808S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1993","isNumber":"5605","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"110","articleId":"214775","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-04"},{"_id":214776,"authors":[{"name":"R.V.

Using the critical tracking (CT) task, five subjects were tested at 10 degrees , 20 degrees , 40 degrees , 80 degrees , and 120 degrees FOV. The measured effective time delay declined exponentially as the FOV increased. The corresponding root-mean-squared (RMS) error followed a U-shaped curve with the majority of the RMS reduction at 40 degrees FOV. A second experiment, in which two subjects were tested at 10 degrees , 40 degrees , and 120 degrees FOV, used a time-invariant plant to allow the measurement of human describing-function parameters. The crossover frequency, increased at least 5% and the RMS error dropped by at least 20% at a FOV of 40 degrees or 120 degrees compared to 10 degrees . The results from these two experiments show that a FOV as small as 40 degrees can produce performance improvements of the same magnitude as a FOV as large as 120 degrees . In the final experiment, where only the central 10 degrees of the scene rotated, performance was unexpectedly best at 10 degrees and poorest at 40 degrees and 80 degrees .<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/214776/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1993","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1993","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4452404","volume":"23","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The effects of field of view size on the control of roll motion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effects of field of view size on the control of roll motion","sourcePdf":"00214776.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063951S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1993","isNumber":"5605","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"15","articleId":"214776","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":214777,"authors":[{"name":"V.J.

The characteristics of a neural network direct controller with a feedback control loop, which uses the learning results of the inverse transfer function identifier, is also proposed and confirmed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.214778","startPage":"204","endPage":"211","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/5605/00214778.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.214778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5605","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic system identification using neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System identification","Neural networks","Telecommunication control","Transfer functions","Control systems","Stability","Control theory","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Robot control","Design methodology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","identification","neural nets","nonlinear control systems","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","identification","direct transfer function","inverse transfer function","nonlinear plant simulator","second-order plant","direct controller","feedback control loop","learning results"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/214778/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1993","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic system identification using neural networks","volume":"23","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4452406","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic system identification using neural networks","sourcePdf":"00214778.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032291S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1993","isNumber":"5605","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"40","articleId":"214778","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":214779,"authors":[{"name":"Z.-B.

A numerical algorithm is developed for determining the optimal decision rule at each node assuming monotone cost functions imposed only on the root nodes. It is assumed that the observations of each node are conditionally independent of those of the other nodes. It is shown that the problem is equivalent to solving a nonlinear optimal control problem, and the necessary conditions of optimality using Bayes' risk as the optimization criterion are derived. The optimal control approach provides an interpretation of certain functions of the co-state variables in terms of thresholds, and leads to a computationally efficient min-H algorithm to solve for the optimal decision rule at each node. The numerical algorithm provides a tool to investigate the organizational issues of adaptation, structure, and robustness.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/214779/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1993","volume":"23","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4439323","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of detection networks.

A methodology is presented for accommodating the remaining unanticipated faults. For these two approaches, a tradeoff exists between the time to attain a solution to the reconfiguration problem and the generality of the approach. Unanticipated faults are represented as unmodeled forces and torques. Models of these forces and torques are developed online using a hybrid estimation/learning approach. The hybrid system is designed for fast estimation during the initial transient when a fault occurs, with continually improving performance as postfault information is accumulated by the learning system. Fault accommodation is achieved by a feedforward/feedback control architecture that employs an actuator distribution system to convert desired forces into individual actuator commands. This approach is demonstrated on a simulated autonomous vehicle, where the addition of a hybrid estimation/learning capability is shown to increase performance greatly over time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel1/5488303/5612/00214943.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"49","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00214943.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/37.214943","doi":"10.1109/37.214943","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=214943","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault detection","Logic","Control systems","System testing","Control system synthesis","Engines","Fault diagnosis","Electronic switching systems","Adaptive control","Sensor systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","identification","intelligent control","learning systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unmanned underwater vehicle","unanticipated faults","postfault dynamics","hybrid estimation/learning approach","learning system","feedforward/feedback control","actuator distribution system","actuator commands","autonomous vehicle"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/214943/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1993","displayDocTitle":"Using learning techniques to accommodate unanticipated faults","accessionNumber":"4468657","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1993","volume":"13","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using learning techniques to accommodate unanticipated faults","sourcePdf":"00214943.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073245S","chronDate":"June  1993","isNumber":"5612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"65","articleId":"214943","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":214946,"authors":[{"name":"G.J.

The method uses the direct intelligent control paradigm. The procedure is based on partitioning of the state space into small rectangles called cell groups, and quantization of the states and the available controls into finite levels or bins. Membership functions are then assigned for the state and controls. The transition from one conditional subspace to another is accomplished via a center-point mapping of the cell groups, under the applied action of each if-then rule. The systematic aspects of the procedure refer to the way transitional elements are clustered on the basis of an explicitly defined performance measure. Optimum transitions are selected using a search procedure. The fuzzy rules are generated automatically for transitioning from any initial cell group to the target cell group. A simplified engine model for idling speed control is used as the testbed for development and demonstration purposes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/37.214946","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","startPage":"62","endPage":"68","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/37.214946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5612","pdfPath":"/iel1/5488303/5612/00214946.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy logic","Automotive engineering","Engines","Control design","Control systems","Intelligent control","State-space methods","Quantization","Velocity control","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobiles","control system synthesis","fuzzy control","fuzzy logic","intelligent control","internal combustion engines","state-space methods","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["membership functions","automotive engine","systematic fuzzy logic control","intelligent control","state space","cell groups","quantization","if-then rule","search procedure","idling speed control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy logic control of an automotive engine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/214946/","volume":"13","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4468660","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy logic control of an automotive engine","sourcePdf":"00214946.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048812S","chronDate":"June  1993","isNumber":"5612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"62","articleId":"214946","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":215001,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Circuits are characterized in terms of graphs, logic functions and don't care conditions induced by the external and internal interconnections. The replacement of a gate in a synchronous logic network is modeled by a perturbation of the corresponding logic function, and it is shown that the don't care conditions for the gate optimization represent the bound on this perturbation.

It is shown that all such filters can be designed starting from an appropriate one-dimensional prototype filter and performing a simple transformation. With D denoting the number of dimensions, the complexity of design and implementation of the M-D filter are reduced from O(N/sup D/) to O(N). Using the polyphase technique, an implementation with complexity of only 2N is obtained in the two-dimensional. Even though the filters designed are in general nonseparable, they have separable polyphase components. One special application of this method is in M-D multirate signal processing, where filters with parallelepiped-shaped passbands are used in decimation, interpolation, and filter banks. Some generalizations and other applications of this approach, including M-D uniform discrete Fourier transform (DFT) quadrature mirror filter banks that achieve perfect reconstruction, are studied.

They propose using cyclotomic polynomial building blocks to form a multiplierless prefilter with impressive stopband performance, and they provide a straightforward strategy for choosing the polynomials to match filter specification. Two options for design of the equalizer are provided. A uniformly spaced equalizer can be optimally (L/sub infinity /) designed via a modified Parks-McClellan algorithm. A new algorithm, based on complex basis function subset selection methods, is also proposed for optimal design of a more efficient, nonuniformly spaced equalizer. The techniques, which can be applied to a broad class of filter design problems, typically provide a 35%-85% reduction in the number of additions and multiplications required, with a cost of 10%-45% additional delays.

The hardware complexity of the pipelined filters is the same as for the sequential filter and is independent of the level of pipelining or speedup. Two pipelined architectures along with their convergence analyses are presented to illustrate the tradeoff offered by relaxed look-ahead.

The combined effects of both deterministic and statistical parameters must be incorporated. The statistical characteristics of the common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) and the offset of two-stage CMOS op-amps are investigated. The op-amp errors associated with finite open-loop gains, finite CMRRs, and nonzero offset voltages are analyzed. It is shown that the random common-mode gain as determined by the mismatch of paired devices is comparable to the deterministic common-mode gain. It is shown that the probability density function of the CMRR is distributed similarly to that of a Gaussian random variable, but the mean is finite and the symmetry is skewed somewhat, as contrasted with the probability density function of the offset voltage which has a Gaussian distribution with zero mean. It is also shown that a nonideal finite CMRR can actually reduce the op-amp errors caused by a finite open-loop gain.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/215338/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1993","volume":"40","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4453821","publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Nonideality consideration for high-precision amplifiers-analysis of random common-mode rejection ratio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonideality consideration for high-precision amplifiers-analysis of random common-mode rejection ratio","sourcePdf":"00215338.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047209S","chronDate":"Jan 1993","isNumber":"5627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"12","articleId":"215338","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":215342,"authors":[{"name":"C.

For the input signal, the output is calculated by a nonlinear feedback loop. The quantizer characteristics can be taken as continuous in the feedforward path. The quantizer exhibits a saturation level and has a linear part with a variable slope greater than 1. In the feedback path, the linear filter R is recursive. The stability of R is sufficient to ensure the stability of the DPCM system. The case of an order-1 predictor has been investigated previously. In this work, the stability of an order-t predictor is considered. The main result is that the stability of R is not necessary. In the second-order case, the shape of the stability domain in terms of the prediction coefficients is investigated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/81.215342","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00215342.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/5627/00215342.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5627","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.215342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability of a DPCM transmission system with an order t predictor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/215342/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1993","displayDocTitle":"Stability of a DPCM transmission system with an order t predictor","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","accessionNumber":"4453826","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability of a DPCM transmission system with an order t predictor","sourcePdf":"00215342.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033468S","chronDate":"Jan 1993","isNumber":"5627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","articleId":"215342","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":215343,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This analysis is based on the state-plane approach that has been successfully used to obtain the steady-state response for resonant converters. Applying perturbation directly to the steady-state trajectory, a discrete small-signal model for the converter can be derived in terms of the input voltage, switching frequency, and the converter state variables. Furthermore, this method can be applied to resonant converters in general, regardless of the order of their resonant tanks. Based on the derived closed-form solution, the frequency responses of input-to-output and control-to-output transfer functions are obtained.

The lack of spectral content causes a large eigenvalue spread of the data correlation matrix, with deleterious effects on the performance of conventional adaptive algorithms. An adaptive decision-feedback equalizer update algorithm that does not have these undesirable properties is presented. The algorithm calculates an iterative regularized inverse solution for the decision-feedback equalizer coefficients and applies appropriate attenuation (regularization) at frequencies lacking signal energy. This automatic estimation of the significant signal components provides an improvement over other methods that use matrix arithmetic to perform the same task. The other features of the algorithm are linear computational complexity and fast tracking capability. Simulation results that compare the algorithm to the conventional LMS and RLS algorithms are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/82.215355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.215355","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/5628/00215355.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive algorithm for stable decision-feedback filtering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1993","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive algorithm for stable decision-feedback filtering","publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"40","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4457975","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/215355/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive algorithm for stable decision-feedback filtering","sourcePdf":"00215355.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038257S","chronDate":"Jan 1993","isNumber":"5628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"13","articleId":"215355","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":215359,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Hardware complexity is similar to that of frequency sampling structures, but unlike them, the filter bank has much better behavior under finite-precision arithmetic; it remains stable under coefficient truncation, and also does not sustain limit cycles if magnitude truncation is applied. The linear complexity, modularity, and good finite-precision behavior of the structure make it extremely suitable for implementation using VLSI circuits or digital signal processors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/215359/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1993","volume":"40","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4457979","publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Filter banks for time-recursive implementation of transforms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Filter banks for time-recursive implementation of transforms","sourcePdf":"00215359.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046219S","chronDate":"Jan 1993","isNumber":"5628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"14","articleId":"215359","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":215360,"authors":[{"name":"P.A.

Here the authors correlate the higher n-well Q/sub bd/ to smooth capacitor oxide/substrate interfaces and minimized grain boundary cusps at the poly-Si gate/oxide interfaces, confirming that Fowler-Nordheim tunneling is the dominant current conduction mechanisms through the oxide. They correlate higher Q/sub bd/ to higher barrier height for a given substrate type and observe that the slope of the barrier height versus temperature plot is lower for both p-well and n-well cases with electrons tunneling from the silicon substrate. This is attributed to surface roughness at the poly-Si gate/SiO/sub 2/ interface. A poly-Si gate deposition and annealing process with clean, smooth oxide/substrate interfaces will improve the p-well breakdown characteristics and allow higher Q/sub bd/ to be achieved.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.216429","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/5658/00216429.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.216429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5658","startPage":"1251","endPage":"1257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Q/sub bd/ for electrons tunneling from the Si/SiO/sub 2/ interface compared to electron tunneling from the poly-Si/SiO/sub 2/ interface","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=216429","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Q/sub bd/ for electrons tunneling from the Si/SiO/sub 2/ interface compared to electron tunneling from the poly-Si/SiO/sub 2/ interface","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/216429/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1993","accessionNumber":"4475571","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Q/sub bd/ for electrons tunneling from the Si/SiO/sub 2/ interface compared to electron tunneling from the poly-Si/SiO/sub 2/ interface","sourcePdf":"00216429.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044981S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"5658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"35","articleId":"216429","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":216439,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The matching conditions for the resistive three-port are modeled by scattering matrices. As transmission lines of unequal length are used, the network transfer functions are derived for three different delay variables. These functions are obtained in a matrix form after their expansions with respect to these variables are derived, so that output waveforms can be calculated from the network transfer functions or their expansions. Three characteristics of output waveforms are discussed. Ideal networks that furnish the same output waveforms as their inputs and practical networks that have parameters as close as possible to the ideal are described. Examples of networks that keep the ringing of output waveforms within given tolerances, from the first arriving wave to the steady state, are presented.

A technique for optimizing the ABCs that results in a return loss from a wideband pulse less than -50 dB is demonstrated. This technique reduces the risk of loss of accuracy due to mode conversion at the boundary. The use of these optimized ABCs considerably improves analysis results for an important category of microstrip components. For boundaries transverse to the direction of propagation, it is shown that inaccuracy and late time instability can result if the boundary is placed in regions of high field strength.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/5659/00216470.pdf","startPage":"290","endPage":"297","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.216470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.216470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5659","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=216470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized absorbing boundary conditions for the analysis of planar circuits using the finite difference time domain method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Boundary conditions","Circuit analysis","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Microwave circuits","Optimization methods","Availability","Microwave theory and techniques","Partial differential equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["boundary-value problems","finite difference time-domain analysis","microstrip components","microwave circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["absorbing boundary conditions","planar circuits","finite difference time domain method","planar waveguide termination","return loss","wideband pulse","microstrip components","late time instability","high field strength"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/216470/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1993","displayDocTitle":"Optimized absorbing boundary conditions for the analysis of planar circuits using the finite difference time domain method","volume":"41","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1993","accessionNumber":"4472439","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized absorbing boundary conditions for the analysis of planar circuits using the finite difference time domain method","sourcePdf":"00216470.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03541S","chronDate":"Feb 1993","isNumber":"5659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"25","articleId":"216470","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":216473,"authors":[{"name":"W.K.

Yarman's (RCA Rev., vol.43, p.529-41, Sept. 1982) simplified real frequency technique is modified and used to design a stability-guaranteed broadband microwave amplifier consisting of a potentially unstable transistor. The source and load terminations can be complex impedances. The stability is maintained by the conductances resulted from transforming the source and load terminations through the input and output matching circuits. The input and output matching circuits are derived concurrently, instead of sequentially. Repeating the design of an example from a previous paper shows that the transducer gain obtained by using this method is higher, with fewer matching circuit elements, than that obtained by using supercompact optimizers. Moreover, with the same number of matching circuit elements, the transducer gain is slightly higher than that obtained by using the dynamic CAD technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.216477","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00216477.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/5659/00216477.pdf","startPage":"336","endPage":"340","doi":"10.1109/22.216477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stable broadband microwave amplifier design using the simplified real frequency technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1993","displayDocTitle":"Stable broadband microwave amplifier design using the simplified real frequency technique","volume":"41","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1993","accessionNumber":"4472445","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/216477/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stable broadband microwave amplifier design using the simplified real frequency technique","sourcePdf":"00216477.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027698S","chronDate":"Feb 1993","isNumber":"5659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"14","articleId":"216477","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":216482,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The method, referred to as decision feedback sequence estimation (DFSE), is based on a conventional Viterbi algorithm (VA) using a reduced-state trellis combined with decision feedback (DF). By varying the number of states in the VA, the receiver structure can be changed gradually from a DF receiver to the optimal maximum-likelihood sequence estimator (MLSE). In this way different tradeoffs between performance and complexity can be obtained. Results on the receiver performance, based on minimum distance calculations and bit error rate simulations, are given for Gaussian minimum-shift keying modulation on typical mobile radio channels. It is shown that for channels with a long memory, a significant complexity reduction can be achieved at the cost of a moderate degradation in performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.216498","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/5660/00216498.pdf","startPage":"280","endPage":"284","doi":"10.1109/26.216498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decision feedback sequence estimation for continuous phase modulation on a linear multipath channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1993","displayDocTitle":"Decision feedback sequence estimation for continuous phase modulation on a linear multipath channel","volume":"41","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1993","accessionNumber":"4475641","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/216498/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decision feedback sequence estimation for continuous phase modulation on a linear multipath channel","sourcePdf":"00216498.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046303S","chronDate":"Feb 1993","isNumber":"5660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"14","articleId":"216498","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":216499,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The converter has the advantage of using a minimum possible number of semiconductor devices in the power circuit without the attendant need for a bifilar winding, so that its drive requirements are minimal and the windings are simple. This is achieved by eliminating the additional semiconductor switch(es) normally required for regeneration. Energy stored in the phase windings during conduction time is partially dissipated in a resistor, whereas the rest is converted to mechanical power. A complete steady-state analysis of the drive including the input filter parameters is given. Closed-form expressions for determining the current and voltage stresses on the semiconductor devices are derived, and they are cast in normalized form for use in selecting the ratings of the power devices. Experimental verification of the key results is provided for a 6/4-pole SRM drive system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/28.216539","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00216539.png","startPage":"320","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/5661/00216539.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.216539","endPage":"327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and design of a low-cost converter for switched reluctance motor drives","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/216539/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 1993","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and design of a low-cost converter for switched reluctance motor drives","volume":"29","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4452436","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March-April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and design of a low-cost converter for switched reluctance motor drives","sourcePdf":"00216539.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034738S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 1993","isNumber":"5661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"35","articleId":"216539","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":216541,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Methods for correction and/or elimination of these sources are reviewed, so that users can better understand how these voltages and currents are generated.

An affine nonrigid motion model is set up. The specific knowledge about facial shape and facial expression is formulated in this model in the form of parameters. A direct method of estimating the two-view motion parameters that is based on the affine method is discussed. Based on the reasonable assumption that the 3-D motion of the face is almost smooth in the time domain, several approaches to predicting the motion of the next frame are proposed. Using a 3-D model, the approach is characterized by a feedback loop connecting computer vision and computer graphics. Embedding the synthesis techniques into the analysis phase greatly improves the performance of motion estimation. Simulations with long image sequences of real-world scenes indicate that the method not only greatly reduces computational complexity but also substantially improves estimation accuracy.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00216724.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/5674/00216724.pdf","startPage":"545","endPage":"555","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.216724","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.216724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5674","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=216724","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-D motion estimation in model-based facial image coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Image coding","Head","Shape","Face detection","Feedback loop","Joining processes","Computer vision","Computer graphics","Image motion analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","motion estimation","parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter estimation","3-D motion estimation","model-based facial image coding","affine nonrigid motion model","facial shape","facial expression","two-view motion parameters","computer vision","computer graphics","synthesis techniques","computational complexity","estimation accuracy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/216724/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1993","displayDocTitle":"3-D motion estimation in model-based facial image coding","volume":"15","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1993","accessionNumber":"4465220","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-D motion estimation in model-based facial image coding","sourcePdf":"00216724.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03833S","chronDate":"Jun 1993","isNumber":"5674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"223","articleId":"216724","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":216726,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The framework features dynamic models that incorporate the mechanical principles of rigid and nonrigid bodies into conventional geometric primitives. Through the efficient numerical simulation of Lagrange equations of motion, the models can synthesize physically correct behaviors in response to applied forces and imposed constraints. Applying continuous Kalman filtering theory, a recursive shape and motion estimator that employs the Lagrange equations as a system model is developed. The system model continually synthesizes nonrigid motion in response to generalized forces that arise from the inconsistency between the incoming observations and the estimated model state. The observation forces also account formally for instantaneous uncertainties and incomplete information. A Riccati procedure updates a covariance matrix that transforms the forces in accordance with the system dynamics and prior observation history. Experiments involving model fitting and tracking of articulated and flexible objects from noisy 3-D data are described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.216727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.216727","endPage":"591","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/5674/00216727.pdf","startPage":"580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shape and nonrigid motion estimation through physics-based synthesis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/216727/","displayDocTitle":"Shape and nonrigid motion estimation through physics-based synthesis","volume":"15","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"4465223","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shape and nonrigid motion estimation through physics-based synthesis","sourcePdf":"00216727.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056932S","chronDate":"Jun 1993","isNumber":"5674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"273","articleId":"216727","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":216733,"authors":[{"name":"F.

A method for the determination of the mutual admittance between the grating electrodes is presented, and an analytical expression for the contribution of surface acoustic waves (SAWs) is proposed. The SAW characteristic parameters are determined with a numerical technique that is able to deal with a leaky SAW as well as a true SAW (conventional Rayleigh type or Bleustein-Gulyaev type). Using this technique, the SAWs' contribution to the mutual admittance can be removed, and the analysis of other contributions becomes possible.

Case studies that reveal several important issues regarding the impacts EV load may have on utility distribution systems are examined. First, it is not adequate to have only sufficient generation capacity during off-peak hours to assure a system's ability to absorb EV loads without adverse effects. The constraints at the distribution level must be properly studied. Second, a sizable EV load can introduce a new peak in the early off-peak period. This may have scheduling implications and can completely throw any load management programs off balance. Third, at the present state of EV technology, including that of battery modules and chargers, a typical distribution system may not be able to supply EV loads beyond 20% penetration level. This constraint is created by the long (up to 12 hours) charging cycle of batteries.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.216865","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/5679/00216865.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.216865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5679","startPage":"591","endPage":"597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An investigation into the impact of electric vehicle load on the electric utility distribution system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=216865","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An investigation into the impact of electric vehicle load on the electric utility distribution system","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/216865/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1993","accessionNumber":"4461453","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An investigation into the impact of electric vehicle load on the electric utility distribution system","sourcePdf":"00216865.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040138S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"186","articleId":"216865","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":216866,"authors":[{"name":"P.S.

The impact of the constraints imposed by the HVDC equations is analyzed, and it is determined when the implicit reactive power modulation resulting from constant gamma control may be detrimental for the damping.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5679","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.216868","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/5679/00216868.pdf","startPage":"620","endPage":"627","doi":"10.1109/61.216868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Utilizing HVDC to damp power oscillations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","displayDocTitle":"Utilizing HVDC to damp power oscillations","volume":"8","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1993","accessionNumber":"4461456","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/216868/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utilizing HVDC to damp power oscillations","sourcePdf":"00216868.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023093S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"90","articleId":"216868","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":216874,"authors":[{"name":"V.E.

Recently, a new adaptive learning approach involving neural networks has been applied to the modeling of polysilicon film growth by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). In this paper, neural network modeling is applied to the removal of polysilicon films by plasma etching. The plasma etch process under investigation was previously modeled using the empirical response surface approach. However, in comparing neural network methods with the statistical techniques, it is shown that the neural network models exhibit superior accuracy and require fewer training experiments. Furthermore, the results of this study indicate that the predictive capabilities of the neural models are superior to that of their statistical counterparts for the same experimental data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel3/66/5682/00216928.pdf","startPage":"103","endPage":"111","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","doi":"10.1109/66.216928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/66.216928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5682","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=216928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advantages of plasma etch modeling using neural networks over statistical techniques","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Plasma applications","Etching","Neural networks","Semiconductor process modeling","Plasma sheaths","Plasma simulation","Plasma chemistry","Response surface methodology","Equations","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic engineering computing","elemental semiconductors","neural nets","semiconductor process modelling","semiconductor thin films","silicon","sputter etching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["plasma etch modeling","neural networks","statistical techniques","integrated circuit fabrication step","adaptive learning","polysilicon films","polycrystalline Si removal"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/216928/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1993","displayDocTitle":"Advantages of plasma etch modeling using neural networks over statistical techniques","volume":"6","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1993","accessionNumber":"4491368","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advantages of plasma etch modeling using neural networks over statistical techniques","sourcePdf":"00216928.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036845S","chronDate":"May 1993","isNumber":"5682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"160","articleId":"216928","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":217179,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Size and real-time considerations show that on-chip learning is necessary for a large range of applications. A flexible digital design is preferred here to more compact analog or optical realizations. As opposed to many current implementations, the two-dimensional systolic array system presented is an attempt to define a novel computer architecture inspired by neurobiology. It is composed of generic building blocks for basic operations rather than predefined neural models. A full custom VLSI design of a first prototype has demonstrated the efficacy of this design. A complete board dedicated to Hopfield's model has been designed using these building blocks. Beyond the very specific application presented, the underlying principles can be used for designing efficient hardware for most neural network models.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/5697/00217181.pdf","startPage":"400","endPage":"407","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/72.217181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.217181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5697","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=217181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A generic systolic array building block for neural networks with on-chip learning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Systolic arrays","Neural networks","Network-on-a-chip","Artificial neural networks","Computer architecture","Signal processing algorithms","Prototypes","Neural network hardware","Biological system modeling","System-on-a-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hopfield neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural chips","systolic arrays","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["systolic array building block","neural networks","on-chip learning","VLSI implementations","computer architecture","neurobiology","Hopfield's model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/217181/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1993","displayDocTitle":"A generic systolic array building block for neural networks with on-chip learning","volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1993","accessionNumber":"4461931","pubMedId":"18267742","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A generic systolic array building block for neural networks with on-chip learning","sourcePdf":"00217181.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043212S","chronDate":"May  1993","isNumber":"5697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"42","articleId":"217181","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":217182,"authors":[{"name":"T.G.

Experimental results demonstrate that the network produces linearly separable outputs that correspond to dominant features of the inputs. Such representations allow for efficient additional neural processing. Part of the adaptation rule also includes a small number of fixed inputs and a variable lateral inhibition mechanism.

The output neuron consists of a linear current-to-voltage converter and a sigmoid function generator with a controllable voltage gain. Network training is performed by the modified Kalman neuro-filtering algorithm to speed up the convergence process for intersymbol interference and white Gaussian noise communication channels.

The chip motion computation uses unidirectional delay lines as tuned filters for moving edges. Photoreceptors detect local changes in image intensity, and the outputs from these photoreceptors are coupled into the delay line, where they propagate with a particular speed in one direction. If the velocity of the moving edges matches that of the delay line, then the signal on the delay line is reinforced. The output of each pixel is the power in the delay line signal, computed within each pixel. This power computation provides the essential nonlinearity for velocity selectivity. The delay line architecture differs from the usual pairwise correlation models in that motion information is aggregated over an extended spatiotemporal range. As a result, the detectors are sensitive to motion over a wide range of spatial frequencies. The design of functional one- and two-dimensional silicon retinas with direction-selective, velocity-tuned pixels is described. It is shown that pixels with three hexagonal directions of motion selectivity are approximately (225 mu m)/sup 2/ in area in a 2- mu m CMOS technology and consume less than 5 mu W of power.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.217194","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","startPage":"529","endPage":"541","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/5697/00217194.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.217194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5697","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Silicon retina with correlation-based, velocity-tuned pixels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Retina","Delay lines","Image edge detection","Photoreceptors","CMOS technology","Filters","Computer architecture","Pairwise error probability","Spatiotemporal phenomena"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue processing circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","delay lines","motion estimation","neural chips","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["photoreceptors","velocity-tuned pixels","two-dimensional silicon retina","local direction-selective outputs","chip motion computation","unidirectional delay lines","tuned filters","moving edges","image intensity","delay line signal","velocity selectivity","spatiotemporal range","hexagonal directions","2 micron","5 muW"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1993","displayDocTitle":"Silicon retina with correlation-based, velocity-tuned pixels","volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4461944","pubMedId":"18267755","publicationDate":"May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/217194/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Silicon retina with correlation-based, velocity-tuned pixels","sourcePdf":"00217194.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03912S","chronDate":"May  1993","isNumber":"5697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"127","articleId":"217194","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":217204,"authors":[{"name":"S.

An approach to image restoration that recovers image detail using a constrained optimization theoretic approach is introduced. Ideal star images may be modeled as a few point sources in a uniform background.

A sparseness criterion based on the l/sub p/ is presented, and candidate algorithms for solving the ensuing nonlinear constrained optimization problem are presented and reviewed.

However, the physical PSF models do not always result in a significantly better restoration, due to the coarse sampling of the recording device and insufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. Low recording resolutions result in aliasing errors in the PSF and suboptimal restorations. A high-resolution representation of the PSF where aliasing errors are minimized is used to obtain improved restorations. The SNR is the parameter which ultimately limits the restoration quality and determines the need for an accurate PSF model. As a rule of thumb, the geometrical PSF can be used in place of the physical PSF without significant loss in restoration quality when the SNR is less than 30 dB.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.217229","startPage":"252","endPage":"259","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/5699/00217229.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.217229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5699","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the accuracy of PSF representation in image restoration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image restoration","Signal restoration","Solid modeling","Optical recording","Physical optics","Geometrical optics","Image sampling","Signal to noise ratio","Signal resolution","Thumb"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometrical optics","image reconstruction","physical optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PSF models","point spread function","image quality","image restoration","physical optics","geometrical optics","recording device","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","aliasing errors","restoration quality"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/217229/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1993","displayDocTitle":"On the accuracy of PSF representation in image restoration","volume":"2","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4453816","pubMedId":"18296213","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the accuracy of PSF representation in image restoration","sourcePdf":"00217229.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027809S","chronDate":"April  1993","isNumber":"5699","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"35","articleId":"217229","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":217467,"authors":[{"name":"Min-Sheng Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Min-Sheng Lin","id":"37087285383"},{"name":"Deng-Jyi Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Deng-Jyi Chen","id":"37087282988"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-2755-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"217467","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distributed control","Computer network reliability","Distributed computing","Reliability theory","Network topology","Computer networks","Computer science","Reliability engineering","Concurrent computing","Fault tolerant systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","software reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed program reliability","distributed computing systems","FREA","fast reliability evaluation algorithm","generalized factoring theorem","file distributions","program distributions","ARPA network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=217467","abstract":"This paper presents an algorithm for computing the distributed program reliability in distributed computing systems (DCS).

In this receiver an interdigitated GaAs metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) photodetector is combined with a transimpedance preamplifier fabricated in silicon bipolar technology. The measured dark current of the GaAs/Si photodetector is 7 nA. The measured pulse response of an experimental integrated receiver is less than 550 ps FWHM.

Its spectral efficiency is compared with that of Gaussian minimum-shift keying (GMSK) using adjacent channel interference (ACI) as a parameter. It is established that in a noncellular environment, hardlimited F-QPSK has a spectral efficiency of 1.42 b/s/Hz, which is up to 51% more spectrally efficient than GMSK BT=0.5 for ACI=20 dB. F-QPSK's BER performance in AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels is shown to be superior to that of GMSK. The spectral efficiency of the modulations in cellular/microcellular environments where frequency is reused in geographically separate cells to achieve higher capacity is compared. It is shown that the application of F-QPSK in such environment would leads to a 95% increase of system capacity compared to GMSK. It is concluded that the power and spectrally efficient F-QPSK make it an excellent candidate for future high-capacity personal communication system (PCS) networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/11.218001","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","startPage":"288","endPage":"294","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel1/11/5720/00218001.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.218001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"F-QPSK-a superior modulation technique for mobile and personal communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Personal communication networks","Interchannel interference","Bit error rate","Frequency","Fading","Mobile communication","Australia","Phase modulation","Intersymbol interference","Jitter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","mobile radio systems","personal communication networks","phase shift keying","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio","cellular radio","microcellular radio","bit error rate performance","additive white Gaussian noise","F-QPSK","modulation technique","personal communications","quadrature phase shift keying","spectral efficiency","adjacent channel interference","noncellular environment","AWGN","Rayleigh fading channels","system capacity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1993","displayDocTitle":"F-QPSK-a superior modulation technique for mobile and personal communications","volume":"39","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4469394","publicationDate":"June 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/218001/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"F-QPSK-a superior modulation technique for mobile and personal communications","sourcePdf":"00218001.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074743S","chronDate":"Jun 1993","isNumber":"5720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"37","articleId":"218001","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":218003,"authors":[{"name":"C.S.

The other results in a uniform filter bank containing shifted versions of same filters. This, in turn, introduces dependencies in design, and is left for future work.

Several simulation examples demonstrating the good properties of the adaptive filters as well as verifying the analytical results are also presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/5728/00218137.pdf","startPage":"2075","endPage":"2087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A stochastic gradient adaptive filter with gradient adaptive step size","doi":"10.1109/78.218137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5728","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.218137","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=218137","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/218137/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1993","displayDocTitle":"A stochastic gradient adaptive filter with gradient adaptive step size","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1993","accessionNumber":"4477072","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"41","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A stochastic gradient adaptive filter with gradient adaptive step size","sourcePdf":"00218137.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032933S","chronDate":"Jun 1993","isNumber":"5728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"272","articleId":"218137","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":218138,"authors":[{"name":"A.P.

The reconstruction employs data collected by two receivers placed well apart from each other. Each received sequence consists of the convolution of the transmitted signal with a channel. Applying the bicepstrum iterative reconstruction algorithm on the differences of the cepstra coefficients of the two received sequences, the cepstra coefficients of the transmission channels can be computed and used for the reconstruction of the transmitted signal. The deconvolution can be performed even if the data sequences are corrupted by additive noise. The computation of the cepstra coefficients is based on the cross-bispectrum if the noise processes present in the observation sequences are zero mean and uncorrelated, while the bicepstrum of each observation is used if the noise processes are zero mean correlated with a symmetric probability density function.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.218138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5728","startPage":"2088","endPage":"2095","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/5728/00218138.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.218138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind convolution using signal reconstruction from partial higher order cepstral information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Signal reconstruction","Cepstral analysis","Deconvolution","Cost function","Image reconstruction","Additive noise","Acoustic noise","Reverberation","Reconstruction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","signal processing","spectral analysis","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zero mean noise","higher order statistics","signal reconstruction","partial higher order cepstral information","blind deconvolution scheme","reverberation","additive noise","bicepstrum iterative reconstruction algorithm","cepstra coefficients","transmission channels","data sequences","cross-bispectrum","symmetric probability density function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1993","displayDocTitle":"Blind convolution using signal reconstruction from partial higher order cepstral information","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/218138/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"41","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4477073","publicationDate":"June 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind convolution using signal reconstruction from partial higher order cepstral information","sourcePdf":"00218138.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030354S","chronDate":"Jun 1993","isNumber":"5728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"37","articleId":"218138","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":218140,"authors":[{"name":"P.P.

Both uniform and nonuniform decimation ratios are considered, and orthonormal as well as biorthonormal cases are addressed. All the theorems are such that the original convolution reduces to a sum of shorter, decoupled convolutions in the subbands. That is, there is no need to have cross convolution between subbands. For the orthonormal case, expressions for optimal bit allocation and the optimized coding gain are derived. The contribution to coding gain comes partly from the nonuniformity of the signal spectrum and partly from nonuniformity of the filter spectrum. With one of the convolved sequences taken to be the unit pulse function,,e coding gain expressions reduce to those for traditional subband and transform coding. The filter-bank convolver has about the same computational complexity as a traditional convolver, if the analysis bank has small complexity compared to the convolution itself.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.218140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5728","startPage":"2110","endPage":"2130","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/5728/00218140.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthonormal and biorthonormal filter banks as convolvers, and convolutional coding gain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/218140/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1993","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Orthonormal and biorthonormal filter banks as convolvers, and convolutional coding gain","publicationDate":"June 1993","accessionNumber":"4477075","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"41","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthonormal and biorthonormal filter banks as convolvers, and convolutional coding gain","sourcePdf":"00218140.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06157S","chronDate":"Jun 1993","isNumber":"5728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"42","articleId":"218140","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":218142,"authors":[{"name":"K.M.

Then some properties of the CRBs are used to estimate the order of magnitude of the bounds. The analysis is extended to signals whose phase and frequency are continuous but not polynomial. The CRB can be achieved asymptotically if the estimation of the phase coefficients is done by maximum likelihood.

This approach does not require any event scheduling mechanism and can model various logic gate types and delay models. Two concepts are coupled together to form a parallel acceleration technique in the simulator. The first concept deals with representing signals on a line over a period of time as a bit-sequence. This sequence representation can be incorporated into evaluating the output of any logic gate, by comparing the bit-sequences of its inputs with a predetermined series of bit patterns. Numerous bit operations, such as shifting and comparing, must be performed in parallel on the input bit-sequences of various logic components. The second concept, that of an associative memory with word shift capabilities, is really a hardware implementation of these bit operations. Therefore, these concepts are presented as an abstract model followed by its physical realization. APPLES has been simulated at a behavioral and gate level description in System-Hilo.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CMPEUR.1992.218410","publicationTitle":"CompEuro 1992 Proceedings Computer Systems and Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"CompEuro 1992 Proceedings Computer Systems and Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel2/405/5732/00218410.pdf","startPage":"341","endPage":"346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5732","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMPEUR.1992.218410","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=218410","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/218410/","displayDocTitle":"An associative memory approach to parallel logic event-driven simulation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4394915","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-8 May 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An associative memory approach to parallel logic event-driven simulation","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00218410.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026652S","chronDate":"4-8 May 1992","isNumber":"5732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"405","articleId":"218410","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":218447,"authors":[{"name":"M.S.

This search algorithm takes O(k) time units on a sequential machine, where k is the dimension of the codevectors, assuming unit time corresponds to one comparison operation. The proposed architecture employs a single processing element (PE) and O(N) external memory for storing N hyperplanes used in the search, where N is the number of codevectors. Compared with known architectures for VQ in the literature, the proposed design does not perform any multiplication operation, since the search method is independent of any L/sub q/ metric, 1<or=q<or= infinity . It leads to an area efficient design with the PE consisting of a comparator and O(k) registers. Also, the memory used by the design is significantly less than those employed in the known architectures.<<ETX>>","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.1992.218557","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings of the International Conference on Application Specific Array Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings of the International Conference on Application Specific Array Processors","pdfPath":"/iel2/432/5733/00218557.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.1992.218557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5733","startPage":"385","endPage":"399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An architecture for tree search based vector quantization for single chip implementation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=218557","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An architecture for tree search based vector quantization for single chip implementation","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Aug 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/218557/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Aug. 1992","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4399640","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An architecture for tree search based vector quantization for single chip implementation","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00218557.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060421S","chronDate":"4-7 Aug 1992","isNumber":"5733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"432","articleId":"218557","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":218558,"authors":[{"name":"O.

A prominent member of this class of algorithms is the soft-output viterbi algorithm. In this paper two architectures for high speed VLSI implementations of the soft-output viterbi-algorithm are proposed and area estimates are given for both architectures. The well known trade-off between computational complexity and storage requirements is played to obtain new VLSI architectures with increased implementation efficiency.

The achievable throughput and the latency of CORDIC processors using conventional arithmetic are determined by the carry propagation occurring in additions/subtractions, since the CORDIC iterations are directed by the signs of intermediate results. Using a redundant number system, much higher throughput is possible due to the elimination of carry propagation, but an exact sign detection can not be implemented efficiently. The authors derive transformations of the original CORDIC algorithm which result in partially fixed iteration sequences no longer dependent on intermediate signs for the CORDIC vectoring mode as well as the rotation mode. Very fast and efficient carry-save architectures using redundant absolute value computation resulting from the transformed algorithms are described. A CORDIC processor (rotation mode) is presented as an implementation example which to the best of the authors knowledge is the fastest CMOS CORDIC realization today.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Computer architecture","Very large scale integration","Arithmetic","Application software","Singular value decomposition","Throughput","CMOS process","Matrix decomposition","Computer graphics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","digital arithmetic","parallel architectures","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS VLSI","bit-level pipelined architectures","redundant CORDIC implementation","trigonometric/hyperbolic functions","latency","carry propagation","sign detection","carry-save architectures"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=218559","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.1992.218559","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings of the International Conference on Application Specific Array Processors","pdfPath":"/iel2/432/5733/00218559.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.1992.218559","startPage":"358","endPage":"372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5733","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings of the International Conference on Application Specific Array Processors","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High speed bit-level pipelined architectures for redundant CORDIC implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High speed bit-level pipelined architectures for redundant CORDIC implementation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/218559/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Aug 1992","conferenceDate":"4-7 Aug. 1992","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4399638","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High speed bit-level pipelined architectures for redundant CORDIC implementation","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00218559.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066219S","chronDate":"4-7 Aug 1992","isNumber":"5733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"432","citationCount":"10","articleId":"218559","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":218565,"authors":[{"name":"C.M.

Ninety-six such processors working together can update the 64-element nulling weights based on 300 new observations in only 6.7 milliseconds. This is equivalent to 2.88 Giga-ops for a conventional processor. The computations are accurate enough to support 50 dB of S/N improvement in a sidelobe canceller. The connectivity between processors is quite simple and permits MUSE to be realized on a single large wafer, using restructurable VLSI.

Compared with a RAP multiprocessor of similar performance, SPERT represents over an order of magnitude reduction in cost for problems where fixed-point arithmetic is satisfactory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.1992.218573","startPage":"178","endPage":"190","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings of the International Conference on Application Specific Array Processors","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.1992.218573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5733","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings of the International Conference on Application Specific Array Processors","pdfPath":"/iel2/432/5733/00218573.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SPERT: a VLIW/SIMD microprocessor for artificial neural network computations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/218573/","displayDocTitle":"SPERT: a VLIW/SIMD microprocessor for artificial neural network computations","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4387226","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-7 Aug. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Aug 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SPERT: a VLIW/SIMD microprocessor for artificial neural network computations","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00218573.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043938S","chronDate":"4-7 Aug 1992","isNumber":"5733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"432","articleId":"218573","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":219451,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The reverberation statistics are presented as a function of source frequency (20-180 kHz), grazing angle (30 degrees , 20 degrees , 9.5 degrees ), and source beamwidths (1.2 degrees -2.75 degrees ). Generally, the reverberation statistics did not follow a Rayleigh fading model. The model dependence of the reverberation statistics exhibited a complex behavior that ranged from near Gaussian to beyond log-normal. The results show that small changes in the source frequency, grazing angles, and beamwidths caused large variations in the model dependence of the reverberation statistics.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/219529/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"18","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4465210","displayDocTitle":"Reverberation fluctuations from a smooth seafloor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reverberation fluctuations from a smooth seafloor","sourcePdf":"00219529.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04556S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"20","articleId":"219529","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":219532,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

Simulation results in indoor and outdoor channels are compared with theoretical results. Bit error rate (BER) results in simulated frequency-selective fading channels generated by several channel models such as two-ray, constant amplitude, and simulated indoor radio channel impulse models (SIRCIMs) are presented. It is shown that BER is not only dependent on the RMS delay spread, but also on the distribution of temporal and spatial multipath components in local areas. An important result is that a two-ray Rayleigh fading model is a poor fit for indoor wireless channels and, if used, can underestimate the BER by orders of magnitude. A real-time bit error simulation of video transmission using the bit-by-bit error simulator is described. The simulator, called BERSIM, is shown to be a useful tool for evaluating emerging data transmission products for digital mobile communications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.219546","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/5748/00219546.pdf","startPage":"393","endPage":"405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.219546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5748","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit error simulation for pi /4 DQPSK mobile radio communications using two-ray and measurement-based impulse response models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/219546/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","displayDocTitle":"Bit error simulation for pi /4 DQPSK mobile radio communications using two-ray and measurement-based impulse response models","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4484158","volume":"11","issue":"3","publicationDate":"April 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit error simulation for pi /4 DQPSK mobile radio communications using two-ray and measurement-based impulse response models","sourcePdf":"00219546.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027501S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"50","articleId":"219546","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":219547,"authors":[{"name":"W.A.

A new method that reduces the sampling rate of simulations of such systems is developed. The partial rate of products (ParSOP) method reduces the sampling rate by generating only the intermodulation products that lie in a frequency band of interest. The ParSOP method requires that the bandpass nonlinearity be represented by memoryless operations on the complex envelope of the signal and that the subcarriers constituting the frequency-division multiplexed signal are sufficiently separated to prevent significant adjacent channel interference. Simulation results for such systems show that an order of magnitude reduction in the sampling rate is possible while producing only minimal error in the bit error rate estimate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.219548","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/5748/00219548.pdf","startPage":"328","endPage":"339","doi":"10.1109/49.219548","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient simulation of multicarrier digital communication systems in nonlinear channel environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","displayDocTitle":"Efficient simulation of multicarrier digital communication systems in nonlinear channel environments","volume":"11","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1993","accessionNumber":"4484152","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/219548/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient simulation of multicarrier digital communication systems in nonlinear channel environments","sourcePdf":"00219548.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060934S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"11","articleId":"219548","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":219549,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Several recursive methods are available for efficiently computing this likelihood. However, even recursive methods can require prohibitive amounts of computation if the observation sequences are very long. Modifications of the Baum-Welch reestimation algorithm that significantly reduces the computational requirements when the observation sequences contain long stretches of identical observations are discussed.

The use of feed-forward rather than feed-back delays give these networks superior crosstalk performance and more uniform attenuation than existing designs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.219584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5749","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.219584","endPage":"511","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5749/00219584.pdf","startPage":"495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New architectures for optical TDM switching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/219584/","displayDocTitle":"New architectures for optical TDM switching","volume":"11","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4479742","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2003","publicationDate":"March 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New architectures for optical TDM switching","sourcePdf":"00219584.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044201S","chronDate":"Mar 1993","isNumber":"5749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"61","articleId":"219584","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":219588,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Using the pulse compression effect due to nonlinear attenuation characteristics of the modulator, a transform-limited optical pulse can be generated just with sinusoidal modulation. Theoretical calculations and experimental results show that the pulse shape is very close to the sech/sup 2/ shape, and the pulse width can be easily varied by varying the bias and modulation voltages. Transform-limited optical pulse generation with a minimum pulse width of 11 ps was achieved up to 20-GHz repetition rate.

It is shown that the BOA design provides pump redundancy, dual pumping while preventing pump cross-talk, automatic gain control (AGC) potential, and self-gain equalization capability over the whole 1550-nm transmission window.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/68.219702","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.219702","startPage":"660","endPage":"663","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/5753/00219702.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5753","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BOA: balanced optical amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1993","displayDocTitle":"BOA: balanced optical amplifier","publicationDate":"June 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"5","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4485937","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/219702/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BOA: balanced optical amplifier","sourcePdf":"00219702.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025595S","chronDate":"June  1993","isNumber":"5753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"7","articleId":"219702","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":219703,"authors":[{"name":"A.H.

There are basically two different approaches for inferring negative information for disjunctive databases: J. Minker's (1982) generalized closed world assumption (GCWA) and K.A. Ross and R.W. Topor's (1988) disjunctive database rule (DDR). It is argued that neither approach is satisfactory. A database semantics called PWS is proposed. It is shown that for propositional databases with no negative clauses, the problem of determining if a negative ground literal is inferred under the GCWA is co-NP-hard, while the same problem can be solved efficiently under the DDR and PWS. However, in the general case, the problem becomes co-NP-complete for the DDR and PWS. Relationships among GCWA, DDR, and PWS are highlighted. In general, disjunctive clauses are interpreted inclusively under the DDR and unpredictably under the GCWA.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/69.219736","startPage":"282","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/69/5754/00219736.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/69.219736","endPage":"292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5754","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A possible world semantics for disjunctive databases","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/219736/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","displayDocTitle":"A possible world semantics for disjunctive databases","volume":"5","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4473254","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A possible world semantics for disjunctive databases","sourcePdf":"00219736.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059021S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"27","articleId":"219736","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":219754,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Resources reclaiming refers to the problem of utilizing the resources left unused by a task when it executes in less than its worst case computation time, or when a task is deleted from the current schedule. Dynamic resource reclaiming algorithms that are effective, avoid any run time anomalies, and have bounded overhead costs that are independent of the number of tasks in the schedule are presented. Each task is assumed to have a worst case computation time, a deadline, and a set of resource requirements. The algorithms utilize the information given in a multiprocessor task schedule and perform online local optimization.

Solving nonlinear equations by a globally convergent embedding algorithm requires the evaluation and factoring of a Jacobian matrix at many points along the embedding curve. Ways to optimize the Jacobian matrix on a hypercube are described. Several static and dynamical strategies for assigning components of the Jacobian to processors on the hypercube are investigated. It is found that a static rectangular grid mapping is the preferred choice for inclusion in a robust parallel mathematical software package. The static linear mapping is a viable alternative when there are many common subexpressions in the component evaluation, and the dynamic assignment strategy should only be considered when there is large variation in the evaluation times for the components, leading to a load imbalance on the processors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/71.219760","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5755","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.219760","endPage":"465","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/5755/00219760.pdf","startPage":"458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The parallel complexity of embedding algorithms for the solution of systems of nonlinear equations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/219760/","displayDocTitle":"The parallel complexity of embedding algorithms for the solution of systems of nonlinear equations","volume":"4","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4466306","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The parallel complexity of embedding algorithms for the solution of systems of nonlinear equations","sourcePdf":"00219760.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046742S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5755","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"9","articleId":"219760","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":219761,"authors":[{"name":"W.J.

Basic parameters of the circuit are derived using the time-domain analysis and Fourier series techniques. The rectifier diodes turn on and off at low dv/dt, yielding low switching noise and low switching losses. Diode parasitic capacitances do not adversely affect the circuit operation. The absolute value of di/dt is limited at diode turn-off, significantly reducing the reverse recovery current. The rectifier input voltage waveform differs only slightly from an ideal sinusoid, resulting in a low total harmonic distortion. The circuit has theoretically zero-ripple voltage and, therefore, zero loss in the equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the filter capacitor. The Class E full-wave topology has lower diode conduction loss than the Class E half-wave rectifier. The efficiency is almost constant over the load range from 10% to 100% of the full load. The rectifier offers high-power density and high-frequency rectification and is suitable for low-voltage and high-current applications, as shown by experimental results given for a 75-W rectifier which was operated at 1 MHz with an output of 5 V and 15 A. The theoretical and experimental results were in good agreement.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/81.219821","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/5758/00219821.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5758","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.219821","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","startPage":"73","endPage":"85","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Class E full-wave low dv/dt rectifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=219821","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1993","displayDocTitle":"Class E full-wave low dv/dt rectifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/219821/","volume":"40","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1993","accessionNumber":"4486439","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Class E full-wave low dv/dt rectifier","sourcePdf":"00219821.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033846S","chronDate":"Feb 1993","isNumber":"5758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"29","articleId":"219821","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":219823,"authors":[{"name":"G.D.

It is especially suited for double-sided surface-mounted boards, which require complex three-dimensional search operations over multiple wiring planes. The novel features of the design include a hexagonal interconnection scheme to improve workload distributions during multilayer concurrent search operations and the VLSI custom design of the processors. Particular emphasis has been placed on the demands of maze routing. A cell-address propagation scheme, which is quite different from the traditional grid-coordinate approach, is discussed. It provides rapid lookup of pertinent routing information and can be extended to any distributed memory multiprocessor system. A global pipelining scheme of cell updates and expands is discussed. Experimental results are presented relating the speedup to various criteria for two different modes of parallel wave propagation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/92.219905","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/5763/00219905.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.219905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5763","startPage":"31","endPage":"45","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coprocessor design for multilayer surface-mounted PCB routing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=219905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Coprocessor design for multilayer surface-mounted PCB routing","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/219905/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 1993","accessionNumber":"4411544","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coprocessor design for multilayer surface-mounted PCB routing","sourcePdf":"00219905.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046591S","chronDate":"March  1993","isNumber":"5763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"3","articleId":"219905","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":219908,"authors":[{"name":"R.

A particular class of piecewise continuous controller which exponentially stabilizes the robot about the origin was previously proposed by the authors (1991). This approach is extended to stabilize about an arbitrary position and orientation, and to track a sequence of points.

Analysis of a contact motion shows the necessity of contact control not only after the collision, but also before it. Using a model of the force-controlled end-effector and its environment, forces generated at the contact are formulated as outputs of an autonomous system of which the initial condition is determined by the approach velocity. The optimal approach velocity is defined as the velocity that minimizes a performance index. A proportional relation between the optimal approach velocity and the contact force reference is derived analytically based on a mass-damper-spring model of the force-controlled end-effector and its environment. Results of the simulation and the experiment are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force control","Optimal control","Control systems","Motion analysis","Velocity control","Switches","Mathematical model","Intelligent systems","Performance analysis","Assembly"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["force control","manipulators","optimal control","performance index","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision force control","robots","end-effector","optimal approach velocity","manipulator","contact motion","autonomous system","performance index","contact force reference","mass-damper-spring model"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1992.219947","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1992 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1992 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/399/5764/00219947.pdf","startPage":"1928","endPage":"1934 vol.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1992.219947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal approach velocity of end-effector to the environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=219947","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal approach velocity of end-effector to the environment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/219947/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4395298","conferenceDate":"12-14 May 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 May 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal approach velocity of end-effector to the environment","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"00219947.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041921S","chronDate":"12-14 May 1992","isNumber":"5764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"399","citationCount":"26","articleId":"219947","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":219984,"authors":[{"name":"D.

It is well known that such systems cannot be stabilized to a point using smooth static-state feedback. The authors suggest the use of control laws for stabilizing a system about a trajectory, instead of a point. Given a nonlinear system and a desired nominal feasible trajectory, an explicit control law which will locally exponentially stabilize the system to the desired trajectory is given. The theory is applied to several examples, including a car-like robot.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1992.219987","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1992 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1992 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/399/5764/00219987.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1992.219987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5764","startPage":"1999","endPage":"2004 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stabilization of trajectories for systems with nonholonomic constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=219987","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stabilization of trajectories for systems with nonholonomic constraints","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/219987/","conferenceDate":"12-14 May 1992","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4391082","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stabilization of trajectories for systems with nonholonomic constraints","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"00219987.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034413S","chronDate":"12-14 May 1992","isNumber":"5764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"399","citationCount":"24","articleId":"219987","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":219989,"authors":[{"name":"N.S.

A method to simplify the dynamics using partial precompensation which uses the constraint equations of motion is presented. This approach is applied to a simple example.
