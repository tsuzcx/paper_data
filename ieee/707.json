A new forecast technique is proposed based on a multiparametric programming formulation that partitions the uncertainty parameter space into critical regions from which the conditional probability mass function of the real-time LMP is estimated using Monte Carlo techniques. The proposed methodology incorporates uncertainty models such as load and stochastic generation forecasts and system contingency models. With the use of offline computation of multiparametric linear programming, online computation cost is significantly reduced.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Jan. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070121/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15025198","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7070121/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","conferenceDate":"5-8 Jan. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Forecast of Real-Time LMP via Multiparametric Programming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Forecast of Real-Time LMP via Multiparametric Programming","confLoc":"Kauai, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"7367c549.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051358S","chronDate":"5-8 Jan. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7068092","isNumber":"7069647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7068092","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7069647","articleId":"7070121","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7070238,"authors":[{"name":"Michele Maasberg","affiliation":["The University of Texas at San, Antonio"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Maasberg","id":"37085582206"},{"name":"John Warren","affiliation":["The University of Texas at San, Antonio"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Warren","id":"37085577018"},{"name":"Nicole L.

We examine insider threat incidents with malicious intent and propose an explanation through a relationship between Dark Triad personality traits and the insider threat. Although Dark Triad personality traits have emerged in insider threat cases and deviant workplace behavior studies, they have not been labeled as such and little empirical research has examined this phenomenon. This paper builds on previous research on insider threat and introduces ten propositions concerning the relationship between Dark Triad personality traits and insider threat behavior. We include behavioral antecedents based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and Capability Means Opportunity (CMO) model and the factors affecting those antecedents. This research addresses the behavioral aspect of the insider threat and provides new information in support of academics and practitioners.","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.2015.423","publicationTitle":"2015 48th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 48th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel7/7068092/7069647/07070238.pdf","startPage":"3518","endPage":"3526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.2015.423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7069647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Dark Side of the Insider: Detecting the Insider Threat through Examination of Dark Triad Personality Traits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7070238","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Jan. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070238/","displayDocTitle":"The Dark Side of the Insider: Detecting the Insider Threat through Examination of Dark Triad Personality Traits","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"15024920","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7070238/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Jan. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Dark Side of the Insider: Detecting the Insider Threat through Examination of Dark Triad Personality Traits","confLoc":"Kauai, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"7367d518.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084601S","chronDate":"5-8 Jan. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7068092","isNumber":"7069647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7068092","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7069647","articleId":"7070238","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7070388,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Goul","affiliation":["Arizona State University"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Goul","id":"37390623200"},{"name":"Sule Balkan","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University"],"firstName":"Sule","lastName":"Balkan","id":"37396947300"},{"name":"Daniel Dolk","affiliation":["Naval Postgraduate School"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Dolk","id":"37313750600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7367-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1605"}],"articleNumber":"7070388","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":242},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7070388","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Business","Monitoring","Analytical models","Real-time systems","Measurement","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["customer services","information systems","supply chains"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["predictive analytics-driven campaign management support systems","design science research foundations","marketing resource management","customer-driven supply chains","batch-oriented CMMS","fragmented CMMS","domain specific performance measurement","domain specific performance monitoring","monitoring engine","information system design theory","CMSS design","DEEPER","predictive analytics deployment methodology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Predictive Analytics","Campaign Management Support Systems"]}],"abstract":"This paper uses design science research foundations to establish requirements for predictive analytics-driven Campaign Management Support Systems (CMSS).

Current CMMS are fragmented, disconnected and batch-oriented - they are not enterprise-centric.

However, they should given examples of recent campaign failures at Target and other companies. Further, they do not support domain specific performance measurement and monitoring.

However, the wireless link capacity as well as the bandwidth of the radio access networks and the backhaul network cannot practically cope with the explosive growth in mobile traffic load. In this article, we mainly focus on a new novel framework of cooperative cell caching for future mobile cellular networks, where the base station of each cell can have certain capability of caching popular contents. Then we carry out necessary theoretical modeling-based analysis. We also propose to utilize prefix-tree aggregation to improve the caching performance among cells, and discuss potential deployment issues for caching in 5G mobile networks.

To address the multipath channel of such environments a fingerprinting scheme is proposed. One of the drawbacks to this class of methods is the large initial cost associated with establishing a database matrix. This issue is addressed by using a multi-channel filtering method adapted from the H.264 video standard to recover the incomplete data. Position estimation is accomplished via a modified k-nearest neighbor approach to pattern matching. We show through simulation that not only are we able to achieve compelling fidelity in the reconstructed databases from highly incomplete data, but that we are able to do so at a relatively low computational cost. Finally, our results demonstrate that we are able to achieve accurate position estimates vis-\u00e0-vis severe under sampling and noisy channel conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070468/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Jan. 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Jan. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7070468/","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"15025135","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Location Estimation via Sparse Signal Reconstruction in Subsampled Overcomplete Dictionaries for Wireless 4G Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Location Estimation via Sparse Signal Reconstruction in Subsampled Overcomplete Dictionaries for Wireless 4G Networks","confLoc":"Kauai, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"7367f432.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0564S","chronDate":"5-8 Jan. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7068092","isNumber":"7069647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7068092","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7069647","articleId":"7070468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7070479,"authors":[{"name":"Billy Kidwell","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Kentucky, Lexington, USA"],"firstName":"Billy","lastName":"Kidwell","id":"37887753500"},{"name":"Jane Huffman Hayes","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Kentucky, Lexington, USA"],"firstName":"Jane Huffman","lastName":"Hayes","id":"37959175600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6923-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7070479","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7070479","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software","Taxonomy","Testing","Inspection","Organizations","Automation","Software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","pattern clustering","program diagnostics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learned project-specific fault taxonomy","software analytics","fault classification","machine learning technique","clustering","organization-specific fault taxonomy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fault taxonomy; machine learning; softwarerepositories; clustering"]}],"abstract":"This position paper argues that fault classification provides vital information for software analytics, and that machine learning techniques such as clustering can be applied to learn a project- (or organization-) specific fault taxonomy.

We assume that the users are concentrated at certain areas in the cell, i.e., they form hotspots. While some of the hotspots are assumed to have a small cell in their vicinity, the others are directly served by the macrocell. Due to a relatively small area of each hotspot, the users lying in a particular hotspot appear to be almost co-located to the macrocells, which are typically deployed at some elevation. We assume a large number of antennas at the macrocell relative to the number of users simultaneously served. In this \u201cmassive MIMO\u201d regime, the channel vectors become highly directional. We exploit this directionality in the channel vectors to obtain spatial blanking, i.e., concentrating transmission energy only in certain directions while creating transmission opportunities for the small cells lying in the other directions. In addition to this inherent interference suppression, we also develop three low-complexity interference coordination strategies: turn off small cells based on the amount of cross-tier interference they receive or cause to the scheduled macrocell hotspots; schedule hotspots such that treating interference as noise is approximately optimal for the resulting Gaussian interference channel; and offload some of the macrocell hotspots to nearby small cells to improve throughput fairness across all hotspots. For all these schemes, we study the relative merits and demerits of uniform deployment of small cells vs. deploying more small cells towards the cell center or the cell edge.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070653/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","volume":"33","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15142441","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7070653/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Massive-MIMO Meets HetNet: Interference Coordination Through Spatial Blanking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Massive-MIMO Meets HetNet: Interference Coordination Through Spatial Blanking","sourcePdf":"jsac-adhikary-2416986-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082178S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7108084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"7108084","articleId":"7070653","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7070654,"authors":[{"name":"Melhem El Helou","affiliation":["Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure d'Ing\u00e9nieurs de Beyrouth (ESIB), Faculty of Engineering, Saint Joseph University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7108084/7070654/elhel-2416987-small.gif","p":["Melhem El Helou (S'08\u2013M'15) received the engineering and master degrees in communications and networking from the Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure d'Ing\u00e9nieurs de Beyrouth (ESIB), Faculty of Engineering, Saint Joseph University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon, in 2009 and 2010, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in communication networks from IRISA Research Institute, University of Rennes 1, Rennes, France and Saint Joseph University of Beirut, in 2014.

To reduce network signaling and processing load, decisions are generally delegated to mobile users. Mobile users aim to selfishly maximize their utility. However, as they do not cooperate, their decisions may lead to performance inefficiency. In this paper, to overcome this limitation, we propose a network-assisted approach. The network provides information for the mobiles to make more accurate decisions. By appropriately tuning network information, user decisions are globally expected to meet operator objectives, avoiding undesirable network states. Deriving network information is formulated as a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP), and optimal policies are computed using the Policy Iteration algorithm. Also, and since network parameters may not be easily obtained, a reinforcement learning approach is introduced to derive what to signal to mobiles. The performances of optimal, learning-based, and heuristic policies, such as blocking probability and average throughput, are analyzed. When tuning thresholds are pertinently set, our heuristic achieves performance very close to the optimal solution. Moreover, although it provides lower performance, our learning-based algorithm has the crucial advantage of requiring no prior parameterization.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Network-Assisted Approach for RAT Selection in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2416987","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7108084/07070654.pdf","startPage":"1055","endPage":"1067","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2015.2416987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7108084","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7070654","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070654/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","displayDocTitle":"A Network-Assisted Approach for RAT Selection in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7070654/","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15142458","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Network-Assisted Approach for RAT Selection in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"jsac-elhelou-2416987-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138255S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7108084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"7108084","articleId":"7070654","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7070655,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7108084/7070655/yu-2417013-small.gif","p":["\n\nBo Yu received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Huazhong \nUniversity of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2008 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from \nUniversity of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA, in 2010.

At the same time, 3GPP is also standardizing macrocell-assisted small cell heterogeneous architectures for inclusion in LTE Release 12 as a solution offering high data rate to user terminals (UEs) along with high system capacity through spatial reuse of spectrum. In this paper, we focus on a particular small cell architecture proposed by DOCOMO, known as the Phantom Cell architecture, which provides the option to support dynamic TDD. For an arbitrarily-located UE in a small cell network, we apply results from stochastic geometry to derive expressions for the distribution of DL signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) at an arbitrary UE and the distribution of UL SINR at its serving base station (BS). The analytical results are verified by system level simulations. These results can be used to study aspects of system design for small cells, and the sensitivity of SINR to the extent of synchronization across small cells employing dynamic TDD. In order to deal with the severe inter-cell interference (ICI) problem in dynamic TDD, we further propose a frequency domain interference coordination technique. Finally, system level simulations based on more realistic system models and assumptions are conducted to evaluate the performance of dynamic TDD systems and the proposed interference coordination technique.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7108084/07070655.pdf","startPage":"1201","endPage":"1213","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2417013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2015.2417013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7108084","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7070655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic TDD Support in Macrocell-Assisted Small Cell Architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Interference","Microprocessors","Phantoms","Signal to noise ratio","Synchronization","Dynamic scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","cellular radio","frequency-domain analysis","Long Term Evolution","radiofrequency interference","stochastic processes","synchronisation","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic TDD support system","dynamic subframe allocation","time division duplex","3rd Generation Partnership Project","3GPP","Long Term Evolution","LTE Release 11 timeframe","macrocell-assisted small cell heterogeneous architectures","user terminals","high data rate","UEs","high system capacity","spatial spectrum reuse","phantom cell architecture","stochastic geometry","DL signal to interference plus noise ratio","SINR","UL SINR distribution","base station","system level simulations","synchronization","inter-cell interference","ICI","frequency domain interference coordination technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic TDD","small cell","interference coordination","stochastic geometry"]},{"kwd":["Dynamic TDD","small cell","interference coordination","stochastic geometry"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic TDD Support in Macrocell-Assisted Small Cell Architecture","volume":"33","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7070655/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15142455","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic TDD Support in Macrocell-Assisted Small Cell Architecture","sourcePdf":"jsac-yu-2417013-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144016S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7108084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"7108084","articleId":"7070655","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7070656,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Sanguinetti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell'Informazione, LANEAS, CentralSup\u00e9lec, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7108084/7070656/sangu-2416991-small.gif","p":["\n\nLuca Sanguinetti (S'04\u2013M'06) received the Laurea \nTelecommunications Engineer degree (cum laude) and the Ph.D. degree in information engineering from the University of \nPisa, Italy, in 2002 and 2005, respectively.

The static and low mobility user equipment terminals (UEs) are associated with the SCAs while those with medium-to-high mobility are served by the macro BS. A reverse time division duplexing (TDD) protocol is used by the two tiers, which allows the BS to locally estimate both the intra-tier and inter-tier channels. This knowledge is then used at the BS either in the uplink (UL) or in the downlink (DL) to simultaneously serve the macro UEs (MUEs) and to provide the wireless backhaul to SCAs. A concatenated linear precoding technique employing either zero-forcing (ZF) or regularized ZF is used at the BS to simultaneously serve MUEs and SCAs in DL while nulling interference toward those SCAs in UL. We evaluate and characterize the performance of the system through the power consumption of UL and DL transmissions under the assumption that target rates must be satisfied and imperfect channel state information is available for MUEs. The analysis is conducted in the asymptotic regime where the number of BS antennas and the network size (MUEs and SCAs) grow large with fixed ratios. Results from large system analysis are used to provide concise formulae for the asymptotic UL and DL transmit powers and precoding vectors under the above assumptions. Numerical results are used to validate the analysis in different settings and to make comparisons with alternative network architectures.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070656/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","volume":"33","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15142445","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7070656/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Interference Management in 5G Reverse TDD HetNets With Wireless Backhaul: A Large System Analysis","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"FP7 Network of Excellence in Wireless COMmunications NEWCOM#","grantNumber":"318306)"},{"fundingName":"People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) FP7 PIEF-GA-2012-330731 Dense4Green"},{"fundingName":"ERC","grantNumber":"305123 MORE"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Management in 5G Reverse TDD HetNets With Wireless Backhaul: A Large System Analysis","sourcePdf":"jsac-sanguinetti-2416991-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140746S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7108084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"7108084","articleId":"7070656","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7070658,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed R.

While inter-cell signaling can coordinate femtocells by providing the status information of neighbor cells explicitly, signaling delay-which may result from a limited signaling rate to reduce the resulting overhead, network latency, etc.-and its impact on the behavior of distributed coordination has not been explored before. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for the distributed coordination of co-channel femtocells based on asynchronous inter-cell signaling, called asynchronous coordination of co-channel femtocells (ACoF). ACoF improves solutions iteratively; femtocells update radio resource usage based on the received information, which usually gets outdated due to delayed signaling and asynchronous update behavior. ACoF allows each femtocell to adjust its signaling rate depending on its local conditions for fine-grained cost minimization, but at the expense of higher degree of inconsistency of femtocells' knowledge. Despite such asynchrony and inconsistency, the solution yielded by ACoF is guaranteed to converge to a global optimum under a certain condition of configuration parameters, which we prove theoretically. We design the optimization method of per-cell signaling rate for both wired and over-the-air signaling. Finally, we present a joint muting and transmit power adjustment scheme designed for ACoF and evaluate its convergence behavior and performance gain.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2416983","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7108084/07070660.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2015.2416983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7108084","startPage":"1127","endPage":"1139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Coordination of Co-Channel Femtocells via Inter-Cell Signaling With Arbitrary Delay","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7070660","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Coordination of Co-Channel Femtocells via Inter-Cell Signaling With Arbitrary Delay","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070660/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"33","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15142448","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7070660/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"NRF-2014R1A1A2059515"},{"fundingName":"US National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1160775 and CNS-1317411"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Coordination of Co-Channel Femtocells via Inter-Cell Signaling With Arbitrary Delay","sourcePdf":"jsac-yun-2416983-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10752S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7108084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7108084","articleId":"7070660","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7070661,"authors":[{"name":"Mugen Peng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7108084/7070661/peng-2416985-small.gif","p":["\nMugen Peng (M'05\u2013SM'11) received the B.E. degree in electronics engineering from Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications, China, in 2000 and the Ph.D. degree in communication and information system from the Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications (BUPT), China, in 2005.

The interference among remote radio heads (RRHs) can be suppressed with centralized cooperative processing in the base band unit (BBU) pool, while the inter-tier interference between RRHs and macro base stations (MBSs) is still challenging in H-CRANs. In this paper, to mitigate this inter-tier interference, a contract-based interference coordination framework is proposed, in which three scheduling schemes are involved, and the downlink transmission interval is divided into three phases accordingly. The core idea of the proposed framework is that the BBU pool covering all RRHs is selected as the principal that would offer a contract to the MBS, and the MBS as the agent decides whether to accept the contract or not according to an individual rational constraint. An optimal contract design that maximizes the rate-based utility is derived when perfect channel state information (CSI) is acquired at both principal and agent. Furthermore, contract optimization under the situation in which only partial CSI can be obtained from practical channel estimation is addressed as well. Monte Carlo simulations are provided to confirm the analysis, and simulation results show that the proposed framework can significantly increase the transmission data rates over baselines, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed contract-based solution.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2416985","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7108084/07070661.pdf","startPage":"1140","endPage":"1153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7108084","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2015.2416985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contract-Based Interference Coordination in Heterogeneous Cloud Radio Access Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7070661","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","displayDocTitle":"Contract-Based Interference Coordination in Heterogeneous Cloud Radio Access Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070661/","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15142456","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7070661/","volume":"33","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61222103 and 61361166005"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2014AA01A701"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4131003"},{"fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1343210"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contract-Based Interference Coordination in Heterogeneous Cloud Radio Access Networks","sourcePdf":"jsac-peng-2416985-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100802S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7108084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"7108084","articleId":"7070661","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7070662,"authors":[{"name":"Man Hon Cheung","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7108084/7070662/cheun-2416989-small.gif","p":["\n\nMan Hon Cheung received the B.Eng. and M.Phil. degrees in information \nengineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in 2005 and 2007, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in \nelectrical and computer engineering from the University of British Columbia (UBC) in 2012.

However, previously proposed offloading schemes mainly focus on reducing the cellular data usage, without paying too much attention on the quality of service (QoS) requirements of the applications. In this paper, we study the Wi-Fi offloading problem with delay-tolerant applications under usage-based pricing. We aim to achieve a good tradeoff between the user's payment and its QoS characterized by the file transfer deadline. We first propose a general Delay- Aware Wi-Fi Offloading and Network Selection (DAWN) algorithm for a general single-user decision scenario. We then analytically establish the sufficient conditions, under which the optimal policy exhibits a threshold structure in terms of both the time and file size. As a result, we propose a monotone DAWN algorithm that approximately solves the general offloading problem, and has a much lower computational complexity comparing to the optimal algorithm. Simulation results show that both the general and monotone DAWN schemes achieve a high probability of completing file transfer under a stringent deadline, and require the lowest payment under a non-stringent deadline as compared with three heuristic schemes.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2416989","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7108084/07070662.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2015.2416989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7108084","startPage":"1214","endPage":"1223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DAWN: Delay-Aware Wi-Fi Offloading and Network Selection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7070662","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"DAWN: Delay-Aware Wi-Fi Offloading and Network Selection","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070662/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"33","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15142452","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7070662/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"General Research Funds (Project Number CUHK 412713 and 14202814)"},{"fundingName":"University Grant Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DAWN: Delay-Aware Wi-Fi Offloading and Network Selection","sourcePdf":"jsac-cheung-2416989-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103938S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7108084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"7108084","articleId":"7070662","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7070663,"authors":[{"name":"Milica I.

The RF link is subject to Rayleigh fading, while the FSO link is affected by atmospheric turbulence, modeled by Gamma-Gamma distribution. Novel analytical expressions for the outage probability and average bit error rate (BER) are derived. Numerical results are presented and validated by Monte-Carlo simulations. The outage probability and average BER dependence on turbulence strength, average signalto-noise ratio (SNR) over RF hop, average electrical SNR over FSO hop, number of relays, and rank of selected relay, are also investigated, while the effect of time correlation between current source-relay channel and its outdated CSI, is considered. The results illustrate that the outdated CSI used for the relay selection has a strong effect on the system performance, especially in weak turbulence conditions of the FSO hop. Furthermore, the improvement of the system performance with increase of the number of the relays is highly dependent on the FSO channel state.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070663/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July1, 1 2015","volume":"33","issue":"13","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15253494","dateOfInsertion":"01 June 2015","publicationDate":"1 July1, 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7070663/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Partial Relay Selection With Outdated Channel State Estimation in Mixed RF/FSO Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000782","fundingName":"European Science Foundation","grantNumber":"IC1101"},{"fundingName":"OPTICWISE Action \u201cOptical Wireless Communications\u2014An Emerging Technology,\u201d Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology Development of the Republic of Serbia","grantNumber":"TR-32028 and III-44006"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of the Foreign Affairs of Norway within the NORBAS Project"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial Relay Selection With Outdated Channel State Estimation in Mixed RF/FSO Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-petkovic-2416972-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090427S","chronDate":"July1, 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7115988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"7115988","articleId":"7070663","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7070664,"authors":[{"name":"Haibo Dai","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7108084/7070664/dai-2416988-small.gif","p":["Haibo Dai received the M.S. degree from Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China, in 2013.

The original throughput maximization problem is NP-hard and we propose solving it by using game theoretic stochastic learning approaches. To this end, we first transform the original problem into a tractable form, which has a weighted utility function. Then we prove that an exact potential game applies and it exists the best Nash equilibria which is a near optimal solution of the original problem when an efficient solution method of the weights is employed. To obtain the optimal solution, we redesign the utility function by leveraging a state space to formulate the original problem into an ordinal state based potential game, which is proved that it exists a recurrent state equilibrium point that maximizes system throughput. Furthermore, we propose two different variants of Max-logit learning algorithm based on these two games respectively: one is a simultaneous learning algorithm with less information exchange, which achieves the best Nash equilibria point of the exact potential game and the other is an efficient learning algorithm for the ordinal state based potential game, which can converge to the global optimization solution. Finally, numerical results are given to validate that theoretical findings.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7108084/07070664.pdf","startPage":"1068","endPage":"1081","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2416988","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2015.2416988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7108084","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7070664","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Game Theoretic Max-logit Learning Approaches for Joint Base Station Selection and Resource Allocation in Heterogeneous Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Optimized production technology","Resource management","Joints","Base stations","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","computational complexity","frequency division multiple access","game theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","OFDM modulation","optimisation","resource allocation","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theoretic max-logit learning approaches","joint base station selection","resource allocation","heterogeneous cellular networks","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","OFDMA","throughput maximization problem","NP-hard problem","game theoretic stochastic learning approaches","weighted utility function","Nash equilibria","ordinal state based potential game","recurrent state equilibrium point","simultaneous learning algorithm","global optimization solution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Heterogeneous networks","game theory","self organization","Max-logit learning"]},{"kwd":["Heterogeneous networks","game theory","self-organization","Max-logit learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070664/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Game Theoretic Max-logit Learning Approaches for Joint Base Station Selection and Resource Allocation in Heterogeneous Networks","volume":"33","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7070664/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15142450","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61372101, 61422105 and 61271018"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project of China","grantNumber":"2012ZX03004-005-003"},{"fundingName":"Research Project of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20130019 and BE2012167"},{"fundingName":"Joint Funds of the National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1404615"},{"fundingName":"Open Funds of State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves","grantNumber":"K201504"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Game Theoretic Max-logit Learning Approaches for Joint Base Station Selection and Resource Allocation in Heterogeneous Networks","sourcePdf":"jsac-dai-2416988-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122456S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7108084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7108084","articleId":"7070664","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7070665,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Catarinucci","affiliation":["Dept. of Innovation Eng., Univ. of Salento, Lecce, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Luca Catarinucci is currently an Assistant Professor of electromagnetic fields and a Professor of microwaves with the University of Salento, Lecce, Italy.

Among others, mainly radio frequency identification (RFID), wireless sensor network (WSN), and smart mobile technologies are leading this evolutionary trend. In the wake of this tendency, this paper proposes a novel, IoT-aware, smart architecture for automatic monitoring and tracking of patients, personnel, and biomedical devices within hospitals and nursing institutes. Staying true to the IoT vision, we propose a smart hospital system (SHS), which relies on different, yet complementary, technologies, specifically RFID, WSN, and smart mobile, interoperating with each other through a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)/IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN)/representational state transfer (REST) network infrastructure. The SHS is able to collect, in real time, both environmental conditions and patients' physiological parameters via an ultra-low-power hybrid sensing network (HSN) composed of 6LoWPAN nodes integrating UHF RFID functionalities. Sensed data are delivered to a control center where an advanced monitoring application (MA) makes them easily accessible by both local and remote users via a REST web service. The simple proof of concept implemented to validate the proposed SHS has highlighted a number of key capabilities and aspects of novelty, which represent a significant step forward compared to the actual state of the art.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2015.2417684","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2015.2417684","startPage":"515","endPage":"526","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/7331244/07070665.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7331244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An IoT-Aware Architecture for Smart Healthcare Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070665/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"An IoT-Aware Architecture for Smart Healthcare Systems","volume":"2","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15602518","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7070665/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An IoT-Aware Architecture for Smart Healthcare Systems","sourcePdf":"jiot-patrono-2417684-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091875S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"7331244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"524","xplore-issue":"7331244","articleId":"7070665","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7070667,"authors":[{"name":"Tiejun Lv","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7108084/7070667/lv-2416984-small.gif","p":["\nTiejun Lv (M'08\u2013SM'12) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 1997 and 2000, respectively.

We investigate secure communications in a two-tier downlink HetNet, which comprises one macrocell and several femtocells. Each cell has multiple users and an eavesdropper attempts to wiretap the intended macrocell user. First, we consider an orthogonal spectrum allocation strategy to eliminate co-channel interference, and propose the secrecy transmit beamforming only operating in the macrocell (STB-OM) as a partial solution for secure communication in HetNet. Next, we consider a secrecy-oriented non-orthogonal spectrum allocation strategy and propose two cooperative STBs which rely on the collaboration amongst the macrocell base station (MBS) and the adjacent femtocell base stations (FBSs). Our first cooperative STB is the STB sequentially operating in the macrocell and femtocells (STB-SMF), where the cooperative FBSs individually design their STB matrices and then feed their performance metrics to the MBS for guiding the STB in the macrocell. Aiming to improve the performance of STB-SMF, we further propose the STB jointly designed in the macrocell and femtocells (STB-JMF), where all cooperative FBSs feed channel state information to the MBS for designing the joint STB. Unlike conventional STBs conceived for broadcasting or interference channels, the three proposed STB schemes all entail relatively sophisticated optimizations due to QoS constraints of the legitimate users. To efficiently use these STB schemes, the original optimization problems are reformulated and convex optimization techniques, such as second-order cone programming and semidefinite programming, are invoked to obtain the optimal solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed STB schemes are highly effective in improving the secrecy rate performance of HetNet.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2416984","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2015.2416984","startPage":"1154","endPage":"1170","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7108084/07070667.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7108084","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secrecy Transmit Beamforming for Heterogeneous Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070667/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Secrecy Transmit Beamforming for Heterogeneous Networks","volume":"33","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15142447","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7070667/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61271188, 61401041 and D151100000115002"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2014RC0106"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secrecy Transmit Beamforming for Heterogeneous Networks","sourcePdf":"jsac-yang-2416984-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126366S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7108084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"7108084","articleId":"7070667","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7070669,"authors":[{"name":"Yicheng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Huawei Technologies Canada Inc., Kanata, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7108084/7070669/lin-2417011-small.gif","p":["Yicheng Lin (S'09) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in communication engineering from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2007 and 2010, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2014.

Users are associated with base-stations (BSs) based on the biased downlink received power. Spectrum is either shared or orthogonally partitioned among the tiers. This paper models the placement of BSs in different tiers as spatial point processes and adopts stochastic geometry to derive the theoretical mean proportionally fair utility of the network based on the coverage rate. By formulating and solving the network utility maximization problem, the optimal user association bias factors and spectrum partition ratios are analytically obtained for the multi-tier network. The resulting analysis reveals that the downlink and uplink user associations do not have to be symmetric. For uplink under spectrum sharing, if all tiers have the same target signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), distance-based user association is shown to be optimal under a variety of path loss and power control settings. For both downlink and uplink, under orthogonal spectrum partition, it is shown that the optimal proportion of spectrum allocated to each tier should match the proportion of users associated with that tier. Simulations validate the analytical results. Under typical system parameters, simulation results suggest that spectrum partition performs better for downlink in terms of utility, while spectrum sharing performs better for uplink with power control.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2417011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2015.2417011","startPage":"1025","endPage":"1039","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7108084/07070669.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7108084","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing User Association and Spectrum Allocation in HetNets: A Utility Perspective","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070669/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing User Association and Spectrum Allocation in HetNets: A Utility Perspective","volume":"33","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15142453","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7070669/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing User Association and Spectrum Allocation in HetNets: A Utility Perspective","sourcePdf":"jsac-lin-2417011-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132936S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7108084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"7108084","articleId":"7070669","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7070670,"authors":[{"name":"Ruoyu Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7108084/7070670/sun-2416982-small.gif","p":["Ruoyu Sun received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2009.

In this paper, we systematically study the joint BS association and power allocation problem for a downlink cellular network under the max-min fairness criterion. First, we show that this problem is NP-hard. Second, we show that the upper bound of the optimal value can be easily computed, and propose a two-stage algorithm to find a high-quality suboptimal solution. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is near-optimal in the high-SNR regime. Third, we show that the problem under some additional mild assumptions can be solved to global optima in polynomial time by a semi-distributed algorithm.

Considering that the severe intra-tier interference among dense LPNs and inter-tier interference between LPNs and HPNs are challenging the successful rollout and commercial operations of underlay HetNets, a great emphasis is given towards advanced techniques that take interference control, radio resource allocation, and self-organization into account to enhance both SE and EE in this paper. The interference control techniques presented in this paper are classified as the spatial interference coordination at the transmitter and the interference cancelation at the receiver. For the radio resource allocation, the multi-dimensional optimization, cross-layer optimization, and cooperative radio resource management are comprehensively summarized. The self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-healing techniques for the self-organized underlay HetNets are surveyed.

The on-chip antenna design is optimized to meet both process reliability specifications and radiation performance, and corresponding design guidelines are provided. The fabricated on-chip antennas show the state-of-the-art performance with a peak gain of 4.7 dBi, simulated radiation efficiency of 82%, and measured radiation efficiency of 72%-76% using the gain/directivity (G/D) and wheeler-cap methods at 143 GHz. The antenna demonstrates a 3-dB gain bandwidth of more than 30 GHz and 10-dB impedance bandwidth greater than 20 GHz (14% impedance bandwidth). The measurements of the on-package end-fire antenna showed very comparable results with a peak measured gain of 6 dBi and a simulated and measured radiation efficiency of 92% and 86% at 143 GHz.

Considering new emerging features with possible priorities, a novel centralized priority scheduling mechanism is mainly explored in this paper. First, related pivotal aspects of environment and driverless vehicles are modeled by fusing their physical and kinematic characters. Based on these models, PTI-related motions are further abstracted as several reservation-oriented standard states and actions. Then, an event-triggered and state-driven autonomous control procedure is designed. By mapping vehicular relations in spatiotemporal domain into time-distance windows, a universal passing-through principle, rules, and priority-based scheduling mechanisms are proposed and described in detail. Finally, a priority scheduling algorithm sPriorFIFO is proposed and designed. These models and mechanisms are then implemented within an algorithm simulator, through which scheduling performances are verified and evaluated.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2015.2411619","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/7277123/07070682.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2015.2411619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7277123","startPage":"2487","endPage":"2500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"State-Driven Priority Scheduling Mechanisms for Driverless Vehicles Approaching Intersections","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7070682","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"State-Driven Priority Scheduling Mechanisms for Driverless Vehicles Approaching Intersections","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070682/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15475153","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7070682/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61103004"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"3102015JSJ0002"},{"fundingName":"postdoctoral Research Project of Foundation Franco-China for Science and Application","grantNumber":"FFCSA 2012"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"State-Driven Priority Scheduling Mechanisms for Driverless Vehicles Approaching Intersections","sourcePdf":"tits-zhang-2411619-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158884S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"7277123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7277123","articleId":"7070682","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7070685,"authors":[{"name":"Qingshan Liu","affiliation":["School of Automation, Key Laboratory of Image Processing and Intelligent Control, Ministry of Education, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Qingshan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37420537000"},{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280531600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"7070685","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":181,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3296},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Vectors","Linear programming","Equations","Neurodynamics","Recurrent neural networks","Convex functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous time systems","convex programming","directed graphs","Lyapunov methods","multi-agent systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Lyapunov method","dynamical system","undirected graph","convex objective function","bound-constrained distributed optimization","second-order multiagent network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Second-order multi-agent network","distributed optimization","consensus","Lyapunov function"]},{"kwd":["Consensus","distributed optimization","Lyapunov function","second-order multi-agent network"]}],"abstract":"This technical note presents a second-order multi-agent network for distributed optimization with a sum of convex objective functions subject to bound constraints.

Moreover, the consensus of the multi-agent network is converted to the convergence of a dynamical system, which is proved using the Lyapunov method. Compared with existing multi-agent networks for optimization, the second-order multi-agent network herein is capable of solving more general constrained distributed optimization problems.

To fully utilize the primary spectrum and maximize spectral efficiency, overlay and underlay transmissions, which exploit the white and gray spaces, respectively, should be used together. However, for underlay, the SUs need to transmit at low power to avoid causing harmful interference to the primary users (PUs), whereas the PUs will cause high interference to the SUs. Thus, interference mitigation is a major issue in underlay spectrum utilization. In this paper, a hybrid transmission system that exploits both overlay and underlay is proposed using multicarrier code-division multiple access due to its interference rejection and diversity exploitation capabilities. Unlike existing approaches, which separate the use of overlay and underlay spectrum, the proposed schemes utilize the entire spectrum for underlay transmission to minimize the PU interference while using the spectrum holes for overlay transmission to maximize the data rate. Two techniques that operate at full-load and overload scenarios are proposed. The overload system is then extended to the multiuser underlay case to further improve spectrum utilization.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7452700/07070686.pdf","startPage":"2038","endPage":"2047","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2417195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2417195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7452700","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7070686","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Overlay/Underlay Cognitive Radio Network With MC-CDMA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Vectors","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Receivers","Transmitters","Noise","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","cognitive radio","interference suppression","overlay networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underlay cognitive radio network","hybrid overlay network","MC-CDMA","secondary users","SU","primary spectrum","radio spectrum","primary users","PU","underlay spectrum utilization","multicarrier code-division multiple access","interference rejection","diversity exploitation capabilities","spectrum holes","full-load scenarios","overload scenarios"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio (CR)","Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)","Multi-Carrier Code Division Multiple Access (MC-CDMA)","overlay and underlay spectrum access"]},{"kwd":["Cognitive radio (CR)","multicarrier code-division multiple access (MC-CDMA)","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","overlay and underlay spectrum access"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070686/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Overlay/Underlay Cognitive Radio Network With MC-CDMA","volume":"65","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7070686/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15934406","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Overlay/Underlay Cognitive Radio Network With MC-CDMA","sourcePdf":"tvt-jasbi-2417195-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074254S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7452700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7452700","articleId":"7070686","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7070688,"authors":[{"name":"Mathew K.

The probabilistic path loss approach uses a free space line-of-sight propagation model, and for non-line-of-sight conditions uses either a close-in free space reference distance path loss model or a floating-intercept path loss model. The probabilistic model employs a weighting function that specifies the line-of-sight probability for a given transmitter-receiver separation distance. Results show that the probabilistic path loss model offers virtually identical results whether one uses a non-line-of-sight close-in free space reference distance path loss model, with a reference distance of 1 meter, or a floating-intercept path loss model.

Finally, we suggest spacecraft charging and ground effects mitigation strategies for design and operations of systems critical to our modern civilization.","doi":"10.1109/TPS.2015.2412775","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/27/7247791/07070693.pdf","startPage":"3086","endPage":"3098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247791","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPS.2015.2412775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Space Weather Threat to Situational Awareness, Communications, and Positioning Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7070693","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","displayDocTitle":"The Space Weather Threat to Situational Awareness, Communications, and Positioning Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070693/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15433020","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7070693/","volume":"43","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"The Space Weather Threat to Situational Awareness, Communications, and Positioning Systems","sourcePdf":"tps-ferguson-2412775-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075704S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"27","isNumber":"7247791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7247791","articleId":"7070693","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7070697,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Gao","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, and the Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Service Robot, Zhejiang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/7350319/7070697/gao-small.gif","p":["Yi Gao received the BS and PhD degrees in Zhejiang University in 2009\n and 2014, respectively.

Reconstructing the per-packet routing path enables fine-grained diagnostic analysis and performance optimizations of the network. The performances of existing path reconstruction approaches, however, degrade rapidly in large scale networks with lossy links. This paper presents Pathfinder, a robust path reconstruction method against packet losses as well as routing dynamics. At the node side, Pathfinder exploits temporal correlation between a set of packet paths and efficiently compresses the path information using path difference. At the sink side, Pathfinder infers packet paths from the compressed information and employs intelligent path speculation to reconstruct the packet paths with high reconstruction ratio. We propose a novel analytical model to analyze the performance of Pathfinder. We further evaluate Pathfinder compared with two most related approaches using traces from a large scale deployment and extensive simulations. Results show that Pathfinder outperforms existing approaches, achieving both high reconstruction ratio and low transmission cost.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2015.2417564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350319","startPage":"281","endPage":"293","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7350319/07070697.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Reconstructing Routing Paths in Large Scale Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070697/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7070697/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Towards Reconstructing Routing Paths in Large Scale Sensor Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15661718","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"65","issue":"1","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61472360"},{"fundingName":"Central Universities"},{"fundingName":"National Key Technology R&D Program","grantNumber":"2012BAI34B01"},{"fundingName":"Demonstration of Digital Medical Service and Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Reconstructing Routing Paths in Large Scale Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tc-gao-2417564-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090613S","chronDate":"Jan. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7350319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7350319","articleId":"7070697","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7070699,"authors":[{"name":"Jianwei Liao","affiliation":["College of Computer and Information Science, Southwest University of China, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245519/8024042/7070699/liao-2417560-small.gif","p":["Jianwei Liao received the MS degree in computer science from the\n University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2006 and PhD degree in computer science from the\n University of Tokyo, Japan in 2012.

In this prefetching technique, the client machines are not substantially involved in the process of data prefetching, but the storage servers can directly prefetch the data after analyzing the history of disk I/O access events, and then send the prefetched data to the relevant client machines proactively. To put this technique to work, the information about client nodes is piggybacked onto the real client I/O requests, and then forwarded to the relevant storage server. Next, two prediction algorithms have been proposed to forecast future block access operations for directing what data should be fetched on storage servers in advance. Finally, the prefetched data can be pushed to the relevant client machine from the storage server. Through a series of evaluation experiments with a collection of application benchmarks, we have demonstrated that our presented initiative prefetching technique can benefit distributed file systems for cloud environments to achieve better I/O performance. In particular, configuration-limited client machines in the cloud are not responsible for predicting I/O access operations, which can definitely contribute to preferable system performance on them.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245519/8024042/07070699.pdf","startPage":"550","endPage":"562","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCC.2015.2417560","doi":"10.1109/TCC.2015.2417560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8024042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performing Initiative Data Prefetching in Distributed File Systems for Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Performing Initiative Data Prefetching in Distributed File Systems for Cloud Computing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070699/","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7070699/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2017","publicationDate":"1 July-Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17169223","volume":"5","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept. 1 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61303038"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of CQ"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002865","fundingName":"CSTC","grantNumber":"CSTC2013JCYJA40050"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performing Initiative Data Prefetching in Distributed File Systems for Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"tcc-liao-2417560-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0945S","chronDate":"July-Sept. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"6245519","isNumber":"8024042","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245519","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8024042","articleId":"7070699","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"EU","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7070700,"authors":[{"name":"Donald Donglong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/7350319/7070700/chen-small.gif","p":["Donald Donglong Chen received the BEng degree in electronic and\n information engineering from Wuhan University of Technology in 2011.

Concurrent multipath transfer (CMT) using stream control transmission protocol (SCTP) exploits the multihoming feature of mobile devices to establish associations with different access networks. In this paper, we study the multihomed HD video communication with SCTP over heterogeneous wireless networks. The existing CMT schemes mainly treat the traffic data in a content-agnostic fashion, and thus cannot effectively leverage the scarce wireless resources to maximize the perceived video quality. To address this critical issue, we propose a content-aware CMT (CMT-CA) solution that featured by the unequal frame-level scheduling based on estimated video parameters and feedback channel status. First, we develop an analytical framework to model the total distortion of parallel video transmission over multiple wireless access networks. Second, we introduce a joint congestion control and data distribution scheme to minimize the total distortion based on online quality evaluation and Markov decision process (MDP). The performance of CMT-CA is evaluated through extensive semi-physical emulations in Exata involving HD video encoded with H.264 codec. Experimental results show that CMT-CA outperforms the reference schemes in terms of video peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), end-to-end delay, and goodput. Or conversely, CMT-CA achieves the same video quality with 20 percent bandwidth conservation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070701/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"27","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2016","accessionNumber":"15785689","htmlLink":"/document/7070701/","displayDocTitle":"Content-Aware Concurrent Multipath Transfer for High-Definition Video Streaming over Heterogeneous Wireless Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001321","fundingName":"National Research Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002761","fundingName":"Prime Minister's Office"},{"fundingName":"IDM"},{"fundingName":"Digital Media Programme Office"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Content-Aware Concurrent Multipath Transfer for High-Definition Video Streaming over Heterogeneous Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tpds-wu-2416736-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133122S","chronDate":"March 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"7403835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"7403835","articleId":"7070701","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7070703,"authors":[{"name":"Jae Hee Kim","affiliation":["Railroad Electric Traction and Wireless Power Transfer System Research Team, Korea Railroad Research Institute, Uiwang, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7247793/7070703/kim-2417122-small.gif","p":["\n\nJae Hee Kim (M'13) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 2005 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Korea, in 2010.","From 2010 to 2012, he was a Senior Engineer with Samsung Electronics, Suwon, Korea.

First, we analyze quad-tree CU depth decision process in HEVC and model it as a three-level of hierarchical binary decision problem. Second, a flexible CU depth decision structure is presented, which allows the performances of each CU depth decision be smoothly transferred between the coding complexity and RD performance. Then, a three-output joint classifier consists of multiple binary classifiers with different parameters is designed to control the risk of false prediction. Finally, a sophisticated RD-complexity model is derived to determine the optimal parameters for the joint classifier, which is capable of minimizing the complexity in each CU depth at given RD degradation constraints. Comparative experiments over various sequences show that the proposed CU depth decision algorithm can reduce the computational complexity from 28.82% to 70.93%, and 51.45% on average when compared with the original HEVC test model. The Bj\u00f8ntegaard delta peak signal-to-noise ratio and Bj\u00f8ntegaard delta bit rate are -0.061 dB and 1.98% on average, which is negligible. The overall performance of the proposed algorithm outperforms those of the state-of-the-art schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7070895/07070704.pdf","startPage":"2225","endPage":"2238","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2015.2417498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2015.2417498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7070895","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7070704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Machine Learning-Based Coding Unit Depth Decisions for Flexible Complexity Allocation in High Efficiency Video Coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Video coding","Support vector machines","Joints","Image coding","Classification algorithms","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary decision diagrams","communication complexity","decision theory","decision trees","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","quadtrees","rate distortion theory","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine learning","coding unit depth decision method","flexible complexity allocation","high efficiency video coding","HEVC","rate-distortion cost constraint","RD cost constraint","quadtree CU depth decision process","hierarchical binary decision problem","three-output joint classifier","multiple binary classifier","RD-complexity model","computational complexity","Bj\u00f8ntegaard delta peak signal-to-noise ratio","Bj\u00f8ntegaard delta bit rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High Efficiency Video Coding","Coding Unit","Machine Learning, Support Vector Machine"]},{"kwd":["High efficiency video coding","coding unit","machine learning","support vector machine"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070704/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Machine Learning-Based Coding Unit Depth Decisions for Flexible Complexity Allocation in High Efficiency Video Coding","volume":"24","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7070704/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15056185","pubMedId":"25826804","dateOfInsertion":"13 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471348, 61102088, 61272289 and 61202242"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Overseas High-Caliber Personnel Innovation and Entrepreneurship Project","grantNumber":"KQCX20140520154115027"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Emerging Industries of the Strategic Basic Research Project","grantNumber":"JCYJ20120617151719115"},{"fundingName":"100-Talents Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"Y434061V01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Machine Learning-Based Coding Unit Depth Decisions for Flexible Complexity Allocation in High Efficiency Video Coding","sourcePdf":"tip-zhang-2417498-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110855S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7070895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"7070895","articleId":"7070704","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7070706,"authors":[{"name":"Yanfeng Jiang","affiliation":["University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Yanfeng","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37310043600"},{"name":"Yang Lv","affiliation":["University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Lv","id":"37085484826"},{"name":"Mahdi Jamali","affiliation":["University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Jamali","id":"37085481875"},{"name":"Jian-Ping Wang","affiliation":["University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Jian-Ping","lastName":"Wang","id":"37310887900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"7070706","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":896},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7070706","abstract":"A spin-based analog-to-digital converter (ADC) using magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) is proposed in this letter.

Conventional Z-source breaker topologies do not provide steady-state overload protection and can only guard against extremely large transient faults. The Z-source breaker can be designed for considerations affecting both rate of fault current rise and absolute fault current level, analogous in some respects to a thermal-magnetic breaker. Detailed analysis and design equations are presented to provide a framework for sizing components in the Z-source breaker topology.

In particular, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) require scalable time synchronization for implementing distributed tasks on multiple sensor nodes. We propose an energy-efficient coefficient exchange synchronization protocol (CESP) based on a receiver-receiver synchronization scheme, which minimizes the impact of access-time delays. Most of the existing synchronization protocols focus on improving the synchronization accuracy by assuming the availability of packet-level timestamping and with little concern for power consumption. The proposed time-synchronization protocol achieves high synchronization accuracy similar to the classic reference broadcast synchronization (RBS) protocol without requiring packet-level timestamping but with a significant reduction on communication overhead to achieve low power consumption. CESP works in a fundamentally different way from RBS: In order to synchronize two receivers, RBS exchanges all beacon packets between two receivers, whereas CESP receivers first process a large number of received beacon packets and only then exchange a small amount of information between the two receivers: synchronization coefficients. The synchronization performance and power consumption are evaluated and compared with that of other well-known synchronization protocols through experimental results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7452700/07070715.pdf","startPage":"2387","endPage":"2396","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2417810","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2417810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7452700","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7070715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CESP: A Low-Power High-Accuracy Time Synchronization Protocol","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Protocols","Delays","Accuracy","Receivers","Wireless sensor networks","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protocols","synchronisation","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CESP","low-power high-accuracy time synchronization protocol","wireless sensor networks","WSN","energy-efficient coefficient exchange synchronization protocol","receiver-receiver synchronization scheme","access-time delays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","time synchronization algorithm and performance","drift and offset estimation"]},{"kwd":["Drift and offset estimation","time-synchronization algorithm and performance","wireless sensor networks (WSNs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070715/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"CESP: A Low-Power High-Accuracy Time Synchronization Protocol","volume":"65","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7070715/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15934399","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CESP: A Low-Power High-Accuracy Time Synchronization Protocol","sourcePdf":"tvt-gong-2417810-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085359S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7452700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7452700","articleId":"7070715","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7070716,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Moeng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Moeng","id":"37697658800"},{"name":"Haifeng Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Haifeng","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085340662"},{"name":"Rami Melhem","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Rami","lastName":"Melhem","id":"37085368511"},{"name":"Alex K.

Typically, GPU register files are quite large to accommodate many concurrent threads and are implemented using the same SRAM technology as the on-chip cache. We propose contextrf, a new register file architecture that efficiently leverages register files with nonuniform access characteristics, including hybrid SRAM/DRAM (S/D) and spintronic domain-wall memories (DWMs). Contextrf allows greater-capacity register files to be implemented in the same area within the GPU, with reduced power consumption. We also propose contextPreRF, a hardware preswitch scheme to hide switching delays-as soon as a register request is queued, the nonuniform access memories containing the corresponding register are sent a preemptive switch request. Thus, our scheme transparently hides the penalties of switching between register contexts. After replacing the register file SRAM with S/D, we can reduce energy by 37%, with a 1.4% average performance drop. Employing DWM, we reduce register file energy by 74%, with a 0.4% average performance penalty. For the denser DWM, we model converting the saved area into additional registers, cache, and shared memory-this improves performance by 13.5% over the baseline SRAM register file.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7365521","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7365521/07070716.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2397876","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2397876","startPage":"343","endPage":"347","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ContextPreRF: Enhancing the Performance and Energy of GPUs With Nonuniform Register Access","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070716/","displayDocTitle":"ContextPreRF: Enhancing the Performance and Energy of GPUs With Nonuniform Register Access","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7070716/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"15683855","dateOfInsertion":"24 December 2015","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000143","fundingName":"Division of Computing and Communication Foundations through the National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1064976, CNS-1012070 and EFRI-1038139"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ContextPreRF: Enhancing the Performance and Energy of GPUs With Nonuniform Register Access","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-moeng-2397876-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065351S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7365521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7365521","articleId":"7070716","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7070717,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Bi","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Microwave Imaging Technology, Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Bi","id":"37085531046"},{"name":"Chenglong Jiang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Microwave Imaging Technology, Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chenglong","lastName":"Jiang","id":"38236523700"},{"name":"Bingchen Zhang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Microwave Imaging Technology, Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bingchen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292024500"},{"name":"Zhengdao Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, College of Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhengdao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085539634"},{"name":"Wen Hong","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Microwave Imaging Technology, Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Hong","id":"37290656000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"7070717","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":452},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"abstract":"Matrix completion (MC) is a technique of reconstructing a low-rank matrix from a subset of matrix elements.

Compared with existing compressive sensing (CS)-based techniques, which are sensitive to noise and clutter, the proposed method reduces the false-alarm rate and achieves sparser change imaging, which is due to more available data offered by MC and our explicit consideration of clutter and additive noise in the imaging procedure. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated with experimental results based on raw radar data.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing

multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems in recent years. The applications of MIMO-SAR systems that involve high-resolution wide-swath remote sensing, 3-D imaging, and multi-baseline interferometry are seriously limited by the ambiguous energy introduced by the imperfect orthogonal waveforms. The ambiguous energy degrades SAR image severely, because it can be accumulated from closely spaced scatters. In order to suppress the ambiguous energy, the space-time coding (STC) scheme using the Alamouti technique has been proposed recently. However, this scheme is based on the assumption that the channel responses are constant within the consecutive transmissions. For the time-variant channel responses caused by motion errors or other factors, there will be residual ambiguous energy and \u201cghost targets.\u201d In this letter, a novel STC scheme suitable for MIMO-SAR systems is proposed. The performance of the proposed scheme is immune to the time-variant channel responses. Moreover, it can get more spatial diversities to enhance the MIMO SAR imaging applications. The proposed scheme is validated by numerical simulation results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Space\u2013Time Coding Scheme Used for MIMO-SAR Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience

The mode field distribution and dispersion property of this fiber was analyzed by finite-element method. Two LPFGs were fabricated with different periods of 230 and 250 \u03bcm, the resonant dips appeared at the wavelengths of 1325.8 and 1449.4 nm, respectively.

This paper investigates the power transfer efficiency of the WPT segment in future communication systems in support of simultaneous power and data transfer, by means of analytically computing the time-average output direct current (DC) power at user equipments (UEs). In order to investigate the effect of channel variety among UEs on the average output DC power, different policies for the scheduling of the power transfer among the users are implemented and compared in two scenarios: homogeneous, whereby users are symmetric and experience similar path loss, and heterogeneous, whereby users are asymmetric and exhibit different path losses. Specifically, if opportunistic scheduling is performed among N symmetric/asymmetric UEs, the power scaling laws are attained by using extreme value theory and reveal that the gain in power transfer efficiency is lnN if UEs are symmetric whereas the gain is N if UEs are asymmetric, compared with that of conventional round-robin scheduling. Thus, the channel variety among UEs inherent to the wireless environment can be exploited by opportunistic scheduling to significantly improve the power transfer efficiency when designing future wireless communication systems in support of simultaneous power and data transfer.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2417497","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2417497","startPage":"2835","endPage":"2847","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7089340/07070727.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7089340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Efficiency of Far-Field Wireless Power Transfer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070727/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June1,  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"On the Efficiency of Far-Field Wireless Power Transfer","volume":"63","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15106322","publicationDate":"June1, 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7070727/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":""}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Efficiency of Far-Field Wireless Power Transfer","sourcePdf":"tsp-xia-2417497-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133349S","chronDate":"June1,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7089340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"7089340","articleId":"7070727","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7070731,"authors":[{"name":"Xiwei Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiwei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37696599900"},{"name":"Tianping Chen","affiliation":["School of Computer Sciences/Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Tianping","lastName":"Chen","id":"37276683900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"7070731","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":188,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2233},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Couplings","Numerical simulation","Symmetric matrices","Trajectory","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","continuous time systems","differential equations","directed graphs","linear systems","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive algorithm","continuous-time ordinary differential equation","node dynamical behavior","aperiodically intermittent pinning control gain","complex network","synchronization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive control","aperiodic","intermittent pinning","synchronization"]},{"kwd":["Adaptive control","aperiodic","intermittent pinning","synchronization"]}],"abstract":"In this note, synchronization for linearly coupled network is investigated by pinning a simple aperiodically intermittent controller.

We first provide the rate-outage probability expressions for the three IMIMO systems and then propose methods to convert them into a tractable form and formulate the corresponding nonconvex optimization problems that can be solved by an interior-point algorithm for finding a local optimum. To reduce further the solution complexity, using an asymptotically equivalent approximation of the rate-outage probability expressions, we approximate the nonconvex optimization problems as a unified geometric programming problem (GPP), for which we derive the closed-form solution. Illustrative results indicate that the proposed power allocation (PPA) offers significant gains in energy savings as compared with the equal power allocation (EPA), and the simple closed-form GPP solution can provide closer performance to the exact method at lower values of rate-outage probability for the three IMIMO systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7452700/07070736.pdf","startPage":"2820","endPage":"2827","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2417500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2417500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7452700","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7070736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Adaptive Power Allocation for Incremental MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic repeat request","Optimization","Approximation methods","MIMO","Receivers","Resource management","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","concave programming","energy conservation","energy consumption","geometric programming","MIMO communication","minimisation","probability","redundancy","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["incremental MIMO system","energy-efficient adaptive power allocation","incremental multiple-input-multiple-output system","automatic repeat request","hybrid ARQ","HARQ","chase combining","CC","incremental redundancy","IR","rate-outage probability minimization","average energy consumption per data packet","IMIMO system","nonconvex optimization problem","interior-point algorithm","rate-outage probability expression asymptotically equivalent approximation","unified geometric programming problem","energy saving","unified GPP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Incremental MIMO","low-complexity MIMO","ARQ","HARQ","Chase combining","incremental redundancy","power allocation"]},{"kwd":["Automatic repeat request (ARQ)","Chase combining (CC)","hybrid ARQ (HARQ)","incremental multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (IMIMO)","incremental redundancy (IR)","low-complexity MIMO","power allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070736/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Adaptive Power Allocation for Incremental MIMO Systems","volume":"65","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7070736/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15934348","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Adaptive Power Allocation for Incremental MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-tumula-2417500-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0894S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7452700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7452700","articleId":"7070736","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7070737,"authors":[{"name":"Sinan Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7283717/7070737/li-small.gif","p":["Sinan Li (M'14) was born in China in 1986.

The receiver consists of eight data lanes plus one forwarded-clock lane supporting the hypertransport standard for high-density chip-to-chip links. The proposed all-digital clock and data recovery (ADCDR) circuit, which is well suited for today's CMOS process scaling, enables the receiver to achieve low power and area consumption. The ADCDR can enter into open loop after lock-in to save power and avoid clock dithering phenomenon. Moreover, to compensate the open loop, a phase tracking procedure is proposed to enable the ADCDR to track the phase drift due to the voltage and temperature variations. Furthermore, the all-digital delay-locked loop circuit integrated in the ADCDR can generate accurate multiphase clocks with the proposed calibrated locking algorithm in the presence of process variations. The precise multiphase clocks are essential for the half-rate sampling and Alexander-type phase detecting. Measurement results show that the receiver can operate at a data rate of 6.4 Gbits/s with a bit error rate <;10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-12</sup>\n, consuming 7.5-mW per lane (1.2 pJ/bit) under a 0.85 V power supply.

As an emerging computational paradigm, an inexact circuit offers a promising approach to significantly reduce both dynamic and static power dissipation for error-tolerant applications. In this paper, an inexact floating-point adder is proposed by approximately designing an exponent subtractor and mantissa adder. Related operations such as normalization and rounding are also dealt with in terms of inexact computing. An upper bound error analysis for the average case is presented to guide the inexact design; it shows that the inexact floating-point adder design is dependent on the application data range. High dynamic range images are then processed using the proposed inexact floating-point adders to show the validity of the inexact design; comparison results show that the proposed inexact floating-point adders can improve the power consumption and power-delay product by 29.98 and 39.60 percent, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2015.2417549","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7350319/07070739.pdf","startPage":"308","endPage":"314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2015.2417549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Analysis of Inexact Floating-Point Adders","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070739/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"Design and Analysis of Inexact Floating-Point Adders","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7070739/","accessionNumber":"15661725","volume":"65","issue":"1","publicationDate":"1 Jan. 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401197"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Analysis of Inexact Floating-Point Adders","sourcePdf":"tc-liu-2417549-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072309S","chronDate":"Jan. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7350319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7350319","articleId":"7070739","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7070741,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Zhao","affiliation":["Video and Image Processing System (VIPS) Laboratory, School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7330076/7070741/zhao-2411287-small.gif","p":["Lin Zhao received the B.Eng. degree in electronic information engineering from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2010.

The technology of pose estimation is typically applied, but it ignores the temporal context and cannot provide smooth, reliable tracking results. Therefore, we develop a tracking and estimation integrated model (TEIM) to fully exploit temporal information by integrating pose estimation with visual tracking. However, joint parsing of multiple articulated parts over time is difficult, because a full model with edges capturing all pairwise relationships within and between frames is loopy and intractable. In previous models, approximate inference was usually resorted to, but it cannot promise good results and the computational cost is large. We overcome these problems by exploring the idea of divide and conquer, which decomposes the full model into two much simpler tractable submodels. In addition, a novel two-step iteration strategy is proposed to efficiently conquer the joint parsing problem. Algorithmically, we design TEIM very carefully so that: 1) it enables pose estimation and visual tracking to compensate for each other to achieve desirable tracking results; 2) it is able to deal with the problem of tracking loss; and 3) it only needs past information and is capable of tracking online. Experiments are conducted on two public data sets in the wild with ground truth layout annotations, and the experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed TEIM framework.","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7330076/07070741.pdf","startPage":"3176","endPage":"3186","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7330076","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2411287","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2411287","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7070741","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Tracking","Hidden Markov models","Visualization","Joints","Graphical models","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["divide and conquer methods","iterative methods","object tracking","pose estimation","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tracking and estimation integrated graphical model","2D human pose tracking","video stream","body parts spatial configuration","pose estimation","TEIM","visual tracking","divide and conquer","tractable submodels","two-step iteration strategy","joint parsing problem","tracking loss"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pictorial structure (PS)","pose estimation","pose tracking","visual tracking."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Learning","Models, Theoretical","Movement","Neural Networks (Computer)","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Posture","Video Recording","Whole Body Imaging"]},{"kwd":["Pictorial structure (PS)","pose estimation","pose tracking","visual tracking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070741/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Learning a Tracking and Estimation Integrated Graphical Model for Human Pose Tracking","accessionNumber":"15602378","pubMedId":"25826809","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7070741/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"26","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61125204, 61432014, 61172146 and 61125106"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"BDZ021403 and JB149901"},{"fundingName":"Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University of China","grantNumber":"IRT13088"},{"fundingName":"Shaanxi Innovative Research Team for Key Science and Technology","grantNumber":"2012KCT-02"},{"fundingName":"Australian Research Council Projects FT-130101457, DP-140102164 and DP-120103730"},{"fundingName":"Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"KGZD-EW-T03"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning a Tracking and Estimation Integrated Graphical Model for Human Pose Tracking","sourcePdf":"tnnls-li-2411287-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105993S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7330076","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7330076","articleId":"7070741","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7070745,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Fajar Firdaus","affiliation":["Al Hosn Gas, United Arab Emirates"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/7350319/7070745/firda-small.gif","p":["Ahmad Fajar Firdaus (M'12) received the BEng degree in\n electrical and electronics engineering from the Institute Teknologi Bandung (ITB), Indonesia, in 2010 and the MSc\n degree in electrical engineering from the Petroleum Institute in 2012.

It is modular and consists of a front-end module which performs precise capacitance measurements in a time multiplexed manner using Capacitance to Digital Converter (CDC) technique. Another FPGA module performs the inverse steps of the tomography algorithm. A dual port built-in memory banks store the sensitivity matrix, the actual value of the capacitances, and the actual image. A two dimensional (2D) core multi-processing elements (PE) engine inter-communicates with these memory banks via parallel buses. A Hardware-software codesign methodology was conducted using commercially available tools in order to concurrently tune the algorithms and hardware parameters. Hence, the hardware was designed down to the bit-level in order to reduce both the hardware cost and power consumption, while satisfying real-time constraint. Quantization errors were assessed against the image quality and bit-level simulations demonstrate the correctness of the design. Further simulations indicate that the proposed architecture achieves a speed-up of up to three orders of magnitude over the software version when the reconstruction algorithm runs on 2.53 GHz-based Pentium processor or DSP Ti's Delphino TMS320F32837 processor. More specifically, a throughput of 17.241 Kframes/sec for both the Linear-Back Projection (LBP) and modified Landweber algorithms and 8.475 Kframes/sec for the Landweber algorithm with 200 iterations could be achieved. This performance was achieved using an array of [2 x 2] x [2 x 2] processing units. This satisfies the real-time constraint of many industrial applications. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first embedded system which explores the intrinsic parallelism which is available in modern FPGA for ECT tomography.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Parallel VLSI Architecture for Real-Time Electrical Capacitance Tomography","doi":"10.1109/TC.2015.2417538","startPage":"30","endPage":"41","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2015.2417538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350319","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7350319/07070745.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7070745","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070745/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"A New Parallel VLSI Architecture for Real-Time Electrical Capacitance Tomography","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"65","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7070745/","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15661727","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Parallel VLSI Architecture for Real-Time Electrical Capacitance Tomography","sourcePdf":"tc-meribout-2417538-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067521S","chronDate":"Jan. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7350319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7350319","articleId":"7070745","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7070748,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenkun Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of the Ministry of Education of China, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7381705/7070748/wang-2403849-small.gif","p":["Zhenkun Wang was born in Shandong, China, in 1990.

This paper proposes a global replacement scheme which assigns a new solution to its most suitable subproblems.

However, how to protect customers confidential data processed and generated during the computation is becoming the major security concern. Focusing on engineering computing and optimization tasks, this paper investigates secure outsourcing of widely applicable linear programming (LP) computations. Our mechanism design explicitly decomposes LP computation outsourcing into public LP solvers running on the cloud and private LP parameters owned by the customer. The resulting flexibility allows us to explore appropriate security/efficiency tradeoff via higher-level abstraction of LP computation than the general circuit representation. Specifically, by formulating private LP problem as a set of matrices/vectors, we develop efficient privacy-preserving problem transformation techniques, which allow customers to transform the original LP into some random one while protecting sensitive input/output information. To validate the computation result, we further explore the fundamental duality theorem of LP and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions that correct results must satisfy. Such result verification mechanism is very efficient and incurs close-to-zero additional cost on both cloud server and customers. Extensive security analysis and experiment results show the immediate practicability of our mechanism design.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7350319/07070751.pdf","startPage":"216","endPage":"229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Optimization Computation Outsourcing in Cloud Computing: A Case Study of Linear Programming","doi":"10.1109/TC.2015.2417542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350319","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2015.2417542","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7070751","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070751/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"Secure Optimization Computation Outsourcing in Cloud Computing: A Case Study of Linear Programming","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2015","publicationDate":"1 Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15661729","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"65","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7070751/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"US National Science foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1262277 and CNS-1116939"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002920","fundingName":"RGC","grantNumber":"CityU 138513"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007567","fundingName":"CityU of Hong Kong","grantNumber":"7200320"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Optimization Computation Outsourcing in Cloud Computing: A Case Study of Linear Programming","sourcePdf":"tc-ren-2417542-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107369S","chronDate":"Jan. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7350319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"7350319","articleId":"7070751","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7070752,"authors":[{"name":"Kisong Lee","affiliation":["Department of Information and Telecommunication Engineering, Kunsan National University, Gunsan, Korea"],"firstName":"Kisong","lastName":"Lee","id":"37717285200"},{"name":"Jun-Pyo Hong","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Pukyoung National University, Busan, Korea"],"firstName":"Jun-Pyo","lastName":"Hong","id":"37534485000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"7070752","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":967},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"Energy harvesting (EH) from background radio-frequency signals has recently started to be considered as a promising means of mitigating energy deficiencies in wireless sensors that have limited battery power. In this paper, to deal with the problem of energy shortage, we consider EH and energy efficiency, which is the ratio of the amount of data transferred to the energy dissipated within the system, at the same time. We formulate a nonconvex optimization problem for determining the training interval for channel estimation, user scheduling, and power allocation strategies to maximize the energy efficiency and transform the problem into a tractable convex problem. Based on the convexity of the problem, we propose an energy-efficient resource allocation strategy using an iterative method and provide the convergence of the proposed algorithm based on nonlinear fractional programming. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm operates in an energy-efficient way, thereby achieving maximum energy efficiency while ensuring the data rate and harvested energy requirements.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7452700/07070752.pdf","startPage":"2775","endPage":"2780","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2416754","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2416754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7452700","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7070752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for Simultaneous Information and Energy Transfer With Imperfect Channel Estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Training","Channel estimation","Data communication","Wireless communication","Optimization","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","energy harvesting","mathematical programming","nonlinear programming","telecommunication power management","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harvested energy requirements","nonlinear fractional programming","channel estimation","nonconvex optimization problem","limited battery power","wireless sensors","background radio frequency signals","EH","energy harvesting","imperfect channel estimation","energy transfer","energy efficient resource allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy efficiency,","energy harvesting","channel estimation","optimization","resource allocation"]},{"kwd":["Channel estimation","energy efficiency","energy harvesting (EH)","optimization","resource allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070752/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for Simultaneous Information and Energy Transfer With Imperfect Channel Estimation","volume":"65","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7070752/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15934397","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for Simultaneous Information and Energy Transfer With Imperfect Channel Estimation","sourcePdf":"tvt-hong-2416754-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0665S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7452700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7452700","articleId":"7070752","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7070753,"authors":[{"name":"Georgios Konstantinou","affiliation":["Australian Energy Research Institute, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/7389461/7070753/7070753-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Georgios Konstantinou (S'08\u2013M'13) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the UNSW Australia (The University of New South Wales), Sydney, Australia, in 2012.","Currently, he is a Senior Research Associate with the Australian Energy Research Institute (AERI) and the School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, UNSW Australia.

A scheduler observes the random channel conditions that each control system experiences over the shared medium and opportunistically selects systems to transmit at a set of non-overlapping frequencies. The transmit power of each system also adapts to channel conditions and determines the probability of successfully receiving and closing the loop. We formulate the optimal design of channel-aware scheduling and power allocation that minimize the total power consumption while meeting control performance requirements for all systems. In particular, it is required that for each control system a given Lyapunov function decreases at a specified rate in expectation over the random channel conditions. We develop an offline algorithm to find the optimal communication design, as well as an online protocol which selects scheduling and power variables based on a random observed channel sequence and converges almost surely to the optimal operating point. Simulations illustrate the power savings of our approach compared to other non-channel-aware schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2015.2416922","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/9/7342868/07070754.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7342868","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2015.2416922","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","startPage":"3140","endPage":"3155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Control Over Shared Wireless Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7070754","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Control Over Shared Wireless Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070754/","volume":"60","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7070754/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15647727","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-0931239"},{"fundingName":"TerraSwarm"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Control Over Shared Wireless Channels","sourcePdf":"tac-gatsis-2416922-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108284S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"7342868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"7342868","articleId":"7070754","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7070756,"authors":[{"name":"Ishwar Bhati","affiliation":["Oracle, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/7350319/7070756/bhati-small.gif","p":["Ishwar Bhati received BTech degree in electronics and communication\n engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India, in 2005, and the MS and PhD degrees in computer\n engineering from University of Maryland, College Park, MD, in 2013 and 2014, respectively.

DRAM has been the technology choice for main memory due to its low latency and high density. However, DRAM cells must be refreshed periodically to preserve their content. Refresh operations negatively affect performance and power. Traditionally, the performance and power overhead of refresh have been insignificant. But as the size and speed of DRAM chips continue to increase, refresh becomes a dominating factor of DRAM performance and power dissipation. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of the issues related to refresh operations in modern DRAMs. Specifically, we describe the difference in refresh operations between modern synchronous DRAM and traditional asynchronous DRAM; the refresh modes and timings; and variations in data retention time. Moreover, we quantify refresh penalties versus device speed, size, and total memory capacity. We also categorize refresh mechanisms based on command granularity, and summarize refresh techniques proposed in research papers. Finally, based on our experiments and observations, we propose guidelines for mitigating DRAM refresh penalties.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2015.2417540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350319","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2015.2417540","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7350319/07070756.pdf","startPage":"108","endPage":"121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DRAM Refresh Mechanisms, Penalties, and Trade-Offs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"DRAM Refresh Mechanisms, Penalties, and Trade-Offs","volume":"65","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 1 2016","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7070756/","publicationDate":"1 Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15661730","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070756/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Intel Corporate Research Council's University Research Office"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000015","fundingName":"United State Department of Energy"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006234","fundingName":"Sandia National Laboratories"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000005","fundingName":"United States Department of Defense"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DRAM Refresh Mechanisms, Penalties, and Trade-Offs","sourcePdf":"tc-bhati-2417540-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.198775S","chronDate":"Jan. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7350319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"7350319","articleId":"7070756","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7070762,"authors":[{"name":"Naifeng Jing","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, and Department of Micro-Nano Electronics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/7350319/7070762/jing-small.gif","p":["Naifeng Jing received the BE, ME, and PhD degrees from Shanghai Jiao\n Tong University, China, in 2005, 2008, and 2012, respectively.

However, the fast increasing size of the on-chip storage based on traditional SRAM cells, such as register file (RF), shared memory and first level data (L1D) cache, makes the area cost and energy consumption unsustainable for future GPGPUs. In this paper, we first propose to use the embedded-DRAM (eDRAM) as an alternative for the on-chip storage. Compared to the conventional SRAM, eDRAM enables higher density and lower leakage power, but suffers from limited data retention time. Periodic refresh operation is a viable approach to maintain data integrity but aggravates the performance and energy consumption with the scaling of eDRAM cells into deep sub-micron technology nodes. To recover the performance loss, we exploit the features in the GPGPU architecture and propose various novel refresh schemes to mitigate the refresh penalty. To improve the energy efficiency, we apply lightweight compiler techniques and runtime monitoring for selective refreshing that intelligently eliminate the unnecessary refreshes. The evaluation on our proposed refresh schemes demonstrates that, comparing to the conventional SRAM-based designs, our eDRAM-based on-chip storage exhibits comparable performance but less energy consumption and smaller silicon area, enabling the sustainable on-chip storage scaling for even higher parallelism in future GPGPUs.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2015.2417545","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2015.2417545","startPage":"122","endPage":"135","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7350319/07070762.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient eDRAM-Based On-Chip Storage Architecture for GPGPUs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070762/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient eDRAM-Based On-Chip Storage Architecture for GPGPUs","volume":"65","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15661731","publicationDate":"1 Jan. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7070762/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61402285, 61202026 and 61332001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2013M540362 and 2014T70418"},{"fundingName":"Program of China National 1,000 Young Talent Plan"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient eDRAM-Based On-Chip Storage Architecture for GPGPUs","sourcePdf":"tc-jing-2417545-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12101S","chronDate":"Jan. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7350319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7350319","articleId":"7070762","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7070773,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Due to severe cochannel interference (CoI) in multipath rich underwater channels, no more than 4 users have been demonstrated. Multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) communication also allows multiple users. Using parallel/sequential interference cancellation schemes, experimental results show similar limitations on the number of users. To extend the number of users beyond four (as required for certain applications), it is proposed to combine CDMA with MIMO, utilizing the spatial-temporal processing gain of passive-phase conjugation, and the approximate-orthogonality of the spreading codes to remove the (increased) CoI. The receiver algorithm uses simple matched filters without explicit channel-equalization and CoI cancellation. The algorithm performance is studied as a function of input-SNR, using simulated data based on experimentally measured channel impulse responses. M-sequences with 127, 255 and 511 chips are used. One finds that 255/511 chips are generally required to support 8 users, and 127/255 chips are needed to support 6 users for the channel studied. Multiuser communications are demonstrated with at-sea data for 8 users, with spreading codes of 511 chips, yielding zero bit errors. The data rate is ~ 8 bits/s/user, given 4 kHz bandwidth.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic

(PAPR). However, in this letter our analysis shows that actually the CM is still inaccurate to predict the required PA power de-rating that satisfies the out-of-band radiation (OBR) requirement of a communication system. Further, by investigating the effect of the third-order nonlinearity of PA on the OBR, we propose a novel metric. Compared with PAPR and CM, the proposed metric has a strong correlation with the OBR, and thus it provides much higher accuracy in determining the required power de-rating of PAs, which is verified by extensive experimental results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070774/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7070774/","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15108272","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A High-Accuracy Metric for Predicting the Power De-Rating of RF Power Amplifiers","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":""}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Accuracy Metric for Predicting the Power De-Rating of RF Power Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"lmwc-zhang-2409983-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042001S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"7102797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7102797","articleId":"7070774","onlineDate":"27 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7070776,"authors":[{"name":"Haikun Jia","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Institute of Microelectronics, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7101309/7070776/7070776-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haikun Jia (S\u201913) received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2009, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.","His research interests are in the field of millimeter-wave circuit and system design, including power amplifiers (PAs), voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), and frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar."]},"firstName":"Haikun","lastName":"Jia","id":"37072383800"},{"name":"Baoyong Chi","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Institute of Microelectronics, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7101309/7070776/7070776-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Baoyong Chi (M\u201908) received the B.S. degree in microelectronics from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 1998, and the Ph.D. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2003.","From 2006 to 2007, he was a Visiting Assistant Professor with Stanford University.

While the method is generally applicable to any switching converter operating in the discontinuous conduction mode, it is extensively illustrated for the three common power stages (buck, boost, and buck-boost). The results for these converters are then easily tabulated owing to the fixed equivalent circuit topology of their canonical circuit model. The outlined method lends itself easily to investigation of the discontinuous conduction mode in more complex structures (cascade connection of buck and boost converters, for example), in which more thean one inductor current may become discontinuous. As opposed to other modelling techniques, the new method considers the discontinuous conduction mode as a special case of the continuous conduction mode.","displayPublicationTitle":"1977 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7065148/7065149/07070802.pdf","startPage":"36","endPage":"57","publicationTitle":"1977 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1977.7070802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1977.7070802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7065149","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7070802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A general unified approach to modelling switching DC-tO-DC converters in discontinuous conduction mode","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","Mathematical model","Switches","Inductors","Equations","Switching converters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070802/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 June 1977","displayDocTitle":"A general unified approach to modelling switching DC-tO-DC converters in discontinuous conduction mode","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 1977","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"14-16 June 1977","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A general unified approach to modelling switching DC-tO-DC converters in discontinuous conduction mode","confLoc":"Palo Alto, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"036057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022784S","chronDate":"14-16 June 1977","isNumber":"7065149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7065148","citationCount":"169","articleId":"7070802","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7070804,"authors":[{"name":"William W.

As part of this model, the Error Compensation Unit (ECU) is identified as a key building block for a wide range of AAAC circuits. We develop theoretical analysis geared towards addressing two critical design problems of the ECU, namely, determination of optimal error compensation values and identification of the optimal error compensation scheme. We demonstrate how this general AAAC model can be leveraged to derive practical design insights that lead to optimal tradeoffs between accuracy, energy dissipation and area overhead. To further minimize energy consumption, delay and area of AAAC circuits, we perform ECU design simplification by introducing logic don't cares. By applying this model and using a commercial 90 nm CMOS standard cell library, we propose an approximate 16 \u00d7 16 fixed-width Booth multiplier that consumes 44.85% and 28.33% less energy and area compared with theoretically the most accurate fixed-width Booth multiplier. Furthermore, it reduces average error, max error and mean squared error by 11.11%, 28.11%, and 25.00%, respectively, when compared with the most accurate reported approximate Booth multiplier and outperforms the same design significantly by 19.10% for the energy-delay-mean squared error product. Using the same approach, significant energy consumption, area and error reduction is achieved for a squarer unit.

We introduce a new metric, namely, node usage probability, for characterizing the traffic load distribution and how frequently a node is chosen to relay packets in a network. Based on the concept of node usage probability, effective network design strategies, including routing algorithms and resource allocation schemes, can be developed to improve the overall traffic performance. We compare the performance of a minimum-node-usage routing algorithm with that based on other popular routing algorithms, such as shortest path (SP) and minimum degree (MD) routing algorithms, for various network topologies and resource allocation schemes. Simulation results show that routing algorithms based on minimizing node usage (MNU) can effectively balance traffic loads and resource allocation based on the node usage probability outperforms the uniform and degree-based allocation schemes. Our analysis and simulation results provide insights into how networks should be designed, including the choice of topology, the routing method, and the resource allocation scheme, for achieving optimal network performance.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2015.2399024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7070848","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2015.2399024","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7070848/07070865.pdf","startPage":"1195","endPage":"1204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concept of Node Usage Probability From Complex Networks and Its Applications to Communication Network Design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Concept of Node Usage Probability From Complex Networks and Its Applications to Communication Network Design","volume":"62","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7070865/","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15019676","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070865/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concept of Node Usage Probability From Complex Networks and Its Applications to Communication Network Design","sourcePdf":"tcsi-tse-2399024-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093907S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7070848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7070848","articleId":"7070865","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7070867,"authors":[{"name":"Lucas G. de Carli","affiliation":["Marinha do Brasil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7070848/7070867/7070867-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lucas G. de Carli received his B.E. degree in electrical engineering at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), Brazil, in 2013.

In such applications, there is an increasing emphasis on inference functions. Machine-learning algorithms play an important role by enabling the construction of data-driven models for inference over data that is too complex to model analytically. This paper explores how data-driven training can be exploited to also overcome computational errors due to hardware faults within an inference stage. FPGA emulation with randomized fault injections shows that the proposed architecture restores system performance to the level of a fault free system, with 1% of the hardware requiring explicit fault protection, and with digital faults affecting >2% of the circuit nodes in the rest of the hardware. To train an error-aware inference model, a training algorithm is presented whose hardware (memory) and energy requirements are reduced by 65 \u00d7 and 10 \u00d7 compared to previously reported algorithms (AdaBoost and FilterBoost respectively), thereby enabling model construction entirely on the device.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2015.2395591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7070848","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2015.2395591","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7070848/07070874.pdf","startPage":"1136","endPage":"1145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error Adaptive Classifier Boosting (EACB): Leveraging Data-Driven Training Towards Hardware Resilience for Signal Inference","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2015","displayDocTitle":"Error Adaptive Classifier Boosting (EACB): Leveraging Data-Driven Training Towards Hardware Resilience for Signal Inference","volume":"62","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7070874/","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15019699","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070874/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Adaptive Classifier Boosting (EACB): Leveraging Data-Driven Training Towards Hardware Resilience for Signal Inference","sourcePdf":"tcsi-wang-2395591-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082551S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7070848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7070848","articleId":"7070874","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7070877,"authors":[{"name":"Lucia Valentina Gambuzza","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica Elettronica e Informatica, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Catania, Catania, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7070848/7070877/7070877-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lucia Valentina Gambuzza graduated in Automation and Control of Complex Systems Engineering in 2010 at the University of Catania, Italy, and then received the Ph.D. in Systems Engineering in 2014.

The switched-capacitor voltage regulator is a suitable candidate as capacitors may be integrated whereas inductors still suffer limitations in that respect. Literature covers proposals of optimized power stages and several dedicated controllers for switched-capacitor DC-DC converters. Unfortunately the results do not cover systematic stability analyses. The paper proposes an original and systematic approach for the stability analysis of a switched-capacitor voltage regulator using sampled-data modeling. An application is given for a one-phase converter with a frequency-modulation based controller. The stability of the open-loop and closed-loop model is proposed and can be extended to multi-phase configurations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070878/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7070878/","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15019691","volume":"62","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Sampled-Data Modeling of Switched- Capacitor Voltage Regulator With Frequency-Modulation Control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampled-Data Modeling of Switched- Capacitor Voltage Regulator With Frequency-Modulation Control","sourcePdf":"tcsi-souvignet-2399025-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07973S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7070848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7070848","articleId":"7070878","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7070880,"authors":[{"name":"Ding Nie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7070848/7070880/7070880-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ding Nie was born in Nanchang, Jiangxi, China.

When there are multiple coupled loads being driven by multiple independent sources, the notion of a single reflection coefficient is not obvious since energy delivered to one load port may reflect, in part, out another port. Establishing the maximum possible bandwidth of the matching network and loads requires the development of a broadband matching theory that applies to coupled systems. We define a bandwidth measure for coupled loads based on the integral logarithm of their collective power reflection, and develop upper bounds on this measure. These upper bounds can be used to examine the effects of coupling on bandwidth, and to evaluate the broadband performance of matching networks for an arbitrary number of coupled loads.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070880/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2015","volume":"62","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"15019681","publicationDate":"April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7070880/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Broadband Matching Bounds for Coupled Loads","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadband Matching Bounds for Coupled Loads","sourcePdf":"tcsi-nie-2399026-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076453S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7070848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7070848","articleId":"7070880","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7070883,"authors":[{"name":"Moslem Nouri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7070848/7070883/7070883-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Moslem Nouri received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Azad University, Kermanshah, Iran, in 2012, and the M.Sc. degree in electronic engineering from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran, in 2014 (with Honors), where he is currently a Ph.D. student of electronic engineering, Razi University.","His research interests include high-frequency high-efficiency power amplifiers and oscillators, resonant dc/dc power converters, numerical simulation of switching circuits, analog and digital electronic circuit design and optimization, bio-inspired computing, neuromorphic, artificial cochlear, and integrated circuit design."]},"firstName":"Moslem","lastName":"Nouri","id":"37085470031"},{"name":"Arash Ahmadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7070848/7070883/7070883-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Arash Ahmadi (M'04) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electronics engineering from Sharif University of Technology and Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran, in 1993 and 1997, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electronics from the University of Southampton, U.K., in 2008.","He was with Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran, as a Faculty Member.

Evidently, response of the cochlea is essentially nonlinear, where it operates within Hopf bifurcation boundaries to maximize tuning and amplification. This paper presents a set of piecewise linear (PWL) and multiplierless piecewise linear (MLPWL1 and MLPWL2) active cochlear models, which mimic a range of behaviors, similar to the biological cochlea. These proposed models show similar dynamical characteristics of the Hopf equation for the active nonlinear artificial cochlea. Accordingly, a compact model structure is proposed upon which a 2-D cochlea is developed. The proposed models are investigated, in terms of their digital realization and hardware cost, targeting large scale implementation. Hardware synthesis and physical implementation on a FPGA show that the proposed models can reproduce precise active cochlea behaviors with higher performance and considerably lower computational costs in comparison with the original model. Results indicate that the MLPWL1 model has a lower computational overhead, precision, and hardware cost, while the PWL model has a higher precision and dynamically tracks the original model. On the other hand, the MLPWL2 model outperforms the others in terms of accuracy, dynamical tracking of the original model and implementation cost. The gain variations of the original, PWL, MLPWL1, and MLPWL2 models are 230, 100, 105, and 230 dB, respectively. The mean normalized root mean square errors (NRMSEs) of the PWL, MLPWL1, and MLPWL2 models are 0.11%, 11.97%, and 0.34%, respectively, as compared to the original cochlear model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070883/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7070883/","accessionNumber":"15019698","displayDocTitle":"A Hopf Resonator for 2-D Artificial Cochlea: Piecewise Linear Model and Digital Implementation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hopf Resonator for 2-D Artificial Cochlea: Piecewise Linear Model and Digital Implementation","sourcePdf":"tcsi-ahmadi-2390555-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159842S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7070848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7070848","articleId":"7070883","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7070885,"authors":[{"name":"Alon Ascoli","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Grundlagen der Elektrotechnik und Elektronik, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Deutschland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7070848/7070885/7070885-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alon Ascoli received a Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from University College Dublin, Ireland, in 2006.

Through application of techniques from the theory of nonlinear dynamics to an accurate and simple mathematical model for the device, we gained a deep insight into the mechanisms at the origin of the emergence of local activity in the memristor. This theoretical study sets a general constraint on the biasing arrangement for the stabilization of the negative differential resistance effect in locally active memristors and provides a theoretical justification for an unexplained phenomenon observed at HP labs. As proof-of-principle, the constraint was used to enable a memristor to induce sustained oscillations in a one port cell. The capability of the oscillatory cell to amplify infinitesimal fluctuations of energy was theoretically and experimentally proved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070885/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","volume":"62","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15019694","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7070885/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Dynamics of a Locally-Active Memristor","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001824","fundingName":"Czech Science Foundation","grantNumber":"14-19865S"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Dynamics of a Locally-Active Memristor","sourcePdf":"tcsi-ascoli-2413152-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105911S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7070848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"7070848","articleId":"7070885","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7070886,"authors":[{"name":"Chak-Fong Cheang","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Macao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7070848/7070886/7070886-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chak-Fong Cheang (S'13) received his B.Sc. and his M.Sc. degree in the Department of Engineering Science, National Cheng Kung University (NCKU), Tainan, Taiwan, in 2008, 2010.

For the TX to cover a 10x-wide bandwidth, the DPD implements a modified dynamic deviation reduction (DDR)-based Volterra series to jointly nullify the frequency-dependent I/Q imbalance, counter-intermodulation (CIM) of mixers, and nonlinearities of power amplifier (PA) with memory effect. The interactions of those impairments are firstly analyzed using two Volterra series. After applying the tandem properties of Volterra series, interactions of all impairments can be described in one Volterra series by bonding those impairments in parallel. Coefficients of the DPD are extracted with the LeastSquare (LS) estimator, achieving lower running complexity than the existing DPDs, which were developed to handle the PA nonlinearities only. Verifications are based on both system-level simulations and silicon measurements of a 65-nm CMOS TX prototype.

At a remarkably low input power of -20.5 dBm (8.9 \u03bcW) for a 1 M \u03a9 load, the rectifier produces an output voltage of 1 V.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2015.2413153","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2015.2413153","startPage":"948","endPage":"956","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7070848/07070892.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7070848","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 3.2 V \u201315 dBm Adaptive Threshold-Voltage Compensated RF Energy Harvester in 130 nm CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070892/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2015","displayDocTitle":"A 3.2 V \u201315 dBm Adaptive Threshold-Voltage Compensated RF Energy Harvester in 130 nm CMOS","volume":"62","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15019700","publicationDate":"April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7070892/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 3.2 V \u201315 dBm Adaptive Threshold-Voltage Compensated RF Energy Harvester in 130 nm CMOS","sourcePdf":"tcsi-hameed-2413153-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138384S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7070848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"7070848","articleId":"7070892","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7070899,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7070848/7070899/7070899-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peng Chen received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, in 2009, where he continued studying for his M.S. degree during the following two years.

Comparing with the inverse class-E power amplifier at nominal condition, which demands both zero-current-switching (ZCS) and zero-current-derivative-switching (ZCDS) conditions simultaneously, the presented inverse class-E power amplifier at sub-nominal condition is only restricted by the ZCS condition. The proposed power amplifier increases two design parameters because the ZCDS condition limitation is cancelled and the duty ratio can be arbitrarily set. The analytical results demonstrate that the theoretical drain efficiency is still 100% and that all the circuit elements can be adjusted by the two released parameters. Furthermore, the influences of the transistor's parasitic switch-on resistor and output capacitor are investigated and a simulation example is given to verify the proposed design methodology's accuracy. Although it is not sufficiently tolerant of the elements mismatches and the transistor's parasitic capacitor in practical design, the inverse class-E power amplifier at sub-nominal condition is still one of the promising candidates for high-efficiency power amplifier design if the two drawbacks are appropriately averted.","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7070848/07070899.pdf","startPage":"1015","endPage":"1024","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7070848","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2015.2390557","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2015.2390557","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7070899","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Power generation","Power amplifiers","Zero current switching","Equations","Inductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifiers","zero current switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inverse class-E power amplifier","subnominal condition","any duty ratio","zero-current-switching","zero-current-derivative-switching","parasitic switch-on resistor","output capacitor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Drain efficiency","duty ratio","inverse class-E","power amplifier","sub-nominal","zero-current switching (ZCS)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7070899/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2015","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of Inverse Class-E Power Amplifier at Sub-Nominal Condition for Any Duty Ratio","accessionNumber":"15019692","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7070899/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271036 and 61001032"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of Inverse Class-E Power Amplifier at Sub-Nominal Condition for Any Duty Ratio","sourcePdf":"tcsi-chen-2390557-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07553S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7070848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7070848","articleId":"7070899","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7070930,"authors":[{"name":"Ramesh Oruganti","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University, Blacksburg, 24061, USA"],"firstName":"Ramesh","lastName":"Oruganti"},{"name":"Fred C.

The several types of current-mode controllers differ slightly in their phase-lag characteristics, but they are all far superior to the commonly used PWM duty-ratio controllers. Unfortunately, industry has been slow to appreciate and exploit the considerable advantages of current-mode control. There seem to be two reasons for that: (a) the unavailability of integrated circuits which are well-suited to implementing current-mode controllers and (b) the lack of detailed, systematically organized, theoretical and practical information on current-mode controllers. The objective of this paper is to fill this gap by providing a well-organized compendium of useful information for the design engineer who wants to understand the operation of a current-mode-controlled power converter and to accomplish an optimal design.

Finally, our proposed analytical expressions are numerically compared with the approximate expressions previously given in the literature.","publicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7065145/7065146/07071032.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7065146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closed-form expressions of the true Cramer-Rao bound for parameter estimation of BPSK, MSK or QPSK waveforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071032","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071032/","displayDocTitle":"Closed-form expressions of the true Cramer-Rao bound for parameter estimation of BPSK, MSK or QPSK waveforms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"15056568","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7071032/","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed-form expressions of the true Cramer-Rao bound for parameter estimation of BPSK, MSK or QPSK waveforms","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1568979909.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038246S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7065145","isNumber":"7065146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7065145","xplore-issue":"7065146","articleId":"7071032","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7071034,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The computational complexity is reduced from 11 multiply and 29 add operations (Loeffler DCT) to 38 add and 16 shift operations (which is similar to the complexity of the binDCT). The experimental results show that the proposed DCT algorithm not only reduces the computational complexity significantly, but also retains the good transformation quality of the Loeffler DCT. Therefore, the proposed Cordic based Loeffler DCT can be used in low-power and high-quality CODECs, especially in battery-based systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071034/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"15023736","htmlLink":"/document/7071034/","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A computationally efficient high-quality cordic based DCT","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A computationally efficient high-quality cordic based DCT","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1568979966.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079912S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7065145","isNumber":"7065146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7065145","xplore-issue":"7065146","articleId":"7071034","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7071039,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Wilzeck","affiliation":["Department of Communication Systems, University Duisburg-Essen Faculty of Engineering, Duisburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Wilzeck","id":"37294237200"},{"name":"Patrick Pan","affiliation":["Department of Communication Systems, University Duisburg-Essen Faculty of Engineering, Duisburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Pan","id":"37085608802"},{"name":"Thomas Kaiser","affiliation":["Department of Communication Systems, University Duisburg-Essen Faculty of Engineering, Duisburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Kaiser","id":"37085344169"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2219-5491"}],"articleNumber":"7071039","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Signal to noise ratio","Antennas","Abstracts","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel capacity","channel estimation","equalisers","MIMO communication","optimisation","radio receivers","radio transmitters","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna subset selection","MIMO SC-FDE","frequency selective channels","hardware complexity","multiple-input multiple-output system","MIMO system","channel capacity optimization","frequency flat channel model","spatial-multiplexing","radio transmitter","radio receiver","MIMO single carrier scheme","frequency domain equalization","signal quality","MIMO equalizer output"]}],"abstract":"Antenna (subset) selection is a feasible scheme to reduce the hardware complexity of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems.

The algorithm is based on the Zero-Forcing (ZF) criterion and assumes a number of transmit antennas equals to the number of active users. In contrast to other methods, it ensures a fair treatment of the active users providing them the same signal-to-noise ratio. In multimedia applications, however, several types of information with different quality-of-service (QoS) must be supported. Motivated by the above problem, in the present work we design a ZF THP-based pre-filtering algorithm for multiple antenna multi-user networks in which the base station allocates the transmit power according to the QoS requirement of each active user. In doing so, we consider a system in which the number of active users may be less than the number of transmit antennas. As we will see, in such a case there exists an infinite number of solutions satisfying the ZF criterion.

This is allowed because convolution of a Fourier series with a train of delta functions in the Fourier domain causes overlap in the Fourier domain only in isolated cases. Furthermore, I can restrict this overlap to not occur in more than one sampled transform. I use three different sampling rates, not required to be greater than any particular frequency, yet satisfying certain irrational relationships, which I specify. The three separate Fourier domains from each rate are compared, and a filter is used which outputs only those terms which are common to all three. In some cases, it might be necessary to introduce a fourth sampling rate. The result is that the original Fourier series is obtained from the filter and inverse transform.","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7065145/7065146/07071094.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7065146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"No minimum rate multisampling of a Fourier series","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"No minimum rate multisampling of a Fourier series","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7071094/","accessionNumber":"15024228","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071094/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"No minimum rate multisampling of a Fourier series","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1568980484.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02985S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7065145","isNumber":"7065146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7065145","xplore-issue":"7065146","articleId":"7071094","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7071095,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Schneider","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Ilmenau, Ilmenau, Th\u00c3\u00bcringen, DE"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Schneider"},{"name":"Uwe Trautwein","affiliation":["MEDAV GmbH, Channelsounder Technique, Gr\u00e4fenberger Str. 32-34, D-91080, Uttenreuth, Germany"],"firstName":"Uwe","lastName":"Trautwein"},{"name":"Walter Wirnitzer","affiliation":["MEDAV GmbH, Channelsounder Technique, Gr\u00e4fenberger Str. 32-34, D-91080, Uttenreuth, Germany"],"firstName":"Walter","lastName":"Wirnitzer"},{"name":"Reiner S.

Short simulation times and real-world radio characteristics are the unbeatable advantage of the hardware-in-the-loop approach.","publicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7065145/7065146/07071115.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7065146","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IEEE 802.11N MIMO-prototyping with dirty RF using the hardware-in-the-loop approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071115","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"IEEE 802.11N MIMO-prototyping with dirty RF using the hardware-in-the-loop approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071115/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"15024245","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7071115/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IEEE 802.11N MIMO-prototyping with dirty RF using the hardware-in-the-loop approach","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1568980559.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05327S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7065145","isNumber":"7065146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7065145","xplore-issue":"7065146","articleId":"7071115","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7071150,"authors":[{"name":"Mitsuharu Matsumoto","affiliation":["Department of Applied Physics, Waseda University 55N-4F-10A, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Mitsuharu","lastName":"Matsumoto","id":"37573187600"},{"name":"Shuji Hashimoto","affiliation":["Department of Applied Physics, Waseda University 55N-4F-10A, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shuji","lastName":"Hashimoto","id":"37270326400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2219-5491"}],"articleNumber":"7071150","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":31},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-domain analysis","Microphones","Abstracts","Bismuth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","blind source separation","convolution","frequency-domain analysis","microphones","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anechoic mixtures","time domain","aggregated microphones","blind source separation algorithm","BSS algorithm","amplitude gain difference","directional microphones","sound separation","time-frequency binary masks","convolutive model","anechoic mixing","time-frequency domain","mixing matrix"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind source separation of anechoic mixtures in time domain utilizing aggregated microphones","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7065146","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7065145/7065146/07071150.pdf","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071150","abstract":"This paper introduces a blind source separation (BSS) algorithm in the time domain based on the amplitude gain difference of two directional microphones located at the same place, namely aggregated microphones. A feature of our approach is to treat the BSS problem of the anechoic mixtures in the time domain. Sparseness approach is one of the attractive methods to solve the problem of the sound separation. If the signal is sparse in the frequency domain, the sources rarely overlap. Under this condition, it is possible to extract each signal using time-frequency binary masks. In this paper, we treat the non-stationary, partially disjoint signals. In other words, most of the signals overlap in the time domain and the frequency domain though there exist some intervals where the sound is disjoint. We firstly show the source separation problem can be described not as a convolutive model but as an instantaneous model in spite of the anechoic mixing when the aggregated microphones are assumed. We then show the necessary conditions and show the algorithm with the experimental results. In this method, we can treat the problem not in the time-frequency domain but in the time domain due to the characteristics of the aggregated microphones. In other words, we can consider the problem not in the complex space but in the real space. The mixing matrix can be directly identified utilizing the observed signals without estimating the intervals where the signal is disjoint through all the processes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071150/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","accessionNumber":"15024327","htmlLink":"/document/7071150/","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Blind source separation of anechoic mixtures in time domain utilizing aggregated microphones","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind source separation of anechoic mixtures in time domain utilizing aggregated microphones","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1568980712.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098117S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7065145","isNumber":"7065146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7065145","xplore-issue":"7065146","articleId":"7071150","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7071153,"authors":[{"name":"Luciano Sarperi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, The University of Liverpool, Liverpool, U.K"],"firstName":"Luciano","lastName":"Sarperi","id":"37403636200"},{"name":"Xu Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, The University of Liverpool, Liverpool, U.K"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37278845900"},{"name":"Asoke K.

Existing blind frequency-recovery algorithms for OFDM are able to provide a reliable estimate of the frequency offset up to an integer multiple of the subcarrier spacing. To resolve the remaining ambiguity, one can employ either pilot symbols or the unknown coded data symbols. Clearly, the latter method results in a higher bandwidth efficiency. Similar considerations hold for the estimation of a frequency-selective MIMO channel. In this contribution, we propose a code-aided technique to jointly estimate the channel and resolve the frequency ambiguity. The estimator is based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and exploits information from the unknown coded data symbols and only a small number of pilot symbols. A significant performance gain is observed compared to existing, solely pilot-based estimation techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code-aided frequency ambiguity resolution and channel estimation for MIMO OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7065145/7065146/07071155.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7065146","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071155","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071155/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Code-aided frequency ambiguity resolution and channel estimation for MIMO OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7071155/","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"15024123","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code-aided frequency ambiguity resolution and channel estimation for MIMO OFDM systems","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1568980736.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052354S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7065145","isNumber":"7065146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7065145","xplore-issue":"7065146","articleId":"7071155","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7071166,"authors":[{"name":"Saeed Mian Qaisar","affiliation":["TIMA, CNRS UMR 5159, Grenoble Cedex"],"firstName":"Saeed","lastName":"Mian Qaisar","id":"37088032064"},{"name":"Laurent Fesquet","affiliation":["TIMA, CNRS UMR 5159, Grenoble Cedex"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Fesquet","id":"37295549700"},{"name":"Marc Renaudin","affiliation":["TIMA, CNRS UMR 5159, Grenoble Cedex"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Renaudin","id":"37282559600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2219-5491"}],"articleNumber":"7071166","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":51},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Equations","Mathematical model","Algorithm design and analysis","Signal processing algorithms","Spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","discrete Fourier transforms","signal sampling","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectral analysis","signal driven sampling scheme","classical signal processing chain","mobile systems","time sampled points","nonuniformly sampled signal analysis","spectral analysis technique","computational complexity","general discrete Fourier transform","Lomb algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071166","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7065146","publicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7065145/7065146/07071166.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral analysis of a signal driven sampling scheme","abstract":"This work is a part of a drastic revolution in the classical signal processing chain required in mobile systems.

It is shown that the EIRP-scaled MR beamformer demonstrates significant performance degradation compared to the TP case. A joint optimization problem for the beamforming weights over all the sub-carriers subject to the EIRP constraint is formulated based on maximization of the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver.

Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the excellent accuracy of the derived approximation in all cases.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closed-form approximation for the outage capacity of OFDM-STBC and OFDM-SFBC systems","publicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7065145/7065146/07071194.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7065146","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071194","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071194/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Closed-form approximation for the outage capacity of OFDM-STBC and OFDM-SFBC systems","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7071194/","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"15024196","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed-form approximation for the outage capacity of OFDM-STBC and OFDM-SFBC systems","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1568981159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050799S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7065145","isNumber":"7065146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7065145","xplore-issue":"7065146","articleId":"7071194","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7071199,"authors":[{"name":"Maoge Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Nanjing University of Science & Technology, Nanjing, R.P., China"],"lastName":"Maoge Xu","id":"37088141829"},{"name":"Yaoliang Song","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Nanjing University of Science & Technology, Nanjing, R.P., China"],"lastName":"Yaoliang Song","id":"37087440640"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2219-5491"}],"articleNumber":"7071199","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Abstracts","Standards","Kalman filters","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive processes","demodulation","particle filtering (numerical methods)","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulation","M-QAM signals","particle filtering","uncoded M-PSK signals","Rayleigh flat fading channels","Jakes' model","channel state","first order autoregressive process","decision-directed Kalman filter","M-ary phase ambiguity","uncoded QAM signals"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071199","abstract":"In this paper, the problem of particle filter to demodulate uncoded M-PSK and M-QAM signals over Rayleigh flat fading channels is investigated.

To substantiate this claim, a simple quite natural modification is put forward and assessed in this paper. It merely consists of performing exact line search optimization of the contrast function.

Assuming quasi-synchronous users, LPTVMA systems can be considered as Multi User Interference (MUI) free systems. Hence LPTVMA systems can be equalized. In multipath channels the equalization step uses a Zero Padding (ZP) technique. The equivalent channel to equalize is a zero-pad channel. For such zero-pad channels the MLSE can be efficiently implemented by using a parallel trellis Viterbi algorithm. The complexity of the MLSE can be further reduced because the padding zeros have known positions in the received signal. The proposed MLSE uses a periodic time-varying trellis. Thus the number of states of the MLSE can be reduced.

WL filters linearly and independently process both the real and the imaginary parts of the input signals, and they are usually employed in order to trade-off a limited increase in the computational complexity with performance gains when the input signals are circularly variant. For this reason, we propose to resort to WL processing in the synthesis of the MIMO transceiver when real-valued data streams have to be transmitted. The performance analysis shows significant performance advantages of the proposed WL-MMSE MIMO transceiver with respect to the linear one.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7065145/7065146/07071290.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7065146","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Widely linear MMSE transceiver for real-valued sequences over MIMO channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","MIMO","Abstracts","Joints","Information filters","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","decoding","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","precoding","radio transceivers","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["widely linear MMSE transceiver","real-valued sequences","MIMO channel","multiple-input multiple-output channel","minimum-mean-square-error criterion","MMSE criterion","computational complexity","WL processing","MIMO transceiver","real-valued data streams"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071290/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Widely linear MMSE transceiver for real-valued sequences over MIMO channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7071290/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"15033477","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Widely linear MMSE transceiver for real-valued sequences over MIMO channel","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1568981691.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098858S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7065145","isNumber":"7065146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7065145","xplore-issue":"7065146","articleId":"7071290","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7071294,"authors":[{"name":"Ivana Raos","affiliation":["ETSI Telecomunicaci\u00f3n, Ciudad Universitaria s/n, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Ivana","lastName":"Raos","id":"37283568900"},{"name":"Santiago Zazo","affiliation":["ETSI Telecomunicaci\u00f3n, Ciudad Universitaria s/n, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Santiago","lastName":"Zazo","id":"37283526500"},{"name":"Igor Arambasic","affiliation":["ETSI Telecomunicaci\u00f3n, Ciudad Universitaria s/n, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Igor","lastName":"Arambasic","id":"37704237500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2219-5491"}],"articleNumber":"7071294","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Europe","Signal to noise ratio","Bandwidth","Robustness","Interference","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","pulse shaping","quadrature amplitude modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM","spectrally efficient multicarrier system","mobile channel variability","pulse shaping","discrete nonorthogonal pulse","discrete prolate spheroidal sequence","time shifts","frequency shifts","DPSS pulse analysis","MC symbol length","MC-OQAM system performance","DPSS quasi-orthogonality","adjacent frequency bands","frequency separation","Slepian pulses","multicarrier OQAM"]}],"abstract":"OFDM/OQAM is spectrally efficient multicarrier (MC) system, robust to mobile channel (time and frequency) variability thanks to pulse shaping. In this contribution, pulse shaping with discrete non-orthogonal pulse based on Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequence (DPSS), is proposed. DPSS, being the most concentrated pulse out of all sequences of the same length, is the natural choice for pulse shaping. The novelty of the analysis lies in the discovery of quasi-orthogonality property of DPSS to its time and frequency shifts. DPSS pulse analysis shows that this property is valid in the case of short pulse of the single MC symbol length. MC/OQAM system performance with DPSS and other pulses types is analyzed by simulation confirming the quasi-orthogonality of DPSS. The advantage of using the most concentrated pulse is shown in terms of interference that two MC/OQAM systems in adjacent frequency bands cause one to another. Simulations also show that DPSS permits smaller frequency separation between systems that are allocated adjacent frequency bands.","publicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7065145/7065146/07071294.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7065146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Slepian pulses for multicarrier OQAM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071294","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071294/","displayDocTitle":"Slepian pulses for multicarrier OQAM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"15023937","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7071294/","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Slepian pulses for multicarrier OQAM","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1568981702.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113305S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7065145","isNumber":"7065146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7065145","xplore-issue":"7065146","articleId":"7071294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7071296,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Jakobsson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Karlstad University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Jakobsson","id":"37085361536"},{"name":"Stephen R.

The first algorithm, abbreviated as EFICA, is a sophisticated variant of the well-known Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm FastICA. EFICA is based on minimizing the statistical dependencies between the instantaneous (marginal) distributions of the estimated source signals and therefore disregards any possible time structure of the sources. The second algorithm, WASOBI, is a weight-adjusted variant of SOBI, a popular BSS algorithm that uses only the time structure of the source signals to achieve the separation. The separation accuracy of EFICA and WASOBI can be assessed using the estimated source signals alone, therefore allowing us to choose the most appropriate of the two in every scenario. Here, two different EFICA- WASOBI combination approaches are proposed and their performance assessed using images and simulated signals.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind signal separation by combining two ICA algorithms: HOS-based EFICA and time structure-based WASOBI","publicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7065145/7065146/07071301.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7065146","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071301","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Blind signal separation by combining two ICA algorithms: HOS-based EFICA and time structure-based WASOBI","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7071301/","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"15024120","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind signal separation by combining two ICA algorithms: HOS-based EFICA and time structure-based WASOBI","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1568981712.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060188S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7065145","isNumber":"7065146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7065145","xplore-issue":"7065146","articleId":"7071301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7071304,"authors":[{"name":"Giacinto Gelli","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica e delle Telecomunicazioni, Universita degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Giacinto","lastName":"Gelli","id":"37282077600"},{"name":"Francesco Verde","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica e delle Telecomunicazioni, Universita degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Verde","id":"37284554800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2219-5491"}],"articleNumber":"7071304","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":11},"abstract":"The problem of blind channel identification in quasi-synchronous (QS) multicarrier code-division multiple-access (MC-CDMA) systems is considered.

Simulation results indicate that the proposed method provides coding gain of up to 3.0 dB in PSNR compared to the conventional motion-compensated prediction method using motion vectors with 1/2-pel accuracy.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7065145/7065146/07071350.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7065146","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071350","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block matching-based motion compensation with arbitrary accuracy using adaptive interpolation filters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Containers","Abstracts","Interpolation","Encoding","Diamonds","Table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","image filtering","interpolation","motion compensation","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block matching based motion compensation","adaptive interpolation filter","motion compensated prediction method","nonseparable 2D interpolation filter","side information reduction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071350/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Block matching-based motion compensation with arbitrary accuracy using adaptive interpolation filters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7071350/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"15024312","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block matching-based motion compensation with arbitrary accuracy using adaptive interpolation filters","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1568981799.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075056S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7065145","isNumber":"7065146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7065145","xplore-issue":"7065146","articleId":"7071350","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7071387,"authors":[{"name":"Ravi Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Computer Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, Uttaranchal, India"],"firstName":"Ravi","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37416837700"},{"name":"Divya Sarthi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Computer Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, Uttaranchal, India"],"firstName":"Divya","lastName":"Sarthi","id":"38131215200"},{"name":"Ankush Mittal","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Computer Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, Uttaranchal, India"],"firstName":"Ankush","lastName":"Mittal","id":"37270139200"},{"name":"Kuldip Singh","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Computer Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, Uttaranchal, India"],"firstName":"Kuldip","lastName":"Singh","id":"37289890600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2219-5491"}],"articleNumber":"7071387","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":28},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Abstracts","Genomics","Bioinformatics","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological techniques","cancer","DNA","genetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exactly periodic subspace decomposition technique","DNA sequence","tandem repeat analysis","tandem repetitive structure","telomere","trinucleotide tandem repeat","degenerative disease","DNA fingerprinting","inexact tandem repeat identification","sliding window approach","tandem repeat location","individual nucleotide repetition"]}],"abstract":"The identification and analysis of tandem repeats is an active area of biological and computational research. Tandem repetitive structures in telomeres plays a role in cancer and hyper-variable, trinucleotide tandem repeats are linked to over a dozen major degenerative diseases. They also play a very crucial role in DNA fingerprinting. In this paper we present an algorithm to identify the exact and inexact tandem repeats in DNA sequences based on orthogonal exactly periodic subspace decomposition technique. The algorithm uses a sliding window approach to identify the location of tandem repeats and other patterns that are present in DNA sequence due to repetition of individual nucleotides. Our algorithm also resolves the problems that were present in periodicity explorer algorithm for identifying tandem repeats. The time complexity of the algorithm, when searching for repeats for window size `W' in a DNA sequence S of length N is O(NWlgW). We present some experimental results concerning to sensitivity of our algorithm.","publicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7065145/7065146/07071387.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7065146","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exactly periodic subspace decomposition based approach for identifying tandem repeats in DNA sequences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071387","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Exactly periodic subspace decomposition based approach for identifying tandem repeats in DNA sequences","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071387/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"15023709","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7071387/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exactly periodic subspace decomposition based approach for identifying tandem repeats in DNA sequences","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1568981857.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062789S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7065145","isNumber":"7065146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7065145","xplore-issue":"7065146","articleId":"7071387","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7071392,"authors":[{"name":"Akihide Horita","affiliation":["Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Kanazawa Univ., Kanazawa, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Akihide","lastName":"Horita","id":"37324945300"},{"name":"Kenji Nakayama","affiliation":["Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Kanazawa Univ., Kanazawa, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Kenji","lastName":"Nakayama","id":"37269962600"},{"name":"Akihiro Hirano","affiliation":["Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Kanazawa Univ., Kanazawa, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Akihiro","lastName":"Hirano","id":"37274998000"},{"name":"Yasuhiro Dejima","affiliation":["Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Kanazawa Univ., Kanazawa, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Yasuhiro","lastName":"Dejima","id":"37282123300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2219-5491"}],"articleNumber":"7071392","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":16},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distortion","Source separation","Abstracts","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic distortion","acoustic signal processing","blind source separation","feedback","feedforward","frequency-domain analysis","learning (artificial intelligence)","speech processing","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning algorithm","distortion free constraint","blind source separation","feedforward BSS system","FF-BSS systems","feedback BSS system","FB-BSS system","signal distortion","time domains","frequency domains","speech signals","transmission time difference","mixing process","signal sources","sensors"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7065146","publicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7065145/7065146/07071392.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A learning algorithm with distortion free constraint and comparative study for feedforward and feedback BSS","abstract":"Source separation and signal distortion are theoretically analyzed for the FF-BSS systems implemented in both the time and frequency domains and the FB-BSS system.

We compare the rates expected from theory on the measured indoor channels with rates achieved in the experiments.","publicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7065145/7065146/07071422.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7065146","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time experiments on channel adaptive transmission in the multi-user up-link at very high data rates using MIMO-OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071422","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-time experiments on channel adaptive transmission in the multi-user up-link at very high data rates using MIMO-OFDM","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071422/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"15023993","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7071422/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time experiments on channel adaptive transmission in the multi-user up-link at very high data rates using MIMO-OFDM","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1568981911.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060553S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7065145","isNumber":"7065146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7065145","xplore-issue":"7065146","articleId":"7071422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7071429,"authors":[{"name":"Mikael Coldrey","affiliation":["Chalmers tekniska hogskola, Goteborg, SE"],"firstName":"Mikael","lastName":"Coldrey"},{"name":"Mats Viberg","affiliation":["Department of Signals & Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mats","lastName":"Viberg","id":"37268515700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2219-5491"}],"articleNumber":"7071429","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Abstracts","Optimized production technology","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","covariance matrices","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","matched filters","sensor arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatially distributed sources localization","source-based conventional beamformer","multiple distributed sources","sensor array processing","distributed source","generalized CBF","eigenvector","parameterized signal covariance matrix","matched filter","generalized 2-dimensional beamforming spectrum","generalized Capon estimator","asymptotic performance analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071429","publicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","abstract":"In this paper, we generalize the point source-based conventional beamformer (CBF) to localization of multiple distributed sources that appear in sensor array processing.

IQ-imbalance and CFO arise due to imperfections in the receiver and/or transmitter analog front-end, whereas user mobility and CFO give rise to channel time-variation. In addition to IQ-imbalance and the channel time-variation, the cyclic prefix (CP) length may be shorter than the channel impulse response length, which in turn gives rise to inter-block interference (IBI). While IQ-imbalance results in a mirroring effect, the channel time-variation results in inter-carrier interference (ICI). The frequency-domain equalizer is proposed to compensate for the IQ-imbalance taking into account ICI and IBI. The frequency-domain equalizer is obtained by transferring a time-domain equalizer to the frequency-domain resulting in the so-called per-tone equalizer (PTEQ).","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7065145/7065146/07071448.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7065146","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071448","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-domain IQ-imbalance and carrier frequency offset compensation for OFDM over doubly selective channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Floors","Frequency-domain analysis","Abstracts","Frequency estimation","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","frequency-domain analysis","intercarrier interference","mobile radio","OFDM modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain IQ-imbalance","carrier frequency offset compensation","doubly selective channels","OFDM transmission","channel time-variation","impulse response length","inter-block interference","time-domain equalizer","per-tone equalizer","PTEQ","ICI","inter-carrier interference","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","cyclic prefix"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071448/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-domain IQ-imbalance and carrier frequency offset compensation for OFDM over doubly selective channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7071448/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"15033485","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-domain IQ-imbalance and carrier frequency offset compensation for OFDM over doubly selective channels","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1568981947.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060068S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7065145","isNumber":"7065146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7065145","xplore-issue":"7065146","articleId":"7071448","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7071455,"authors":[{"name":"Johan Karedal","affiliation":["Dept. of Electroscience, Lund University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Johan","lastName":"Karedal","id":"37294190900"},{"name":"Anders J Johansson","affiliation":["Dept. of Electroscience, Lund University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Anders J","lastName":"Johansson","id":"37285502300"},{"name":"Fredrik Tufvesson","affiliation":["Dept. of Electroscience, Lund University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Fredrik","lastName":"Tufvesson","id":"37296876300"},{"name":"Andreas F.

In this paper, we present results from a measurement campaign for PAN channels between two handheld devices. The measurements are conducted over distances of 1-10 m using two handheld four-element antenna devices. For each distance, a number of channel realizations are obtained by moving the devices over a small area, and by rotating the persons holding the devices. We find that the correlation between the antenna elements is low. The small-scale statistics of the amplitude are well described by the Rayleigh distribution in many cases, but the effects of shadowing by the body of the operator can lead to different statistics.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7065145/7065146/07071455.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7065146","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of MIMO channels for handheld devices in personal area networks at 5 GHz","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Green products","Wireless communication","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","mobile handsets","personal area networks","radiotelemetry","radiowave propagation","Rayleigh channels","statistics","wide area networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO channel propagation","personal area network","PAN","wide-area network","mobility model","handheld four-element antenna device","small-scale statistics","Rayleigh distribution","frequency 5 GHz","distance 1 m to 10 m"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071455/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of MIMO channels for handheld devices in personal area networks at 5 GHz","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7071455/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"15024293","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of MIMO channels for handheld devices in personal area networks at 5 GHz","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1568981956.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042585S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7065145","isNumber":"7065146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7065145","xplore-issue":"7065146","articleId":"7071455","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7071464,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Starting from a vector of 462 features, a subset of features is obtained providing a good discrimination between neutral, angry, loud and Lombard states for the SUSAS simulated domain and between neutral and stressed states for the SUSAS actual domain.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071480/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15056595","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7071480/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Classification of speech under stress using features selected by genetic algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of speech under stress using features selected by genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1568981990.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058015S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7065145","isNumber":"7065146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7065145","xplore-issue":"7065146","articleId":"7071480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7071488,"authors":[{"name":"A\u00efssa Ikhlef","affiliation":["IETR/Supelec, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"A\u00efssa","lastName":"Ikhlef","id":"37543201400"},{"name":"Daniel Le Guennec","affiliation":["IETR/Supelec, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Le Guennec","id":"37449718800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2219-5491"}],"articleNumber":"7071488","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"abstract":"In this paper, The problem of blind recovery of QAM signals for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communication systems is investigated. We propose a new criterion based on the real (or equivalently the imaginary) part of the equalizer outputs, with a cross correlation constraint. A performance analysis reveals the absence of any undesirable local stationary points, which ensures perfect recovery of all transmitted signals and global convergence of the algorithm. From the proposed criterion an adaptive algorithm is derived. It is shown that the proposed algorithm presents a lower computational complexity compared to the constant modulus algorithm (CMA) and multimodulus algorithm (MMA). The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by some numerical results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7065145/7065146/07071488.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7065146","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071488","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind recovery of MIMO QAM signals: A criterion with its convergence analysys","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Abstracts","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","equalisers","MIMO communication","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind recovery","MIMO QAM signals","convergence analysys","multiple-input multiple-output communication systems","equalizer","cross correlation constraint","performance analysis","local stationary points","global convergence","adaptive algorithm","computational complexity","constant modulus algorithm","multimodulus algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071488/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Blind recovery of MIMO QAM signals: A criterion with its convergence analysys","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7071488/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"15024179","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind recovery of MIMO QAM signals: A criterion with its convergence analysys","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1568981998.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051828S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7065145","isNumber":"7065146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7065145","xplore-issue":"7065146","articleId":"7071488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7071491,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Soft cancellation and minimum mean squared error filtering (SC/MMSE) turbo equalization and its complexity reduced version, turbo equalized diversity, is considered. Furthermore, another version of equalized diversity, turbo equalized diversity with common SC/MMSE, which exploits the transmit diversity and coding gain through the cross-wise iterations over the decoding branches, is evaluated. The multi-dimensional channel sounding measurement data used for the simulations consists of snapshots measured in different channel conditions in terms of spatial and temporal properties. The system-level assessment is in terms of outage probabilities of the performance figures such as bit and frame error rates obtained by evaluating their cumulative probability densities as well as throughput efficiencies using the field measurement data. It is found that the receivers considered in this paper can all provide reasonable system-level performance. However, turbo equalized diversity receiver is more sensitive to the channel conditions than the original SC/MMSE equalizer.

However, once delays of secondary multipath rays are greater than the guard interval duration, intersymbol interference causes a severe degradation in the transmission performance. To solve this problem, a multiple antenna array can be used at the receiver, not only for spectral efficiency or gain enhancement, but also for interference suppression. In this paper we analyze the asymptotical behavior of two beamforming algorithms, a low complexity pre-FFT method and a more efficient post-FFT system. The optimum weight set for beamformers is derived on the basis of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion and the Wiener solution is studied under different working conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7065145/7065146/07071496.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7065146","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wiener solution for OFDM pre and post-FFT beamforming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel models","Vectors","Radio frequency","Erbium","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","fading channels","fast Fourier transforms","intersymbol interference","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Wiener solution","OFDM","FFT beamforming","fast Fourier transform","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multipath fading channel","intersymbol interference","multiple antenna array","interference suppression","beamforming algorithms","minimum mean square error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071496/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Wiener solution for OFDM pre and post-FFT beamforming","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7071496/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"15023981","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wiener solution for OFDM pre and post-FFT beamforming","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1568982009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.134679S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7065145","isNumber":"7065146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7065145","xplore-issue":"7065146","articleId":"7071496","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7071507,"authors":[{"name":"Radoslaw Mazur","affiliation":["Department of Physics, University of Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Radoslaw","lastName":"Mazur","id":"37626767400"},{"name":"Alfred Mertins","affiliation":["Department of Physics, University of Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Alfred","lastName":"Mertins","id":"37085394127"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2219-5491"}],"articleNumber":"7071507","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":21},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reverberation","Blind source separation","Abstracts","Sensors","Presses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["all-pass filters","blind source separation","convolution","frequency response","reverberation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reverberation effects","convolutive blind source separation","reduced intelligibility","separated sources","speech signals","demixing filters","frequency responses","near allpass character"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new method for reducing the reverberation effects in convolutive blind source separation which lead to reduced intelligibility of the separated sources (e.g., speech signals).

This means that the channel estimate lies in a rank-2 subspace, which can be easily determined applying a first principal component analysis (PCA) step. To eliminate the remaining ambiguity, we propose to apply a constant modulus algorithm (CMA). This combined PCA+CMA approach provides an effective solution for the blind identification of those OSTBCs that can not be identified using only SOS. Some simulation results are presented to show the performance of the proposed method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind identification of MIMO-OSTBC channels combining second and higher order statistics","publicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7065145/7065146/07071522.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7065146","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071522","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071522/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Blind identification of MIMO-OSTBC channels combining second and higher order statistics","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7071522/","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"15024330","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind identification of MIMO-OSTBC channels combining second and higher order statistics","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1568982049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051016S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7065145","isNumber":"7065146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7065145","xplore-issue":"7065146","articleId":"7071522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7071531,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Schubert","affiliation":["Fraunhofer German-Sino Lab for Mobile Communications, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Schubert","id":"37265056000"},{"name":"Shuying Shi","affiliation":["Fraunhofer German-Sino Lab for Mobile Communications, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Shuying","lastName":"Shi","id":"37291460500"},{"name":"Holger Boche","affiliation":["Fraunhofer German-Sino Lab for Mobile Communications, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Holger","lastName":"Boche","id":"37276597900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2219-5491"}],"articleNumber":"7071531","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":41},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uplink","Downlink","Resource management","Optimization","Receivers","MIMO","Transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filters","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","optimisation","space division multiplexing","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonconvex problem formulation","power allocation strategy","spatial multiplexing","minimum-mean-square-error","linear receive filters","linear transmit filters","per-user MMSE requirements","linear multiuser MIMO channels","iterative transceiver optimization"]}],"abstract":"We address the problem of jointly optimizing linear transmit and receive filters for a multi-user MIMO system, under the assumption that all users have individual Minimum-Mean-Square-Error (MMSE) requirements.

All users and layers are coupled by interference, so the choice of filters is intricately interwoven with the power allocation strategy. The design goal is to minimize the total power subject to MMSE constraints. This results in a non-convex problem formulation, for which we propose an iterative algorithm.

Motivated by recent work in robust adaptive beamforming, we develop variants of the constrained robust adaptive beamformer that attempt to limit the search in the underlying optimization problem to a feasible set of steering vectors thereby achieving improved performance. The robustness against steering vector error is provided through a spherical uncertainty set constraint, while a set of magnitude constraints is enforced on each element of the steering vector to better constrain the search in the space of feasible steering vectors. By appropriately changing the variables, the optimization problem is modified such that the need for the magnitude constraints are avoided. The developed algorithm is tested in the context of speech enhancement using a microphone array and shown to be superior to existing algorithms.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7065146","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7065145/7065146/07071543.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust adaptive beamformer with feasibility constraint on the steering vector","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071543/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/7071543/","displayDocTitle":"Robust adaptive beamformer with feasibility constraint on the steering vector","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"15023845","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust adaptive beamformer with feasibility constraint on the steering vector","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1568982087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059022S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7065145","isNumber":"7065146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7065145","xplore-issue":"7065146","articleId":"7071543","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7071549,"authors":[{"name":"Q.

The logic synthesis on 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS technology shows that our design outperforms in complexity similar state-of-the-art solutions and makes the check node operations no longer critical to the complexity of the whole decoder.","publicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7065145/7065146/07071601.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7065146","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-precision LDPC codes decoding at the lowest complexity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071601/","displayDocTitle":"High-precision LDPC codes decoding at the lowest complexity","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7071601/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"15024276","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-precision LDPC codes decoding at the lowest complexity","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1568982197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062155S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7065145","isNumber":"7065146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7065145","xplore-issue":"7065146","articleId":"7071601","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7071612,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS) algorithm is a flexible and distortionless peak power reduction scheme of low computational complexity. In this paper we experimentally derive a new set of weighting factors which improve the performance of the PTS algorithm while the computational complexity remains the same. Furthermore, this paper examines the complexity of the VLSI implementation of PTS versus the power savings in the analog part due to the PAPR reduction. It is here shown that with the new set of weighting factors the power consumption of PA is reduced by 21.1% in comparison to OFDM without PAPR reduction.","publicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7065145/7065146/07071616.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7065146","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel efficient weighting factors for PTS-based PAPR reduction in low-power OFDM transmitters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071616","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Novel efficient weighting factors for PTS-based PAPR reduction in low-power OFDM transmitters","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071616/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"15024029","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7071616/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel efficient weighting factors for PTS-based PAPR reduction in low-power OFDM transmitters","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1568982220.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043982S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7065145","isNumber":"7065146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7065145","xplore-issue":"7065146","articleId":"7071616","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7071618,"authors":[{"name":"Vijaya krishna.

It depends on the direction of the channel gain vector of the user of interest if the channel gains are correlated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear detectors for multi-user MIMO systems with correlated spatial diversity","publicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7065145/7065146/07071643.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7065146","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071643","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071643/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Linear detectors for multi-user MIMO systems with correlated spatial diversity","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7071643/","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"15024340","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear detectors for multi-user MIMO systems with correlated spatial diversity","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1568982263.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065648S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7065145","isNumber":"7065146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7065145","xplore-issue":"7065146","articleId":"7071643","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7071648,"authors":[{"name":"Gerhard Wunder","affiliation":["Fraunhofer German-Sino Mobile Communications Lab, Heinrich-Hertz-Institut, Berlin"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Wunder","id":"37283909500"},{"name":"Thomas Michel","affiliation":["Fraunhofer German-Sino Mobile Communications Lab, Heinrich-Hertz-Institut, Berlin"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Michel","id":"37288322200"},{"name":"Chan Zhou","affiliation":["Fraunhofer German-Sino Mobile Communications Lab, Heinrich-Hertz-Institut, Berlin"],"firstName":"Chan","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37419685000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2219-5491"}],"articleNumber":"7071648","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":12},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Throughput","Vectors","Fading","Resource management","Stability analysis","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast communication","OFDM modulation","radiocommunication","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","OFDM broadcast systems","OFDM broadcast channel","scheduling policy","maximum weight matching","minimum rates","minimum sum power","maximum throughput"]}],"abstract":"We consider an OFDM broadcast channel (BC) where resources have to be allocated among M users according to a scheduling policy.

However, in the presence of frequency nulls in the channel response, the uncoded OFDM faces serious symbol recovery problems. As an alternative to previously reported error correction techniques in the form of pre-coding for OFDM, we propose the use of post-coding of OFDM symbols in order to achieve frequency diversity. Our proposed novel post-coded OFDM (PC-OFDM) comprises of two steps: 1) upsampling of OFDM symbols and 2) subsequent multiplication of each symbol with unit magnitude complex exponentials. It is important to mention that PC-OFDM introduces redundancy in OFDM symbols while precoded OFDM introduces redundancy in data symbols before performing the IFFT operation. The main advantages of this scheme are reduction in system complexity by having a simple encoder/decoder, smaller size IFFT/FFT (inverse fast Fourier transform/fast Fourier transform) modules, and lower clock rates in the receiver and transmitter leading to lower energy consumption. The proposed system is found to be equally good over Gaussian and fading channels where it achieves the maximum diversity gain of the channel. Simulation results show that PC-OFDM performs better than existing precoded OFDM and Pulse OFDM systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity post-coded OFDM communication system: Design and performance analysis","publicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7065145/7065146/07071699.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7065146","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071699","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071699/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity post-coded OFDM communication system: Design and performance analysis","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7071699/","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"15024352","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity post-coded OFDM communication system: Design and performance analysis","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1568982348.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068289S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7065145","isNumber":"7065146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7065145","xplore-issue":"7065146","articleId":"7071699","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7071701,"authors":[{"name":"Manuel A.

The main feaures of SMC techniques that make them appealing for the equalization problem are (a) their potential to provide asymptotically optimal performance in terms of bit error rate and (b) their suitability for implementation using parallel hardware. Nevertheless, existing SMC equalizers still exhibit a very high computational complexity, relative to the dimensions of the MIMO channel, which makes them useless in practical situations. In this paper we introduce two new SMC equalizers whose computational load is only of polynomial order with respect to the channel dimensions, and avoid computationally heavy tasks such as matrix inversions. The performance of the proposed techniques is numerically illustrated by means of computer simulations.","publicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7065145/7065146/07071701.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7065146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SMC algorithms for approximate-map equalization of MIMO channels with polynomial complexity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071701","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071701/","displayDocTitle":"SMC algorithms for approximate-map equalization of MIMO channels with polynomial complexity","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"15024044","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7071701/","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SMC algorithms for approximate-map equalization of MIMO channels with polynomial complexity","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1568982361.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056761S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7065145","isNumber":"7065146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7065145","xplore-issue":"7065146","articleId":"7071701","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7071703,"authors":[{"name":"Wolfgang Utschick","affiliation":["Associate Institute for Signal Processing, Munich University of Technology (TUM) Theresienstr. 90, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Utschick","id":"37273316200"},{"name":"Michael Joham","affiliation":["Associate Institute for Signal Processing, Munich University of Technology (TUM) Theresienstr. 90, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Joham","id":"37285062400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2219-5491"}],"articleNumber":"7071703","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","MIMO","Abstracts","Periodic structures","Wiener filters","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","duality (mathematics)","equalisers","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","precoding","transforms","Wiener filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO transmission technique","multiuser communication","algebraic structure","dual uplink problem","uplink-downlink duality","mean square error","precoder","equalizer","uplink-downlink transformation","user-wise MSE duality","stream-wise MSE duality","transmit Wiener filter","TxWF"]}],"abstract":"Since the downlink has a difficult algebraic structure, it is more convenient to switch to the dual uplink problem which has better algebraic properties. We consider the uplink/downlink duality with respect to the mean square error (MSE), where our system model is as general as possible, i.e., we allow not only for correlations of the symbols and noise, but also model the precoders, the channels, and the equalizers as compact linear operators. We show that a duality with respect to the MSE per user is preferable to the state-of-the-art stream-wise MSE duality, since the uplink/downlink transformation of the user-wise MSE duality has a considerably lower complexity than the one of the stream-wise MSE duality. Interestingly, the uplink/downlink transformation for the total MSE duality is trivial, i.e., a simple weighting with a scalar common for all filters has to be computed. We apply the uplink/downlink duality to derive the operator form of the well-known transmit Wiener filter (TxWF).","publicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7065145/7065146/07071703.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7065146","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the duality of MIMO transmission techniques for multi-user communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071703","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the duality of MIMO transmission techniques for multi-user communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071703/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"15024151","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7071703/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the duality of MIMO transmission techniques for multi-user communications","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1568982363.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048308S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7065145","isNumber":"7065146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7065145","xplore-issue":"7065146","articleId":"7071703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7071712,"authors":[{"name":"Timo Roman","affiliation":["SMARAD CoE, Helsinki University of Technology, HUT, Finland"],"firstName":"Timo","lastName":"Roman","id":"37272352400"},{"name":"Andreas Richter","affiliation":["SMARAD CoE, Helsinki University of Technology, HUT, Finland"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Richter","id":"37279120500"},{"name":"Visa Koivunen","affiliation":["SMARAD CoE, Helsinki University of Technology, HUT, Finland"],"firstName":"Visa","lastName":"Koivunen","id":"37269798700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2219-5491"}],"articleNumber":"7071712","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Modulation","Signal to noise ratio","Abstracts","Measurement","Interference","Couplings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","fading channels","frequency estimation","maximum likelihood estimation","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","synchronisation","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound","blind carrier frequency offset estimation","blind CFO estimation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","constant modulus constellations","blind maximum likelihood CFO estimator","frequency synchronization","time selective channels","frequency selective channels","maximum likelihood estimates","channel parameters"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we derive the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound for blind carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with constant modulus constellations.

The approach is thus very attractive for time and frequency (i.e., doubly) selective channels where the CFO may be time varying.

To mitigate the severe time dispersiveness of the channel single carrier with cyclic prefix (SCCP) is employed and the equalization is performed in the frequency domain. The use of cyclic prefix (CP) and equalization in the frequency domain simplifies the challenging problem of equalization in MIMO channels due to both the inter-symbol-interference (ISI) and co-antenna interference (CAI). The proposed iterative algorithm works in two stages. The first stage estimates the transmitted frequency domain symbols using a low complexity MMSE equalizer. The second stage finds the a posteriori probabilities of the estimated symbols to find their means and variances to use in the MMSE equalizer in the following iteration.

The memristor manufacturing is facing various challenges due to the difficulty to control its process variation, as it is fabricated at nano-scale geometry's size. Process variation result in deviating the actual electrical behavior of memristors from the desired values. This deviation results in reducing the yield especially in the memristor-based memory design. Therefore, it is very important to understand and characterize the impact of process variation on memristor performance and yield and attempt to maximize the yield of the memristor-based memory arrays.","doi":"10.1109/ICM.2014.7071792","publicationTitle":"2014 26th International Conference on Microelectronics (ICM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 26th International Conference on Microelectronics (ICM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7066216/7071786/07071792.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICM.2014.7071792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7071786","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Yield maximization of TiO<sub>2&gt;/sub&gt; memristor-based memory arrays</sub>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Dec. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071792/","displayDocTitle":"Yield maximization of TiO<sub>2&gt;/sub&gt; memristor-based memory arrays</sub>","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7071792/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"14-17 Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15026429","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Yield maximization of TiO<sub>2&gt;/sub&gt; memristor-based memory arrays</sub>","confLoc":"Doha, Qatar","sourcePdf":"006icmsubmission7.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057737S","chronDate":"14-17 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7066216","isNumber":"7071786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7066216","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7071786","articleId":"7071792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":7071793,"authors":[{"name":"Raymond Lee","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Comp.

However, the asymmetry between the ON and OFF switching times of the device hinders the adaption of the device in modern electronics systems. The contribution of this paper is to explore the relationship between the length of the memristor and the switching times. To achieve this the nonlinear model of oxygen vacancies is used. The model also includes coupling with electron transfer. The study shows that tuning the device length can affect the switching time significantly. This paper shows that having a device length of 10-nm gives switching ON and OFF times in the range of 4s - 13ns for applied voltage of 1V - 2.3V. In additon, the obtained OFF/ON switching time ratio is 3x compared to several order of magnitudes reported inliterature for device length of 50-nm. The proposed model is also used to study the effect of changing temperature, activation energy and frequency on memristor switching time.","doi":"10.1109/ICM.2014.7071806","publicationTitle":"2014 26th International Conference on Microelectronics (ICM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 26th International Conference on Microelectronics (ICM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7066216/7071786/07071806.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"63","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7071786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICM.2014.7071806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of device, size, activation energy, temperature, and frequency on memristor switching time","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071806/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Dec. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Effect of device, size, activation energy, temperature, and frequency on memristor switching time","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7071806/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15026463","conferenceDate":"14-17 Dec. 2014","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of device, size, activation energy, temperature, and frequency on memristor switching time","confLoc":"Doha, Qatar","sourcePdf":"020icmsubmission37.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059647S","chronDate":"14-17 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7066216","isNumber":"7071786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7066216","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7071786","articleId":"7071806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7071809,"authors":[{"name":"Orlando Verducci","affiliation":["Universidade Federal de Itajuba, Itajuba, MG, BR"],"firstName":"Orlando","lastName":"Verducci","id":"37085359087"},{"name":"Paulo C.

Many fields may need CS technique, but herein we are solely interested in applying it to the physiological signal acquisition systems, particularly the Electrocardiogram (ECG) biosignal. Since this signal is sparse, it is a perfect candidate for CS processing. This paper investigates the application of two greedy algorithms on ECG raw data, namely the matching pursuit (MP) and the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithms. Several tests on various ECG data sets are carried out to make the best choice of the parameters (type of dictionary, maximum number of iterations,etc) that allow a good reconstruction of the original signal. Moreover, we propose to concatenate different dictionaries which is shown to enhance the accuracy by 14 dB. The novelty lies in the choice of the dictionaries and the application of the windowing on the original data that allows to significantly reduce the size of the dictionary.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concatenation of dictionaries for recovery of ECG signals using compressed sensing techniques","publicationTitle":"2014 26th International Conference on Microelectronics (ICM)","doi":"10.1109/ICM.2014.7071819","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 26th International Conference on Microelectronics (ICM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7066216/7071786/07071819.pdf","startPage":"112","endPage":"115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICM.2014.7071819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7071786","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071819","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071819/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Dec. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Concatenation of dictionaries for recovery of ECG signals using compressed sensing techniques","conferenceDate":"14-17 Dec. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7071819/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15026438","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concatenation of dictionaries for recovery of ECG signals using compressed sensing techniques","confLoc":"Doha, Qatar","sourcePdf":"033icmsubmission63.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086016S","chronDate":"14-17 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7066216","isNumber":"7071786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7066216","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7071786","articleId":"7071819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7071821,"authors":[{"name":"Hadi Hayati","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, K.

To validate any fault tolerant solution for these SRAM-FPGA, fault injection campaigns must be conducted carefully. In this work, we present a new design flow to perform localized internal fault injection on specific parts of a Design Under Test (DUT). To achieve this, we combine between Partial Dynamic Reconfiguration (PDR) via Internal Configuration Access Port (ICAP) for rapid fault insertion on SRAM; Isolation Design Flow (IDF) to isolate both of placement and routing of Design Under Test into a specific partial region. Moreover, we applied realistic fault distribution laws deduced from ground-based radiation experiments to reflect realistic behavior of FPGA toward radiations. The implemented injection platform using this flow shows the importance of using distribution laws driven approach.

The underlying idea of this approach consists of dividing the global task of recognition into simple and well-defined sub-tasks and using hearing/perception-based cues. The sub-tasks are assigned to a set of suitable Time-Delay Neural Networks using an autoregressive version of the backpropagation algorithm (AR-TDNN). When they are incorporated in the hybrid structure, the AR-TDNN-based experts act as post-processors of a HMM-based system which thus acquires the ability to overcome failures due to complex language particularities. Results of experiments using either static or dynamic acoustic features show that the proposed HMM/AR-TDNN system outperforms that of the HMM-based system.","publicationTitle":"2002 11th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2002 11th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7067180/7067181/07071906.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7067181","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid HMM/autoregressive Time-Delay Neural Network Automatic Speech Recognition system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071906","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid HMM/autoregressive Time-Delay Neural Network Automatic Speech Recognition system","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071906/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2002","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"15024662","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7071906/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid HMM/autoregressive Time-Delay Neural Network Automatic Speech Recognition system","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"paper108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115281S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"7067180","isNumber":"7067181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7067180","xplore-issue":"7067181","articleId":"7071906","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7071912,"authors":[{"name":"Spyros Panagopoulos","affiliation":["Signal Processing Division, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland, UK"],"firstName":"Spyros","lastName":"Panagopoulos","id":"37281999400"},{"name":"John J.

Generally speaking, conventional TDICA fails to separate source signals under heavily reverberant conditions because of the low convergence in the iterative learning of the inverse of the mixing system. On the other hand, the separation performance of conventional PDICA also degrades significantly because the independence assumption of narrow-band signals collapses when the number of subbands increases. In the proposed method, the separated signals of PDICA are regarded as the input signals for TDICA, and we can remove the residual crosstalk components of PDICA by using TDICA. The experimental results obtained under the reverberant condition reveal that the separation performance of the proposed method is superior to that of conventional ICA-based BSS methods.","publicationTitle":"2002 11th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2002 11th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7067180/7067181/07071932.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7067181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of time-domain ICA, frequency-domain ICA and multistage ICA for blind source separation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7071932","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071932/","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of time-domain ICA, frequency-domain ICA and multistage ICA for blind source separation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"15024524","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7071932/","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of time-domain ICA, frequency-domain ICA and multistage ICA for blind source separation","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"paper154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052751S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"7067180","isNumber":"7067181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7067180","xplore-issue":"7067181","articleId":"7071932","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7071940,"authors":[{"name":"Jes\u00fas Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez","affiliation":["DICOM, ETSII y Telecomunicaci\u00f3n Universidad de Cantabria.

In this paper a new family of pulse shaping filters with zero intersymbol interference after matched filtering is proposed. The method, based on the spline interpolation of the symbol data, exploits two properties of splines: that the B-spline coefficients can be efficiently obtained via digital filtering, and that the B-spline kernels of order n can be constructed from the convolution of n + 1 rectangular pulses. These two facts suggest how to decompose the filtering operations needed to obtain any spline interpolation of odd-order into two matched filters. The proposed architecture allows an efficient implementation, produces optimal performance and shows better spectral characteristics than other suboptimal approaches.","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2002 11th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7067180/7067181/07071940.pdf","publicationTitle":"2002 11th European Signal Processing Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7067181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spline pulse shaping with ISI-free matched filter receiver","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2002","displayDocTitle":"Spline pulse shaping with ISI-free matched filter receiver","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7071940/","accessionNumber":"15024582","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071940/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spline pulse shaping with ISI-free matched filter receiver","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"paper168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114238S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"7067180","isNumber":"7067181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7067180","xplore-issue":"7067181","articleId":"7071940","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7071957,"authors":[{"name":"Yumang Feng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, The University of Liverpool, England, UK"],"firstName":"Yumang","lastName":"Feng","id":"37331428400"},{"name":"Vicente Zarzoso","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, The University of Liverpool, England, UK"],"firstName":"Vicente","lastName":"Zarzoso","id":"37283341300"},{"name":"Asoke K.

We have proposed a scheme to reduce degradation of the signal by selecting the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of the signal for use in forming the antenna beam. In this scheme, the degradation is considered to be caused by the delay spread of scattered waves arriving from the vicinity of the nominal DOA. However, the degradation observed in a low-ISI environment cannot be explained by this consideration. To explain degradation in a low-ISI environment, we propose a new model of scattering in which we consider signal degradation to be caused by Nakagami-Rice fading. We then apply the method to determine the DOA that provides the best quality for the signal. Some numerical results are given to verify that the proposed method is effective.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7067181","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2002 11th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7067180/7067181/07071994.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using a model of scattering in a low-intersymbol-interference channel for array beamforming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7071994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2002","htmlLink":"/document/7071994/","displayDocTitle":"Using a model of scattering in a low-intersymbol-interference channel for array beamforming","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"15024514","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using a model of scattering in a low-intersymbol-interference channel for array beamforming","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"paper267.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.142973S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"7067180","isNumber":"7067181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7067180","xplore-issue":"7067181","articleId":"7071994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7072016,"authors":[{"name":"Mihai Enescu","affiliation":["Aalto-yliopisto Insinooritieteiden korkeakoulu, Aalto, FI"],"firstName":"Mihai","lastName":"Enescu"},{"name":"Visa Koivunen","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory, Helsinki University of Technology, FINLAND"],"firstName":"Visa","lastName":"Koivunen","id":"37085364514"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2219-5491"}],"articleNumber":"7072016","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":18},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kalman smoothing based channel estimation for space-time block coding","abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of channel estimation and tracking for space-time block coding.

This paper is focused on the evaluation of the RAKE receivers when spreading sequences have short periods in a synchronous downlink transmission with multipath propagation. The bit-error-rate evaluation based on the randomness assumption of spreading codes can not be applied. We show that exact evaluation of the bit-error-rate, exploiting the sequences properties for any multipath channel profile (considering fractionally chip delayed paths) is feasible. This proposed evaluation is applied to the TD-CDMA mode of UMTS. This analytical study can be easily implemented and gives the performances for different scenarios avoiding simulations. It can also be useful to optimize the channel allocation code strategy or to evaluate the equivalent interference factor needed for capacity evaluation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Multipath channels","Bit error rate","Matched filters","Multiaccess communication","Interference","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","cellular radio","channel allocation","channel capacity","channel coding","code division multiple access","error statistics","interference suppression","mobile handsets","multipath channels","radio receivers","radiofrequency interference","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TD-CDMA downlink evaluation","multipath propagation","asynchronous transmission","intracell interference canceller","CDMA mobile handset","RAKE receiver uplink","synchronous downlink transmission","bit error rate evaluation","spreading codes","multipath channel profile","UMTS","channel allocation code strategy","equivalent interference factor evaluation","time division-code division multiple access technique","channel capacity evaluation"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7067181","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2002 11th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2002 11th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7067180/7067181/07072017.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rake receiver analytical study for TD-CDMA downlink evaluation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Rake receiver analytical study for TD-CDMA downlink evaluation","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15024692","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7072017/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072017/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rake receiver analytical study for TD-CDMA downlink evaluation","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"paper311.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063767S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"7067180","isNumber":"7067181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7067180","xplore-issue":"7067181","articleId":"7072017","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7072024,"authors":[{"name":"Marius Sirbu","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory Helsinki Univ. of Technology, FIN-02015 HUT, Finland"],"firstName":"Marius","lastName":"Sirbu","id":"37269800400"},{"name":"Visa Koivunen","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory Helsinki Univ. of Technology, FIN-02015 HUT, Finland"],"firstName":"Visa","lastName":"Koivunen","id":"37269798700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2219-5491"}],"articleNumber":"7072024","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":20},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Abstracts"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel estimation","code division multiple access","delay estimation","equalisers","gradient methods","MIMO communication","spread spectrum communication","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","propagation delay estimation","spreading codes","MIMO stochastic gradient algorithm","channel impulse response estimation","equalization","matching scheme","asynchronous DS/CDMA","multiple antenna"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of channel and propagation delay estimation in asynchronous DS/CDMA systems.

BER performance analysis evidences a clear improvement with respect to the conventional matched filter case, thus confirming the validity of the basic assumptions made about statistical properties of MUI and proposing HOS-based techniques as valuable alternatives to other state-of-the-art DS/CDMA detection algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A higher-order-statistics based blind interference cancellator for asynchronous DS/CDMA systems","publicationTitle":"2002 11th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2002 11th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7067180/7067181/07072061.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7067181","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7072061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072061/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2002","displayDocTitle":"A higher-order-statistics based blind interference cancellator for asynchronous DS/CDMA systems","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7072061/","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"15024530","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A higher-order-statistics based blind interference cancellator for asynchronous DS/CDMA systems","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"paper379.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059227S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"7067180","isNumber":"7067181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7067180","xplore-issue":"7067181","articleId":"7072061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7072065,"authors":[{"name":"Man-Wai Kwan","affiliation":["EEE Depart., Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, HONG KONG"],"lastName":"Man-Wai Kwan","id":"37087311584"},{"name":"Chi-Wah Kok","affiliation":["EEE Depart., Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, HONG KONG"],"lastName":"Chi-Wah Kok","id":"37087207438"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2219-5491"}],"articleNumber":"7072065","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":17},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filter banks","Finite impulse response filters","Abstracts","Multiplexing","Silicon","Equalizers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","equalisers","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel precoder","amplification effect","nonuniform sampling equalizer","equalizer pair","ordinary linear precoder"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7072065","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7067181","publicationTitle":"2002 11th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2002 11th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7067180/7067181/07072065.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel precoder with nonuniform sampling equalizer","abstract":"A class of channel precoder constructed with equalizer with minimal implementation complexity, and no channel noise amplification effect is proposed in this paper.

For WCDMA downlink, multiple access interference (MAI) suppression by symbol-level equalization has proven to be problematic due to long spreading sequences employed in downlink. To circumvent the problem, receivers based on channel equalization at chip level have been proposed to ensure adequate performance even with a high number of active users.

The SVD is used to identify and eliminate redundant hidden nodes. Minimizing redundancy gives smaller networks, producing models that generalize better and thus eliminate the need of using cross-validation to avoid overfitting. Using this procedure we obtain a final model with fewer adjustable parameters and more accurate predictions than a network model with a fixed, a priori determined, size. We show these performances by applying this procedure to several problems such as function approximation and image recognition.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072217/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15024644","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7072217/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A new Neural Network pruning method based on the singular value decomposition and the weight initialisation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new Neural Network pruning method based on the singular value decomposition and the weight initialisation","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"paper664.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042283S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"7067180","isNumber":"7067181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7067180","xplore-issue":"7067181","articleId":"7072217","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7072232,"authors":[{"name":"Dieter Schafhuber","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Radio-Frequency Engineering, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Dieter","lastName":"Schafhuber","id":"37283476000"},{"name":"Gerald Matz","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Radio-Frequency Engineering, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Gerald","lastName":"Matz","id":"37085703135"},{"name":"Franz Hlawatsch","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Radio-Frequency Engineering, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Franz","lastName":"Hlawatsch","id":"37085668223"},{"name":"Philippe Loubaton","affiliation":["Equipe Signal pour les Communications, Institut Gaspard Monge et Laboratoire Traitement et Communication de l'Information (URA-820 CNRS, ENST) Universit\u00e9 de Marne la Vall\u00e9e 5, Boulevard Descartes, Marne la Vall\u00e9e Cedex 2, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Loubaton","id":"37272064400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2219-5491"}],"articleNumber":"7072232","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":61},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital video broadcasting","Channel estimation","Scattering","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel estimation","cochannel interference","digital video broadcasting","least mean squares methods","television antennas","television receivers","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-varying vector channel MMSE estimation","cochannel interference","minimum mean square channel estimator","multiantenna DVB-T receiver","scattered pilot symbol","blockwise fashion","time-delay domain","reference method"]}],"abstract":"We present a minimum mean-square error (MMSE) channel estimator for a multi-antenna DVB-T receiver in the presence of strong co-channel interference.

In this design, the physical resources are used in an optimum way and the Multiple Access Interference (MAI) is minimized. The proposed technique is a variant of the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm, which is able to find the global optimum.

The satellite payload is regenerative. So, we use a predistortion on board to linearize the amplifier. We present the predistortion architecture realized with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Networks (NN). Two algorithms associated to that predistorter are shown and compared: the ordinary and the natural gradient. The major problem to implement that predistorter is to get enough bandwidth (100 Mbits/s data rate). A mixed analog/digital implementation is one solution to solve it.

The converter consists of a set of fast electronic switches and a small three-phase LC-filter. It permits the control of the load current while maintaining almost sinusoidal currents at zero phase displacement in the mains. An analysis of the circuit leads to the definition of a complex transfer vector k which governs the interaction between the ac side and the de side. During operation the modulus and the argument of the transfer vector are varied using a special amplitude and angle modulation technique for complex quantities. To facilitate closed loop control the state variables of the system are subjected to a coordinate transformation. The transformed variables are processed in a multiloop control system so as to maintain the desired operating conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 1982","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 1982","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"14-17 June 1982","displayDocTitle":"Multiloop control of a unity power factor fast switching AC to DC converter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiloop control of a unity power factor fast switching AC to DC converter","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"171179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026346S","chronDate":"14-17 June 1982","isNumber":"7065152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7065151","citationCount":"72","articleId":"7072407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7072414,"authors":[{"name":"Robert W.

More precisely, in this paper, we characterize the second-order coding rates of the Gaussian interference channel in the strictly very strong interference regime. In other words, we characterize the speed of convergence of rates of optimal block codes toward a boundary point of the (rectangular) capacity region.

Consequently, non-linearities may appear at the PA output in the transmission chain. To compensate these distortions, one solution consists of using a digital detector based on a Volterra model of both the PA and the channel and a Kalman filter (KF) based algorithm to jointly estimate the Volterra kernels and the transmitted symbols. Here, we suggest addressing this issue when dealing with cognitive radio (CR). In this case, additional constraints must be taken into account. Since the CR terminal may switch from one sub-band to another, the PA non-linearities may vary over time. Therefore, we propose to design a digital detector based on an interacting multiple model combining various KF based estimators using different model parameter dynamics. This makes it possible to track the time variations of the Volterra kernels while keeping accurate estimates when those parameters are static. Furthermore, the single and multicarrier cases are addressed and validated by simulation results. Our solution corresponds to a compromise between computational cost and bit-error-rate performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072456/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"63","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15142304","htmlLink":"/document/7072456/","displayDocTitle":"Interacting Multiple Model Based Detector to Compensate Power Amplifier Distortions in Cognitive Radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interacting Multiple Model Based Detector to Compensate Power Amplifier Distortions in Cognitive Radio","sourcePdf":"tcomm-benmabrouk-2417552-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109102S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7108080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7108080","articleId":"7072456","onlineDate":"30 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7072461,"authors":[{"name":"Ozlem Ozgun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7115198/7072461/ozgun-2417583-small.gif","p":["Ozlem Ozgun (M\u201905\u2013SM\u201913) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical and electronics engineering from Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey, in 1998 and 2001, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from the Middle East Technical University (METU), Ankara, Turkey, in 2007.","She is currently an Associate Professor with Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.

The double-sided LCC compensation topology for wireless power transfer (WPT) has been proved to be one of the efficient solutions lately. However, with the increase of the numbers of compensation components, the volume of the system may become larger, which makes it less attractive. To improve the compactness, a bipolar coupler structure with a compensation-integrated feature is proposed. The inductors of the LCC compensation networks are designed as planar-type and attached to the power-transferring main coils. Extra space and magnetic cores for the compensated inductors outside of the coupler are saved. The cost is that extra couplings between the compensated coils (inductors) and the main coils are induced. To validate the feasibility, the proposed coupler is modeled and investigated by 3-D finite-element analysis tool first. The positioning of the compensated coils, the range of the extra couplings, and the tolerance to misalignment are studied. This is followed by the circuit modeling and characteristic analysis of the proposed WPT topology based on the fundamental harmonic approximation. At last, a 600 mm \u00d7 600 mm with a nominal 150-mm-gap wireless charger prototype, operated at a resonant frequency of 95 kHz and a rated power of 5.6 kW has been built and tested. A peak efficiency of 95.36% from a dc power source to the battery load is achieved at rated operation condition.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact and Efficient Bipolar Coupler for Wireless Power Chargers: Design and Analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2417115","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7154538/07072471.pdf","startPage":"6130","endPage":"6140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2417115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7154538","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7072471","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/63/7154538/7072471-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072471/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 March 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Compact and Efficient Bipolar Coupler for Wireless Power Chargers: Design and Analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7072471/","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15289522","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"U.S. Department of Energy Graduate Automotive Technology Education"},{"fundingName":"U.S.\u2013China Clean Energy Research Center\u2014Clean Vehicle Consortium"},{"fundingName":"DENSO International"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007270","fundingName":"University of Michigan"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Compact and Efficient Bipolar Coupler for Wireless Power Chargers: Design and Analysis","sourcePdf":"tpel-mi-2417115-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092152S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7154538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"7154538","articleId":"7072471","onlineDate":"30 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7072473,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404141100"},{"name":"Jianhui Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Jianhui","lastName":"Hu","id":"38467739200"},{"name":"Juan Zhang","affiliation":["Industrial Technology Research Institute, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38490646600"},{"name":"Chengjun Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Chengjun","lastName":"Liu","id":"38489075200"},{"name":"Yong Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Li","id":"37695830100"},{"name":"Jibin Zou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Jibin","lastName":"Zou","id":"37401906600"},{"name":"Hui Zhao","affiliation":["School of Astronautics, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37877063800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0093-3813"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9375"}],"articleNumber":"7072473","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":398},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"abstract":"Due to the achievable high force densities, permanent magnet linear machines with transverse flux configurations are gaining increased interest in electromagnetic launch (EML) applications, in which the force density demand is crucial. This paper deals with the design of a tubular transverse flux linear machine (TFLM) targeting EML applications, and the issues pertinent to its topology selection, design optimization, and thermal modeling are discussed. By overall comparison of practical topologies and technologies of the TFLM, a tubular moving-magnet topology with separated flux paths is believed to be more appropriate. Design optimization is then performed to maximize the thrust force under specific volumetric constraints. It is shown that the thrust force is more sensitive to the stator segment length, instead of the magnet thickness. Regarding the overload requirement inherent in EML systems, special focus is given on the thermal characteristics of the TFLM at overload conditions, and it is proved that the machine shows appreciable overload capability. Measurements carried out on a prototype TFLM have validated the predictions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force","Topology","Windings","Heating","Stators","Plasma temperature"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic launchers","linear machines","permanent magnet machines","stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic launch applications","design considerations","EML applications","permanent magnet machines","force densities","tubular transverse flux linear machine","TFLM","topology selection","design optimization","thermal modeling","tubular moving-magnet topology","flux paths","thrust force","specific volumetric constraints","stator segment length","overload conditions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electromagnetic launch (EML)","linear machine","optimization","thermal modeling","transverse flux machine."]},{"kwd":["Electromagnetic launch (EML)","linear machine","optimization","thermal modeling","transverse flux machine"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPS.2015.2413772","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/27/7102802/07072473.pdf","startPage":"1248","endPage":"1253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7102802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPS.2015.2413772","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design Considerations of Tubular Transverse Flux Linear Machines for Electromagnetic Launch Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7072473","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design Considerations of Tubular Transverse Flux Linear Machines for Electromagnetic Launch Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072473/","volume":"43","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7072473/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15108006","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 March 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51407047 and 51107013"},{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB035600"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014M551241"},{"fundingName":"Post-Doctoral Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province","grantNumber":"LBH-Z14112"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"HIT.NSRIF.2013017"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Considerations of Tubular Transverse Flux Linear Machines for Electromagnetic Launch Applications","sourcePdf":"tps-wang-2413772-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055705S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"27","isNumber":"7102802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7102802","articleId":"7072473","onlineDate":"30 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7072483,"authors":[{"name":"Yan-Jun Liu","affiliation":["College of Science, Liaoning University of Technology, Jinzhou, Liaoning, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/7396984/7072483/liu-small.gif","p":["Yan-Jun Liu received the B.S. degree in applied mathematics and the\n M.S. degree in control theory and control engineering from the Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang, China, in\n 2001 and 2004, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from the Dalian University\n of Technology, Dalian, China, in 2007.","He is currently a Professor with the College of Science, Liaoning University of Technology, Jinzhou, China.

The controlled systems are in a strict-feedback frame and contain unknown functions and nonsymmetric dead-zone. For this class of systems, the control objective is to design a controller, which not only guarantees the stability of the systems, but achieves the optimal control performance as well. This immediately brings about the difficulties in the controller design. To this end, the fuzzy logic systems are employed to approximate the unknown functions in the systems. Based on the utility functions and the critic designs, and by applying the backsteppping design technique, a reinforcement learning algorithm is used to develop an optimal control signal. The adaptation auxiliary signal for unknown dead-zone parameters is established to compensate for the effect of nonsymmetric dead-zone on the control performance, and the updating laws are obtained based on the gradient descent rule. The stability of the control systems can be proved based on the difference Lyapunov function method. The feasibility of the proposed control approach is further demonstrated via two simulation examples.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/7396984/07072483.pdf","startPage":"16","endPage":"28","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2015.2418000","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2015.2418000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7396984","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7072483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy Approximation-Based Adaptive Backstepping Optimal Control for a Class of Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems With Dead-Zone","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive systems","Optimal control","Discrete-time systems","Stability analysis","Nonlinear systems","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","approximation theory","control nonlinearities","control system synthesis","discrete time systems","feedback","fuzzy control","fuzzy logic","learning (artificial intelligence)","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","optimal control","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy approximation","adaptive backstepping optimal control","nonlinear discrete-time systems","dead-zone","adaptive fuzzy optimal control","strict-feedback frame","stability","controller design","fuzzy logic systems","reinforcement learning algorithm","gradient descent rule"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive fuzzy control","reinforcement learning","nonlinear systems","optimal control","dead-zone input"]},{"kwd":["Adaptive fuzzy control","dead-zone input","nonlinear systems","optimal control","reinforcement learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072483/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy Approximation-Based Adaptive Backstepping Optimal Control for a Class of Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems With Dead-Zone","volume":"24","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7072483/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15755358","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61473139 and 61374113"},{"fundingName":"Program for Liaoning Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"LR2014016"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy Approximation-Based Adaptive Backstepping Optimal Control for a Class of Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems With Dead-Zone","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-liu-2418000-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118356S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"7396984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"311","xplore-issue":"7396984","articleId":"7072483","onlineDate":"30 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7072487,"authors":[{"name":"Chang-Yeong Oh","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Samsung Electronics, Suwon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7182829/7072487/oh-2417873_print-small.gif","p":["\nChang-Yeong Oh received the B.S. degree in electronics, electrical and \ncomputer engineering from Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea, in February 2008, the M.S. degree in mobile systems \nengineering from Sungkyunkwan University, Korea, in February 2010, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Mobile \nSystems Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Korea, in February 2014.

M2M communications normally involve a large number of MTC devices (MTCDs) to support a variety of sensor applications. Consequently, concurrent and massive access attempts of MTCDs to radio access networks (RANs) may cause intolerable delay, packet loss, and even service unavailability. In this paper, we propose a joint optimal physical random access channel (PRACH) resource allocation and access control mechanism to address the performance degradation caused by concurrent and massive access attempts of MTCDs in LTE systems. We define the notion of random access efficiency and formulate an optimization problem for maximization of the random access efficiency with random access delay constraint. We also propose a dynamic resource allocation and access control algorithm based on estimation of the number of MTCDs for a system with dynamically varying numbers of massive MTCDs. Then, an analytical model is provided using a discrete-time Markov chain for the proposed mechanism. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated via analysis and simulations. The proposed algorithm was able to maintain the optimal random access efficiency while satisfying the average random access delay requirement of MTCDs to handle massive and dynamic MTCDs per cell.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2417873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7182829","startPage":"4182","endPage":"4192","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7182829/07072487.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2417873","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Access Control and Resource Allocation for Concurrent and Massive Access of M2M Devices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Access control","Delays","Educational Activities Board","Heuristic algorithms","Estimation","Radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","access control","Long Term Evolution","Markov processes","optimisation","radio access networks","resource allocation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint access control and resource allocation","M2M devices massive access","M2M device concurrent access","machine-to-machine communication","machine-type communication","MTC","3GPP LTE system","radio access network","RAN","packet loss","PRACH resource allocation","joint optimal physical random access channel resource allocation","random access efficiency","optimization problem","random access efficiency maximization","random access delay constraint","discrete-time Markov chain","Long Term Evolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["M2M communications","dynamic resource allocation","access control","random access efficiency","optimization"]},{"kwd":["M2M communications","dynamic resource allocation","access control","random access efficiency","optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Joint Access Control and Resource Allocation for Concurrent and Massive Access of M2M Devices","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072487/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 March 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7072487/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15364387","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Access Control and Resource Allocation for Concurrent and Massive Access of M2M Devices","sourcePdf":"twc-lee-2417873-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081317S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7182829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"7182829","articleId":"7072487","onlineDate":"30 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7072489,"authors":[{"name":"Moe Win","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Center of Advanced Manufacturing and Material Processing (AMMP), University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/7116638/7072489/mowin-2417676-small.gif","p":["Moe Win (S\u201915) received the B.Sc. degree (Hons.) in chemistry from Taungoo University (affiliated with Yangon University), Taungoo, Myanmar, in 2006, and the M.Sc. degree in chemical engineering from the Department of Technology of Isotopes and Hydrogen Energy, Mendeleyev University of Chemical Technology of Russia (MUCTR), Moscow, Russia, in 2011.

In this study, two new thresholding methods, namely contrast-adjusted Otsu's method and contrast-adjusted median-based Otsu's method, are proposed for automated defect detection system for titanium-coated aluminum surfaces. The two proposed methods were compared with four existing thresholding techniques in terms of accuracy and speed of defect detections for images of 700, 900, and 1000 dpi obtained using high-resolution scanning. Experimental results have shown that the proposed contrast-adjusting methods have performance similar to minimum error thresholding (MET) and are generally better than Otsu's method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072489/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7072489/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15215264","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"3","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Contrast Adjustment Thresholding Method for Surface Defect Detection Based on Mesoscopy","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002385","fundingName":"Ministry of Higher Education with High Impact Research","grantNumber":"UM.C/625/1/HIR/MOHE/ENG/27"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004532","fundingName":"Japan International Cooperation Agency"},{"fundingName":"AUN/SEED-Net Collaborative Research with Industry","grantNumber":"PG116-2013A and RP017-2012A"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Contrast Adjustment Thresholding Method for Surface Defect Detection Based on Mesoscopy","sourcePdf":"tii-hassan-2417676-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09127S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"7116638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"7116638","articleId":"7072489","onlineDate":"30 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7072490,"authors":[{"name":"Jihyuck Jo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Jihyuck","lastName":"Jo","id":"37074331100"},{"name":"Hoyoung Yoo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Hoyoung","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37711054700"},{"name":"In-Cheol Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"In-Cheol","lastName":"Park","id":"37270580300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"7072490","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1072},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","Feature extraction","Speech recognition","Table lookup","Hardware","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cepstral analysis","feature extraction","floating point arithmetic","nonlinear functions","speech recognition","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient floating-point MFCC feature extraction architecture","mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients","real-time speech recognition systems","floating-point arithmetic units","operational bit-width","lookup tables","nonlinear functions","trigonometric functions","logarithmic functions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Floating-point operations","hardware optimization","mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCCs)","speech recognition."]},{"kwd":["Floating-point operations","hardware optimization","mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCCs)","speech recognition"]}],"abstract":"This brief presents an energy-efficient architecture to extract mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCCs) for real-time speech recognition systems.

However, facing the numerous cloud vendors as well as their heterogenous pricing policies, customers maywell be perplexed with which cloud(s) are suitable for storing their data and what hosting strategy is cheaper.The general status quo is that customers usually put their data into a single cloud (which is subject to the vendor lock-in risk) and then simply trust to luck. Based on comprehensive analysis of various state-of-the-art cloud vendors, this paper proposes a novel data hosting scheme (named CHARM) which integrates two key functions desired. The first is selecting several suitable clouds and an appropriate redundancy strategy to store data with minimized monetary cost and guaranteed availability. The second is triggering a transition process to re-distribute data according to the variations of data access pattern and pricing of clouds. We evaluate the performance of CHARM using both trace-driven simulations and prototype experiments. The results show that compared with the major existing schemes, CHARM not only saves around 20 percent of monetary cost but also exhibits sound adaptability to data and price adjustments.","doi":"10.1109/TCC.2015.2417534","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245519/7235007/07072495.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCC.2015.2417534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7235007","startPage":"372","endPage":"386","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/07072495.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CHARM: A Cost-Efficient Multi-Cloud Data Hosting Scheme with High Availability","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7072495","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"CHARM: A Cost-Efficient Multi-Cloud Data Hosting Scheme with High Availability","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept. 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072495/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 March 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","issue":"3","publicationDate":"1 July-Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15415843","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7072495/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2011CB302305"},{"fundingName":"High-Tech Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2015AA01A201"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"61232004 and 61471217"},{"fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Fund","grantNumber":"2014M550735"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CHARM: A Cost-Efficient Multi-Cloud Data Hosting Scheme with High Availability","sourcePdf":"tcc-zhang-2417534-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134378S","chronDate":"July-Sept. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"6245519","isNumber":"7235007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245519","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"7235007","articleId":"7072495","onlineDate":"30 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7072496,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7386794/7072496/liu-2412958-small.gif","p":["Qiang Liu (M\u201914) received the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, U.K., in 2008.","He was a Research Associate with the Department of Computing, Imperial College London, from 2009 to 2011.

Then the beamforming vectors, which in addition satisfy other desired properties that the mother beamforming vector may not satisfy, can be selected. Such procedure is developed in this letter in the application to the transmit beamspace design that ensures practically important properties for multiple-input multiple-output radar.

The fuzzy system is based on the Takagi-Sugeno model that is often used to represent the complex nonlinear systems in terms of fuzzy sets and fuzzy reasoning. To reflect more realistic dynamical behaviors of the system, the parameter uncertainties, the stochastic disturbances, and nonlinearities are considered, where the parameter uncertainties enter into all the system matrices, the stochastic disturbances are given in the form of a Brownian motion. The mixed delays comprise both discrete and distributed time-varying delays. By taking the relationship among the time delays, their lower and upper bounds into account, some less conservative linear-matrix-inequality-based delay-dependent passivity criteria are obtained without ignoring any useful terms in the derivative of Lyapunov functional. Finally, numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/7337513/07072505.pdf","startPage":"2284","endPage":"2301","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2015.2417913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2015.2417913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7337513","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7072505","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Criteria of Passivity Analysis for Fuzzy Time-Delay Systems With Parameter Uncertainties","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Stochastic processes","Uncertain systems","Nonlinear systems","Fuzzy systems","Stochastic systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Brownian motion","delays","discrete time systems","fuzzy control","fuzzy set theory","linear matrix inequalities","nonlinear systems","stochastic systems","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["passivity analysis","fuzzy time-delay system","parameter uncertainty","uncertain stochastic fuzzy nonlinear system","nonlinear noise disturbance","free-weighting matrix approach","Takagi-Sugeno model","fuzzy set","fuzzy reasoning","Brownian motion","discrete time-varying delay","distributed time-varying delay","linear-matrix-inequality","Lyapunov functional"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Passivity","time delay","noise disturbance","mixed delay"]},{"kwd":["Mixed delay","noise disturbance","passivity","time delay"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072505/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"New Criteria of Passivity Analysis for Fuzzy Time-Delay Systems With Parameter Uncertainties","volume":"23","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7072505/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15618738","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61125303, 61403152 and 61402218"},{"fundingName":"Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University of China","grantNumber":"IRT1245"},{"fundingName":"Australian Research Council Discovery Scheme","grantNumber":"140100544"},{"fundingName":"NPRP","grantNumber":"4-1162-1-181"},{"fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Criteria of Passivity Analysis for Fuzzy Time-Delay Systems With Parameter Uncertainties","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-zeng-2417913-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138158S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"7337513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7337513","articleId":"7072505","onlineDate":"30 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7072507,"authors":[{"name":"Louay Bazzi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon"],"bio":{"p":["Louay Bazzi received his Ph.D. degree from the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT in 2003.

[11] asked whether the performance of the linear programming (LP) decoder can be improved by adding redundant parity checks to tighten the LP relaxation. We prove in this paper that for low-density parity-check codes, even if we include all redundant parity checks, asymptotically there is no gain in the LP decoder threshold on the binary symmetric channel under certain conditions on the base Tanner graph. First, we show that if the Tanner graph has bounded check-degree and satisfies a condition which we call asymptotic strength, then including high degree redundant parity checks in the LP does not significantly improve the threshold of the LP decoder in the following sense. For each constant \u03b4 > 0, there is a constant k > 0 such that the threshold of the LP decoder containing all redundant checks of degree at most k improves by at most \u03b4 upon adding to the LP all redundant checks of degree larger thank. We conclude that if the graph satisfies an additional condition which we call rigidity, then including all redundant checks does not improve the threshold of the base LP. We call the graph asymptotically strong if the LP decoder corrects a constant fraction of errors even if the log-likelihood-ratios of the correct variables are arbitrarily small. By building on a construction due Feldman et al. [9] and its recent improvement by Viderman [24], we show that asymptotic strength follows from sufficiently large variable-to-check expansion. We also give a geometric interpretation of asymptotic strength in terms pseudocodewords. We call the graph rigid if the minimum weight of a sum of check nodes involving a cycle tends to infinity as the block length tends to infinity. Under the assumptions that the graph girth is logarithmic and the minimum check degree is at least 3, rigidity is equivalent to the nondegeneracy property that adding at least logarithmically many checks does not give a constant weight check.

In particular, we investigate techniques for achievability that are based on either decomposition with asymptotic interference alignment or linear beamforming schemes and show that there are distinct regimes of (G,K,M,N) , where one outperforms the other. We first note that both one-sided and two-sided decomposition with asymptotic interference alignment achieve the same DoF. We then establish specific antenna configurations under which the DoF achieved using decomposition-based schemes is optimal by deriving a set of outer bounds on the symmetric DoF. Using these results, we completely characterize the optimal DoF of any G-cell network with single-antenna users. For linear beamforming schemes, we first focus on small networks and propose a structured approach to linear beamforming based on a notion called packing ratios. Packing ratio describes the interference footprint or shadow cast by a set of transmit beamformers and enables us to identify the underlying structures for aligning interference. Such a structured beamforming design can be shown to achieve the optimal spatially normalized DoF (sDoF) of two-cell two-user/cell network and the two-cell three-user/cell network. For larger networks, we develop an unstructured approach to linear interference alignment, where transmit beamformers are designed to satisfy conditions for interference alignment without explicitly identifying the underlying structures for interference alignment. The main numerical insight of this paper is that such an approach appears to be capable of achieving the optimal sDoF for MIMO cellular networks in regimes where linear beamforming dominates asymptotic decomposition, and a significant portion of sDoF elsewhere. Remarkably, polynomial identity test appears to play a key role in identifying the boundary of the achievable sDoF region in the former case.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7109216/07072511.pdf","startPage":"3339","endPage":"3364","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2015.2417875","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2015.2417875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7109216","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7072511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Degrees of Freedom of MIMO Cellular Networks: Decomposition and Linear Beamforming Design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Array signal processing","Interference channels","Antennas","Transmitters","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cellular radio","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symmetric degrees of freedom","MIMO cellular networks","linear beamforming design","multiple-input multiple-output networks","base station","asymptotic interference alignment","one-sided decomposition","two-sided decomposition","specific antenna configurations","single-antenna users","structured approach","packing ratios","interference footprint","shadow cast","transmit beamformers","optimal spatially normalized DoF","sDoF","two-cell three-user","unstructured approach","linear interference alignment","asymptotic decomposition","polynomial identity test"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cellular Networks","MIMO","Degrees of Freedom","Interference Alignment","Beamforming"]},{"kwd":["Cellular networks","MIMO","degrees of freedom","interference alignment","beamforming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072511/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Degrees of Freedom of MIMO Cellular Networks: Decomposition and Linear Beamforming Design","volume":"61","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7072511/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15142277","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Degrees of Freedom of MIMO Cellular Networks: Decomposition and Linear Beamforming Design","sourcePdf":"tit-sridharan-2417875-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115378S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7109216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7109216","articleId":"7072511","onlineDate":"30 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7072518,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37423377200"},{"name":"Zhigang Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhigang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37278570100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7072518","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":367},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"A spatially modulated Diagonal Space Time Coding (SM-DC) scheme for four transmit antennas is presented in this letter.

The power control problem is first modeled as a stochastic game and the existence of the Nash Equilibrium is proven. Then, we extend the formulated stochastic game to a mean field game (MFG) considering a highly dense network. An MFG is a special type of differential game which is ideal for modeling the interactions among a large number of entities. We analyze the performance of two different cost functions for the mean field game formulation. Both of these cost functions are designed using stochastic geometry analysis in such a way that the cost functions are valid for the MFG setting. A finite difference algorithm is then developed based on the Lax-Friedrichs scheme and Lagrange relaxation to solve the corresponding MFG. Each small cell base station can independently execute the proposed algorithm offline, i.e., prior to data transmission. The output of the algorithm shows how each small cell base station should adjust its transmit power in order to minimize the cost over a predefined period of time. Moreover, sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of the mean field equilibrium for a generic cost function are also given. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated via numerical results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072519/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 March 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 1 2016","publicationDate":"1 Feb. 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7072519/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2016","accessionNumber":"15689299","volume":"15","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Downlink Power Control in Self-Organizing Dense Small Cells Underlaying Macrocells: A Mean Field Game","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink Power Control in Self-Organizing Dense Small Cells Underlaying Macrocells: A Mean Field Game","sourcePdf":"tmc-hossain-2417880-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160969S","chronDate":"Feb. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"7373720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7373720","articleId":"7072519","onlineDate":"30 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7072521,"authors":[{"name":"Chang Xu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/7308134/7072521/xu-small.gif","p":["Chang Xu received the BE degree from Tianjin University, Tianjin,\n China, in 2011.

Therefore, integration of multi-view information is both valuable and necessary. In this paper, we propose the Multi-view Intact Space Learning (MISL) algorithm, which integrates the encoded complementary information in multiple views to discover a latent intact representation of the data. Even though each view on its own is insufficient, we show theoretically that by combing multiple views we can obtain abundant information for latent intact space learning. Employing the Cauchy loss (a technique used in statistical learning) as the error measurement strengthens robustness to outliers. We propose a new definition of multi-view stability and then derive the generalization error bound based on multi-view stability and Rademacher complexity, and show that the complementarity between multiple views is beneficial for the stability and generalization. MISL is efficiently optimized using a novel Iteratively Reweight Residuals (IRR) technique, whose convergence is theoretically analyzed. Experiments on synthetic data and real-world datasets demonstrate that MISL is an effective and promising algorithm for practical applications.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7308134","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/7308134/07072521.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2417578","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2417578","startPage":"2531","endPage":"2544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-View Intact Space Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 March 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072521/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-View Intact Space Learning","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7072521/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"37","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"15568322","pubMedId":"26539856","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2015","publicationDate":"1 Dec. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Australian Research Council Projects","grantNumber":"FT-130101457 and DP-140102164"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61375026, 2015BAF15B00 and JCYJ 20120614152136201"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-View Intact Space Learning","sourcePdf":"tpami-tao-2417578-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102274S","chronDate":"Dec. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"7308134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"272","xplore-issue":"7308134","articleId":"7072521","onlineDate":"30 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7072526,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Gonzales","affiliation":["RAND Corporation, Arlington, VA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245519/8024042/7072526/gonza-2415794-small.gif","p":["Daniel Gonzales received the BS degree in physics from Stanford University in 1979, and the PhD degree in theoretical physics from MIT in 1985.

Results show the probability of CCS penetration (high value data compromise) is high if a minimal set of security controls are implemented.

While the effect of the TCSI on the MIMO channel capacity is well known, its impact on the achievable energy-efficiency is still not well determined. In this paper, we address this issue by studying the energy consumption of the singular value decomposition (SVD), beamforming, zero forcing and generalized Alamouti MIMO schemes. Although TCSI provides important savings in long-range communications, our results suggest that it is not critical when transmitting over short link distances. Results also show that large antenna arrays using schemes with a large diversity gain are energy-optimal for transmitting data over long transmission distances, while small arrays using schemes with a large multiplexing gain are more energy-efficient for performing short-range communications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of the Channel State Information on the Energy-Efficiency of MIMO Communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2417530","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7182829/07072539.pdf","startPage":"4156","endPage":"4169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2417530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7182829","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7072539","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072539/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 March 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Impact of the Channel State Information on the Energy-Efficiency of MIMO Communications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7072539/","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15364418","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"CONICYT of Chile with projects 15110017 FONDAP 2011 and FONDEF IT13i20015"},{"fundingName":"F+ fellowship from KU Leuven"},{"fundingName":"SBO project SINS, funded by the Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology IWT (Belgium)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of the Channel State Information on the Energy-Efficiency of MIMO Communications","sourcePdf":"twc-rosas-2417530-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096257S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7182829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7182829","articleId":"7072539","onlineDate":"30 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7072553,"authors":[{"name":"Daniele Leonardis","affiliation":["PERCRO Laboratory, TeCIP Institute, Scuola Superiore Sant\u2019Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4543165/7127091/7072553/leona-small.gif","p":["Daniele Leonardis received the BS and MS degrees in automation\n engineering from the Politecnico of Bari, Italy, in 2007 and 2009, respectively, and the PhD degree in innovative\n technologies from PERCRO Laboratory, Scuola Superiore Sant\u2019Anna, Pisa, Italy, in 2015.

The developed hand exoskeleton was designed with two distinctive features: (a) kinematics with intrinsic adaptability to patient's hand size, and (b) free-palm and free-fingertip design, preserving the residual sensory perceptual capability of touch during assistance in grasping of real objects. In the envisaged bilateral training strategy, the patient's non paretic hand acted as guidance for the paretic hand in grasping tasks. Grasping force exerted by the non paretic hand was estimated in real-time from EMG signals, and then replicated as robotic assistance for the paretic hand by means of the hand-exoskeleton. Estimation of the grasping force through EMG allowed to perform rehabilitation exercises with any, non sensorized, graspable objects. This paper presents the system design, development, and experimental evaluation. Experiments were performed within a group of six healthy subjects and two chronic stroke patients, executing robotic-assisted grasping tasks. Results related to performance in estimation and modulation of the robotic assistance, and to the outcomes of the pilot rehabilitation sessions with stroke patients, positively support validity of the proposed approach for application in stroke rehabilitation.","doi":"10.1109/TOH.2015.2417570","pdfPath":"/iel7/4543165/7127091/07072553.pdf","startPage":"140","endPage":"151","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Haptics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Haptics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TOH.2015.2417570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7127091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An EMG-Controlled Robotic Hand Exoskeleton for Bilateral Rehabilitation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072553/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June 1 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"An EMG-Controlled Robotic Hand Exoskeleton for Bilateral Rehabilitation","volume":"8","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15219307","pubMedId":"25838528","publicationDate":"1 April-June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7072553/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004963","fundingName":"Seventh Framework Programme","grantNumber":"601165 WEARHAP"},{"fundingName":"Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia IIT Seed Research Program","grantNumber":"BRAVO"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An EMG-Controlled Robotic Hand Exoskeleton for Bilateral Rehabilitation","sourcePdf":"toh-loconsole-2417570-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144177S","chronDate":"April-June 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"4543165","isNumber":"7127091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4543165","citationCount":"148","xplore-issue":"7127091","articleId":"7072553","onlineDate":"30 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7072555,"authors":[{"name":"Annan Li","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/7374781/7072555/li-small.gif","p":["Annan Li received the BS and MS degrees in computer science from the\n Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2003 and 2006, and the PhD degree in computer science from Institute\n of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2011.

However, most tracking algorithms are evaluated on limited video sequences and annotations. For thorough performance evaluation, we propose a large-scale database which contains 365 challenging image sequences of pedestrians and rigid objects.

In modern day communication systems, the most popular frequency band is Radio Frequency (RF) mainly due to little interference and good coverage. However, the rapidly dwindling RF spectrum along with increasing wireless network traffic has substantiated the need for greater bandwidth and spectral relief. By combining illumination and communication, VLC provides ubiquitous communication while addressing the shortfalls and limitations of RF communication. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on VLC with an emphasis on challenges faced in indoor applications over the period 1979-2014. VLC is compared with infrared (IR) and RF systems and the necessity for using this beneficial technology in communication systems is justified. The advantages of LEDs compared to traditional lighting technologies are discussed and comparison is done between different types of LEDs currently available. Modulation schemes and dimming techniques for indoor VLC are discussed in detail. Methods needed to improve VLC system performance such as filtering, equalization, compensation, and beamforming are also presented. The recent progress made by various research groups in this field is discussed along with the possible applications of this technology. Finally, the limitations of VLC as well as the probable future directions are presented.","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2015.2417576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7214344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2015.2417576","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/7214344/07072557.pdf","startPage":"1649","endPage":"1678","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LED Based Indoor Visible Light Communications: State of the Art","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"LED Based Indoor Visible Light Communications: State of the Art","volume":"17","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"thirdquarter  2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7072557/","publicationDate":"thirdquarter 2015","accessionNumber":"15383359","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072557/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Centre for Collaborative Research in Engineering, Science and Technology (CREST)","grantNumber":"P23C113"},{"fundingName":"Advanced Engineering Platform of Monash University Malaysia"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LED Based Indoor Visible Light Communications: State of the Art","sourcePdf":"comst-parthiban-2417576-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.458729S","chronDate":"thirdquarter  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7214344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"468","xplore-issue":"7214344","articleId":"7072557","onlineDate":"30 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7072559,"authors":[{"name":"Xuemin Hong","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, School of Information Science and Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7182829/7072559/hong-2417550-small.gif","p":["\n\nXuemin Hong (S'05\u2013M'12) received the Ph.D. degree from \nHeriot-Watt University, U.K., in 2008.

The fundamental properties of such hybrid systems, however, have not been thoroughly investigated. This paper studies the hybrid cognitive Gaussian relay channel (HCGRC), which uses licensed radio resource (RR) and cognitive/unlicensed RR for forward and relay transmissions, respectively. HCGRC fundamentally differs from conventional relay channels in that the licensed and cognitive RRs are not subject to a total resource constraint and that the cognitive RR is opportunistic in nature. With respect to both the upper and lower bounds, we derive the optimal power-bandwidth allocation strategies for the cognitive relay to maximize the capacity, spectrum efficiency (SE), and energy efficiency (EE). The Pareto-optimal EE-SE tradeoff curve is also derived analytically. Our study leads to two key observations. First, the multi-objective power-bandwidth allocation problem is characterized by five regions, each representing a unique performance tradeoff. Second, the reliability of cognitive RR has no impact on the EE-SE tradeoff given unlimited bandwidth and power.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072559/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 March 2015","volume":"14","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"15364431","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7072559/","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2015","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Resource Allocation and EE-SE Trade-Off in Hybrid Cognitive Gaussian Relay Channels","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61201195 and 61201196"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002855","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology of China"},{"fundingName":"863 Project in 5G Wireless Networking","grantNumber":"2014AA012101"},{"fundingName":"EU FP7 QUICK project","grantNumber":"PIRSES-GA-2013-612652"},{"fundingName":"Opening Project of the Key Laboratory of Cognitive Radio and Information Processing (Guilin University of Electronic Technology)"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"2013KF01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Resource Allocation and EE-SE Trade-Off in Hybrid Cognitive Gaussian Relay Channels","sourcePdf":"twc-wang-2417550-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119566S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7182829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7182829","articleId":"7072559","onlineDate":"30 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7072574,"authors":[{"name":"Beibei Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Smart Grid Technology and Equipment, Jiangsu Province, Southeast University, Nanjing, P.R.

Flexiramp is committed capacity reserved to meet unexpected ramps in net load. We evaluate flexiramp market designs by comparing solutions of 1) an ISO real-time market simulation (a deterministic real-time unit commitment (RTUC) model with flexiramp requirements) with 2) a stochastic RTUC model, used as a baseline for evaluating flexiramp solutions. The flexiramp constraint improves the expected performance of ISO real-time markets, but is inefficient compared to stochastic RTUC. Flexiramp markets are inefficient in part because the deterministic model disregards the possibility of higher than anticipated energy production by capacity reserved for ramp. Thus, for instance, capacity with low commitment costs but high running costs might be overcommitted, increasing energy costs under high ramp outcomes. The amount of flexiramp acquired strongly affects costs. Too little results in under-commitment of generators and high price fluctuations and even demand curtailment; too much leads to over-commitment, inflating production costs. Hence, careful design of the ramp market and consideration of the use of full stochastic dispatch and commitment models is recommended.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072574/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7072574/","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2016","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15786969","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Markets for Flexiramp: A Stochastic Unit Commitment-Based Analysis","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":""}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Markets for Flexiramp: A Stochastic Unit Commitment-Based Analysis","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-wang-2411268-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0829S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"7410135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"7410135","articleId":"7072574","onlineDate":"30 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7072588,"authors":[{"name":"Ping Jack Soh","affiliation":["Advanced Communication Engineering (ACE) CoE, Universiti Malaysia Perlis (UniMAP), Arau, Perlis, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Ping Jack","lastName":"Soh","id":"37297301200"},{"name":"Guy A.E.

The combined information obtained from such systems can either be relayed directly to any health-monitoring personnel in the case of emergencies or can be logged and analyzed as a part of preventive health measures. However, the deployment of on-body nodes for humans must be performed with care, as they may interfere with the patients' regular movements. This is especially challenging because the relationship between the electromagnetic waves is influenced by the patient's movements, distance from the nearest base station, operating environment, etc. Additional challenges to the deployment of such mechanisms are also faced in situations where the nodes require additional on-body space, impose additional weight, or are not conformal enough to the patient's body. On the hardware design aspect, the sensory and communication functions on the electronic node have to be designed using special materials to avoid reliability issues or damage due to repeated or intense movements. Finally, and perhaps the most important aspect that needs to be addressed concerning such systems, is their electromagnetic safety level, which is defined by their specific absorption rates (SARs). This article aims to review the latest developments in body-worn wireless health-monitoring systems and their current challenges and limitations and to discuss future trends for such worn devices for these applications.","doi":"10.1109/MMM.2015.2394021","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMM.2015.2394021","startPage":"55","endPage":"70","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/6668/7072576/07072588.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7072576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wearable Wireless Health Monitoring: Current Developments, Challenges, and Future Trends","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072588/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Wearable Wireless Health Monitoring: Current Developments, Challenges, and Future Trends","volume":"16","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","accessionNumber":"15026892","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7072588/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wearable Wireless Health Monitoring: Current Developments, Challenges, and Future Trends","sourcePdf":"16mmm04-soh-2394021-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139413S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6668","isNumber":"7072576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6668","citationCount":"149","xplore-issue":"7072576","articleId":"7072588","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7072597,"authors":[{"name":"Haleh Hosseini","affiliation":["Centre of Excellence for Telecommunication Technology, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor Bahru, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9754/7072586/7072597/hosse-2355916-small.gif","p":["Haleh Hosseini (S\u201908\u2013A\u201914) received the B.Sc. degree in electronic engineering from the Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, Kerman, Iran, the M.Sc. degree in communication systems from the University of Yazd, Yazd, Iran, and the Ph.D. degree from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), Johor Bahru, Malaysia.","She is currently a Post-Doctoral Fellow with UTM.

The availability of channels for secondary users is determined in the spectrum sensing phase by energy detection. Energy levels of sampled primary user's (PU's) signal can be measured by wavelet transform with more accuracy compared with Fourier-based methods. Wavelet packet-based spectrum sensing measures the energy level at each subcarrier and sets the decision threshold. However, at the first step of energy detection for wideband spectrum sensing, high-rate analog-to-digital converter (ADC) sampling requires a large dynamic range and high-speed signal processors. In this paper, compressed sampling for PU's signal acquisition is proposed to reduce the rate of sampling and solve the implementation complexity of ADC. The simulation results verify that this mechanism is promising to estimate the power spectrum density (PSD) of PU's signals. The graphs prove low side-lobes of the detected PSD and acceptable probability of detection and false alarm due to the target values and certain compression ratio.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CJECE.2014.2355916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7072586","startPage":"31","endPage":"36","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/9754/7072586/07072597.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed Wavelet Packet-Based Spectrum Sensing With Adaptive Thresholding for Cognitive Radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072597/","chronOrPublicationDate":"winter  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"winter  2015","htmlLink":"/document/7072597/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Compressed Wavelet Packet-Based Spectrum Sensing With Adaptive Thresholding for Cognitive Radio","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"winter 2015","accessionNumber":"15035732","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"38","issue":"1","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Management Center, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor Bahru, Malaysia","grantNumber":"R.J1300000-7923.4S063"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed Wavelet Packet-Based Spectrum Sensing With Adaptive Thresholding for Cognitive Radio","sourcePdf":"cjece-farzamnia-2355916-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098241S","chronDate":"winter  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9754","isNumber":"7072586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9754","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7072586","articleId":"7072597","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7072605,"authors":[{"name":"Hadi Saghafi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Hadi","lastName":"Saghafi","id":"37296308900"},{"name":"Hamidreza Karshenas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamidreza","lastName":"Karshenas","id":"37270552700"},{"name":"Alireza Bakhshai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen\u2019s University, Kingston, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Bakhshai","id":"37266634300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-8688"}],"articleNumber":"7072605","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":551},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Canada","url":"http://www.ieee.ca/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Oscillators","Decentralized control","Reactive power","Mathematical model","Power system stability","Damping","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","power supply quality","power system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated series compensator","power oscillation damping","standalone microgrids","power quality degradation","converter overloading","converter based grid connected microsource","microsource controller","series voltage","eigenvalue analysis","time-domain simulations"]},{"kwd":["Distributed energy resources","distributed generation (DG)","microgrid (MG)","power oscillation damping","series compensation","small signal stability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7072605","doi":"10.1109/CJECE.2014.2328627","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CJECE.2014.2328627","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7072586","publicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/9754/7072586/07072605.pdf","startPage":"2","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Integrated Series Compensator in Damping Power Oscillations in Standalone Microgrids","abstract":"This paper is concerned with power oscillation damping in standalone microgrids (MGs) using an integrated series compensator. Power oscillation is the result of dynamic interaction between generating units and/or loads in a power system, which results in increased losses, power quality degradation, and momentary overloading of the converters used in converter-based grid-connected microsources (MSs) in MGs. Designing an MS controller to mitigate these oscillations is not straightforward as other performance criteria may need to be compromised. The proposed structure employs a small series compensator to mitigate the oscillations. In this paper, the dependence of power/frequency variation is analytically shown. It is explained how by introduction of a series voltage, this dependence can be minimized. The derivation of the small-signal model used for eigenvalue analysis is briefly explained. To validate the modeling and show the performance and robustness of the proposed controller, time-domain simulations are used. Discussions on the size of the proposed compensator and also on using different control parameters are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072605/","chronOrPublicationDate":"winter  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7072605/","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","publicationDate":"winter 2015","accessionNumber":"15035729","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"38","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Application of Integrated Series Compensator in Damping Power Oscillations in Standalone Microgrids","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Integrated Series Compensator in Damping Power Oscillations in Standalone Microgrids","sourcePdf":"cjece-karshenas-2328627-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066514S","chronDate":"winter  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9754","isNumber":"7072586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9754","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7072586","articleId":"7072605","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7072629,"authors":[{"name":"Gustavo Guarin","affiliation":["Institute for Electronics Engineering, University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Gustavo","lastName":"Guarin","id":"37085441973"},{"name":"Maximilian Hofmann","affiliation":["Institute for Electronics Engineering, University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Maximilian","lastName":"Hofmann","id":"37704225600"},{"name":"Johannes Nehring","affiliation":["Institute for Electronics Engineering, University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Nehring","id":"38547879700"},{"name":"Robert Weigel","affiliation":["Institute for Electronics Engineering, University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Weigel","id":"37085342852"},{"name":"Georg Fischer","affiliation":["Institute for Electronics Engineering, University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Fischer","id":"37288289900"},{"name":"Dietmar Kissinger","affiliation":["IHP, Frankfurt, Oder, Germany"],"firstName":"Dietmar","lastName":"Kissinger","id":"37400279800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1527-3342"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9581"}],"articleNumber":"7072629","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1655},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://mtt.org/index.html"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Miniature Microwave Biosensors: Noninvasive Applications","abstract":"Demographic shifts are part of the process of social and economic change that has been taking place worldwide over the last century.

In addition, the increase of chronic diseases correlated with the lifestyle and the behavior in industrial countries (e.g., tobacco consumption, obesity, and the fact that the need for the primary care increases while the number of primary care providers diminishes) represent the challenges to be solved for the health systems of modern society [4].","pdfPath":"/iel7/6668/7072576/07072629.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"86","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7072576","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMM.2015.2394024","doi":"10.1109/MMM.2015.2394024","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7072629","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensor phenomena and characterization","Biosensors","Social factors","Economics","Senior citizens","Frequency measurement","Statistics","Population","Medical services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical equipment","biosensors","chemical sensors","diseases","geriatrics","health care","microwave devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["miniature microwave biosensors","elderly people","social security systems","pensions","health care","chronic diseases","tobacco consumption","obesity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072629/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Miniature Microwave Biosensors: Noninvasive Applications","accessionNumber":"15026894","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7072629/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Miniature Microwave Biosensors: Noninvasive Applications","sourcePdf":"16mmm04-guarin-2394024-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.216311S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6668","isNumber":"7072576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6668","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"7072576","articleId":"7072629","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7072682,"authors":[{"name":"P.W.C.

The two dimensional (2-D) code provides high spectral density and large number of subscribers. In this paper a literature review on noncoherent 2-D code families of OCDMA system is presented. The 2-D code is constructed by spreading the optical pulses in two dimensions. Generally, three popular schemes of 2-D OCDMA: spectral/time, spectral/spatial and time/spatial schemes. The most popular schemes are spectral/time and spectral/spatial. In the spectral/time, a different wavelengths are spread in different time slots. While the wavelengths are spread into many optical fibers in spectral/spatial scheme. Each scheme has a merits and demerits so that a tradeoff must be made to choose the suitable scheme for a specific application.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSCE.2014.7072695","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Control System, Computing and Engineering (ICCSCE 2014)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Control System, Computing and Engineering (ICCSCE 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7063839/7072673/07072695.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSCE.2014.7072695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7072673","startPage":"90","endPage":"94","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Review on two dimensional code of noncoherent OCDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7072695","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Review on two dimensional code of noncoherent OCDMA systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Nov. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072695/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Nov. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"15025885","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7072695/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Review on two dimensional code of noncoherent OCDMA systems","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"0017ID45.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054575S","chronDate":"28-30 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7063839","isNumber":"7072673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7063839","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7072673","articleId":"7072695","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7072706,"authors":[{"name":"Saiful I.

To improve the accuracy of damping ratio estimation and make it benefit for engineering application has been a difficult problem. A new method for the estimation of damping ratio which is necessary for structure dynamics analysis is presented. Under-damped free vibration response and damped exponential signals have the same expression. At first, the frequency spectrum of a damped exponential signal is obtained by Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT); then the damping factor and frequency deviation are calculated by frequency domain interpolation, which employ the ratio of two neighboring spectral samples. The damping ratio is easily determined from the definite relationship between the damping ratio and damping factor. Experiment shows the good accuracy, compared with traditional methods, proving the reliability of the proposed method in engineering application. Thus, this frequency domain interpolation method provides an alternative way for damping ratio estimation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072725/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Nov. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Nov. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/7072725/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"15025991","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A frequency domain interpolation method for damping ratio estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A frequency domain interpolation method for damping ratio estimation","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"0047ID96.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05869S","chronDate":"28-30 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7063839","isNumber":"7072673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7063839","xplore-issue":"7072673","articleId":"7072725","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7072732,"authors":[{"name":"Nur Atiqah Adon","affiliation":["Cardiology and Physiome Analysis Research Laboratory"],"firstName":"Nur Atiqah","lastName":"Adon","id":"37085543912"},{"name":"Farhanahani Mahmud","affiliation":["Cardiology and Physiome Analysis Research Laboratory"],"firstName":"Farhanahani","lastName":"Mahmud","id":"38635925900"},{"name":"Mohamad Hairol Jabbar","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM), Batu Pahat, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohamad Hairol","lastName":"Jabbar","id":"38468908500"},{"name":"Norliza Othman","affiliation":["Cardiology and Physiome Analysis Research Laboratory"],"firstName":"Norliza","lastName":"Othman","id":"37085533615"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5686-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5685-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7072732","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Computational modeling","Hardware design languages","Field programmable gate arrays","Software packages","Hardware","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric potentials","cardiology","cellular biophysics","equivalent circuits","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","medical computing","medical disorders","very high speed integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-in-the-loop cosimulation","reentrant arrhythmia mechanism","cardiac cells","active circuits","one dimensional ring-shaped model","FitzHugh-Nagumo model","FHN","1D ring-shaped cable model","Simulink","action potential signal","hardware design","HDL Coder","Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language code generation","VHSIC","VHDL design","Field Programmable Gate Array Xilinx Virtex-6 board","HDL Verifier","target FPGA device","cardiac reentrant excitation-conduction","FPGA-based hardware implementation","stand-alone implementation","complex real-time simulation","manual HDL designs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reentrant","FitzHugh-Nagumo Model","HDL Coder","FPGA-in-the-Loop","real-time simulations"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the simulation of reentrant excitation-conduction of cardiac cells realized by coupling 80 active circuits in one dimensional (1D) ring-shaped based on FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model. 1D ring-shaped cable model is designed using Simulink in order to simulate an action potential signal and its conduction for a hardware design by using HDL Coder to automate the model for Very High Speed Integrated Circuit (VHSIC) Hardware Description Language (VHDL) code generation.

Selecting a uniform sampling rate for a control loop is robust, but pessimistic for sharing processors among multiple control loops. Fine-grained regulation of periodicity achieves better resource utilization, but is hard to implement online in a robust way. However, an offline control theoretic analysis of the system illustrates the benefits of proper period selection for different modes. Such analysis reveals the necessity to automatically derive a multi-mode scheduler and converge on suitable periods for each mode. This paper proposes a methodology to automatically generate such a scheduler for an embedded real-time control system leveraging its design attributes. The proposed method provides significant gains in computational efficiency without trading off the performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSCE.2014.7072733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSCE.2014.7072733","startPage":"294","endPage":"299","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Control System, Computing and Engineering (ICCSCE 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7063839/7072673/07072733.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Control System, Computing and Engineering (ICCSCE 2014)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7072673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis of sampling modes for adaptive control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of sampling modes for adaptive control","conferenceDate":"28-30 Nov. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7072733/","accessionNumber":"15025895","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072733/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of sampling modes for adaptive control","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"0055ID115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060515S","chronDate":"28-30 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7063839","isNumber":"7072673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7063839","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7072673","articleId":"7072733","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7072771,"authors":[{"name":"Norliza Othman","affiliation":["UTHM, Microelectronics and Nanotechnology-Shamsuddin Research Centre (MiNT-SRC), Batu Pahat, Johor","Faculty of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM), Batu Pahat, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Norliza","lastName":"Othman","id":"37085533615"},{"name":"Farhanahani Mahmud","affiliation":["UTHM, Microelectronics and Nanotechnology-Shamsuddin Research Centre (MiNT-SRC), Batu Pahat, Johor","Faculty of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM), Batu Pahat, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Farhanahani","lastName":"Mahmud","id":"38635925900"},{"name":"Abd Kadir Mahamad","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM), Batu Pahat, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Abd Kadir","lastName":"Mahamad","id":"37543122200"},{"name":"M.

This optimization is very crucial to achieve the best performance in terms of speed, area and power consumption of the generated HDL code before deploying the field programmable gate array (FPGA) stand-alone implementation. As computational mathematical modeling needs immense amounts of simulation time, FPGA could bring the solutions as it provides high performance, and able to perform real-time simulations and compute in parallel mode operation. In this study, in order to ease verification, prototyping, and implementation FPGA, rapid prototyping model-based design approach of HDL Coder from MathWorks has been used to automate HDL codes generation from a designed MATLAB Simulink blocks of Luo-Rudy Phase I (LR-I) model towards FPGA hardware-implemented for numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) responsible in generating the action potential (AP) waveform of mammalian cardiac ventricle cell. By using HDL Coder, the model is successfully converted into an optimal fixed-point VHDL design and the operating frequency is increased from 9.819 MHz to 23. 613MHz by pipelining optimization.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSCE.2014.7072771","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSCE.2014.7072771","startPage":"507","endPage":"511","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Control System, Computing and Engineering (ICCSCE 2014)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Control System, Computing and Engineering (ICCSCE 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7063839/7072673/07072771.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7072673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cardiac excitation modeling: HDL coder optimization towards FPGA stand-alone implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072771/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Nov. 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Cardiac excitation modeling: HDL coder optimization towards FPGA stand-alone implementation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","accessionNumber":"15025985","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/7072771/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cardiac excitation modeling: HDL coder optimization towards FPGA stand-alone implementation","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"0093ID199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069002S","chronDate":"28-30 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7063839","isNumber":"7072673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7063839","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7072673","articleId":"7072771","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7072791,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed.

By nature, the existence of femtocell can lead to the increase of handover initiation. However, 3GPP standard provides Mobility Robustness Optimization (MRO) to optimize handover performance. MRO is a use-case for Self-Organizing Network (SON). The conventional MRO algorithm tunes handover parameters based on counts of handover failures and handover events. In addition, conventional MRO algorithm uses hysteresis only to adjust and improve HO performance. In this paper, we propose an improved MRO algorithm by taking into account new optimization parameters, which is Time To Trigger parameter (TTT) to improve MRO algorithm performance in terms of reducing Ping-Pong rate and lower HO failure rate between femtocell and macrocell. We compared our improved MRO algorithm with the conventional one. The simulation results show remarkable improvement of the improved MRO algorithm over the standard one.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSCE.2014.7072796","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Control System, Computing and Engineering (ICCSCE 2014)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Control System, Computing and Engineering (ICCSCE 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7063839/7072673/07072796.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSCE.2014.7072796","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7072673","startPage":"636","endPage":"640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameters optimization for handover between femtocell and macrocell in LTE-based network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7072796","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Parameters optimization for handover between femtocell and macrocell in LTE-based network","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Nov. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072796/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Nov. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"15025875","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7072796/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameters optimization for handover between femtocell and macrocell in LTE-based network","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"0118ID250.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120694S","chronDate":"28-30 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7063839","isNumber":"7072673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7063839","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7072673","articleId":"7072796","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7072812,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Pienta","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Pienta","id":"37085444131"},{"name":"James Abello","affiliation":["Rutgers University"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Abello"},{"name":"Minsuk Kahng","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Minsuk","lastName":"Kahng","id":"37085451248"},{"name":"Duen Horng Chau","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Duen Horng","lastName":"Chau","id":"38276339400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7303-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2375-933X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-9356"}],"articleNumber":"7072812","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":786},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable graph exploration and visualization: Sensemaking challenges and opportunities","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Visualization","Data mining","Scalability","Pattern matching","Machine learning algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","graph theory","mathematics computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable graph exploration approach","scalable graph visualization approach","graph datasets","graph handling","data mining","machine learning","human-computer ineraction","information visualization","information retrieval","recommender systems","graph sensemaking hierarchy"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7072812","abstract":"Making sense of large graph datasets is a fundamental and challenging process that advances science, education and technology.

The language expert knowledge is also necessary to build those rules and matching patterns. To avoid high annotation cost, example-based dialogue management is adopted for building chat-oriented dialogue system. We also propose three features: POS-tagged tokens for sentence matching, using NE types and values for searching proper responses, and using back-off responses for unmatched user utterances. Also, our system automatically collects user-related facts from user input sentences and stores the facts into a long-term memory. System responses can be modified by applying user-related facts in the long-term memory. A relevance score of a system response is proposed to select responses that include user-related fact, or frequently used responses. In several experiments, we have found that our proposed features contribute to improve the performance and our system shows competitive performance to ALICE system with the same training corpus.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072837/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Feb. 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Feb. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7072837/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"15025571","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Example-based chat-oriented dialogue system with personalized long-term memory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Example-based chat-oriented dialogue system with personalized long-term memory","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"RS82.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042075S","chronDate":"9-11 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7062153","isNumber":"7072806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7062153","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7072806","articleId":"7072837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7072880,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Wang","affiliation":["College of Business and Information System, Dakota State University, Madison, SD"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Wang","id":"38541588400"},{"name":"Yazan Alshboul","affiliation":["College of Business and Information System, Dakota State University, Madison, SD"],"firstName":"Yazan","lastName":"Alshboul","id":"37085417407"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7428-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7072880","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1255},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile security testing approaches and challenges","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7072880","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Testing","Malware","Smart phones","Forensics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital forensics","mobile computing","program diagnostics","program testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile forensic","penetration test","static analysis","dynamic analysis","mobile security testing network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile security","testing approaches","challenges"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MOBISECSERV.2015.7072880","publicationTitle":"2015 First Conference on Mobile and Secure Services (MOBISECSERV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 First Conference on Mobile and Secure Services (MOBISECSERV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7058960/7072857/07072880.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MOBISECSERV.2015.7072880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7072857","abstract":"Mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are widely used for personal and business purposes. A mobile device may carry sensitive data and becomes an easy target for cyber criminals. Mobile security is thus important. Mobile security testing targets to detect vulnerabilities and malicious apps on a mobile device. In this paper, we present four testing approaches for mobile security: mobile forensic, penetration test, static analysis, and dynamic analysis. A mobile security testing network is further demonstrated in the paper to evaluate the effectiveness of the four testing approaches. Our testing results indicate that mobile security testing tools are still in their early development stages and efforts are desired to improve these tools.

Five methods are evaluated which are based on network topology, differential equation, non-linear continuous frequency model, linearized low frequency models, and linearized discrete time model. Evaluation of criteria are: domains of application, accuracy and economics. Particular emphasis is given to a non-linear continuous time model derived from the state variable representation. Taking the average of state vector over one period leads to a large signal and small signal models with separate set of equations for buck boost regulators in heave and light conduction modes. Frequency domain transformation follows naturally involving duty ratio and input voltage.

As the system becomes more complex with the reduction of transistor size, fault detection and correction schemes are not limited to data transfer process. Internal components of the system's processor are also susceptible to soft errors that potentially would halt the system operation. This paper is focused on the current implementation of error correction code (ECC) on internal processor architecture. Various ECC algorithms are discussed from theory to its operation. Several researches that implemented ECC in processor architecture are also presented in order to demonstrate the variety of ECC execution to the processor architecture. A custom soft-core processor called UTEMRISC is presented as a study case to execute an ECC algorithm in low-end soft-core processor architecture on FPGA platform. For future work, the FT design will be embedded in UTeMRISC03 processor with further analysis of the fault assessment on each of the processor's components.","doi":"10.1109/SCORED.2014.7072971","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Student Conference on Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Student Conference on Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel7/7063710/7072937/07072971.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCORED.2014.7072971","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7072937","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7072971","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A survey of fault-tolerant processor based on error correction code","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 Dec. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7072971/","displayDocTitle":"A survey of fault-tolerant processor based on error correction code","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7072971/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"16-17 Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15025711","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A survey of fault-tolerant processor based on error correction code","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"03311570025245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073714S","chronDate":"16-17 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7063710","isNumber":"7072937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7063710","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7072937","articleId":"7072971","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7072983,"authors":[{"name":"Dalia M.

The inter-area oscillation is one of the phenomena that adversely affect power transmission through weak tie-lines. Since the wind power plants are connected in remote grid areas, they can effectively contribute to damp these low-frequency oscillations.

However, emotions play a significant role in online communication. Automatic extraction of emotions from the text is a hot research issue because it minimizes the communication gap and misunderstanding between users. To become emotionally more intelligent, our previous text to emotion analyzing system should communicate with experts for suggestions of possible emotional state if it fails to analyze the text. In this research, we augment our previous system by introducing active learning approach which allows to query experts for emotional label of the given text. It makes our training dataset enriched. To build a classification model by analyzing the training dataset, we employ Naive Bayes classification technique. Our classifier updates the emotional database automatically. We also develop a prototype of our system named TEA: Text-to-Emotion-Analyzer. Our experiment and evaluation section exhibits satisfactory results in terms of recall-precision over our previous system as well as other method namely Vector Space Model (VSM).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073079/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15025730","htmlLink":"/document/7073079/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-23 Dec. 2014","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Introducing active learning on Text to Emotion Analyzer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Introducing active learning on Text to Emotion Analyzer","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105593S","chronDate":"22-23 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7063711","isNumber":"7073056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7063711","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7073056","articleId":"7073079","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7073080,"authors":[{"name":"Tahsina Hashem","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Jahangirnagar University, Savar, Dhaka"],"firstName":"Tahsina","lastName":"Hashem","id":"37085505478"},{"name":"Md.

This research presents a detailed analysis of capacity performance of MIMO systems under four fading cases i.e. Gaussian, Weibull, Rayleigh and Nakagami-m fading in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. We first derive analytical expressions for the expectation of the trace of the complex channel matrix. Then we measure the low-SNR performance of MIMO system under four fading conditions with respect to minimum normalized energy per information bit and wideband slope. Also a comparative analysis has been performed between the channel capacity of spatial-multiplexing (SM) MIMO and Orthogonal Space Time block coded (OSTBC) MIMO system. Simulation results show that performance of the system depends on different criteria of MIMO fading channels. According to the capacity performance of MIMO system, four fading channels can be ordered as Gaussian, Nakagami-m, Rayleigh and Weibull fading channels respectively.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Rayleigh channels","Channel capacity","Signal to noise ratio","Shape","Weibull fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","channel coding","Gaussian channels","MIMO communication","Nakagami channels","orthogonal codes","radio links","Rayleigh channels","space division multiplexing","space-time block codes","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO link performance analysis","SM multiple input multiple output system reliability","fading channel capacity improvement","low signal-to-noise ratio","complex channel matrix","low SNR performance","spatial multiplexing MIMO system","orthogonal space time block coded MIMO system","OSTBC MIMO system","Gaussian fading channel","Nakagami-m fading channel","Rayleigh fading channel","Weibull fading channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple Input Multiple Output","Fading","low-SNR","OSTBC"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7073056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCITechn.2014.7073080","startPage":"498","endPage":"503","publicationTitle":"2014 17th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 17th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7063711/7073056/07073080.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICCITechn.2014.7073080","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of MIMO link under fading channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of MIMO link under fading channels","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15025741","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-23 Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7073080/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073080/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Dec. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of MIMO link under fading channels","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057671S","chronDate":"22-23 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7063711","isNumber":"7073056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7063711","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7073056","articleId":"7073080","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":7073089,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We consider two models namely conventional co-located MIMO (C-MIMO) and distributed MIMO (D-MIMO) models. At first, we derive the achievable rate for the C-MIMO and D-MIMO systems. Secondly, we use maximum ratio combining (MRC), zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) detectors in the receiver and derive the expression of achievable rate for both the C-MIMO and D-MIMO systems. Finally, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the ergodic capacity when the number of antennas at one or both sides goes to infinity. Our investigation concludes that the ergodic capacity of both the co-located and distributed MIMO channels is intuitive as the increasing number of antennas helps to eliminate the effect of fading. MMSE detector shows significant performance in enhancing the ergodic capacity of Nakagami-m fading channels compared to ZF and MRC detectors.","doi":"10.1109/ICCITechn.2014.7073089","publicationTitle":"2014 17th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 17th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7063711/7073056/07073089.pdf","startPage":"510","endPage":"513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCITechn.2014.7073089","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7073056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of Nakagami-m fading massive MIMO channels with linear receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073089","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Dec. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073089/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of Nakagami-m fading massive MIMO channels with linear receivers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15025781","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7073089/","conferenceDate":"22-23 Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of Nakagami-m fading massive MIMO channels with linear receivers","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.160022S","chronDate":"22-23 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7063711","isNumber":"7073056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7063711","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7073056","articleId":"7073089","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7073105,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

An optimization framework is developed to maximize the aggregate utility and to compute the optimal scheduling parameters in a single cell cellular network. The optimization problem is a very complex non linear program (NLP). The problem is solved numerically for several medium size network scenarios using an optimization tool. The numerical results show that MU-MIMO technique provides a significant utility gain over single user MIMO (SU-MIMO) technique. Further, the optimal scheduling parameters are determined analytically for the both SU-MIMO and MU-MIMO schemes. Interestingly, the optimal scheduling is found to be the same as the round-robin scheduling for the both MIMO schemes which is also validated by numerical computation. In this work, it is demonstrated that the simple round robin scheduling can achieve the proportional fairness in a SU-MIMO as well as a MU-MIMO uplink cellular network.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 17th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology

novel node mobility(NoM) approach of cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) communication in beyond 4g spectrum management (SM)","abstract":"The amount of signaling needed to maintain the CRNs topology has been estimated with regard to different radius of clusters size management scenarios. The node mobility for the recommended network model has been simulated according to a Random Waypoint mobility model (RWP). The simulation results show that only a portion of the network hosts simultaneously traverse their respective cluster boundaries. Additionally, this amount is heavily impacted by the cluster sizes, which must be properly dimensioned based on factors like, local, geographical or regulatory considerations. The sides (vertices) of a large cluster become longer, which further increases the probability of nodes traversing them. Consequently, this signifies the need for a more flexible and dynamic allocation of the spectrum resources, which requires a new approach to cognitive radio network management. This can be achieved with the help of mobile devices capable of accurately sensing the spectrum occupancy, learning about temporarily unused frequency bands and able to reconfigure their transmission parameters in such a way that the spectral opportunities can be effectively exploited.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Dec. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073110/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15025798","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","conferenceDate":"22-23 Dec. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7073110/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel node mobility(NoM) approach of cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) communication in beyond 4g spectrum management (SM)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel node mobility(NoM) approach of cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) communication in beyond 4g spectrum management (SM)","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075133S","chronDate":"22-23 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7063711","isNumber":"7073056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7063711","xplore-issue":"7073056","articleId":"7073110","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7073118,"authors":[{"name":"Tangina Sultana","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Technology (IICT), Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Tangina","lastName":"Sultana","id":"37085420046"},{"name":"Shamim Ara Shawkat","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Technology (IICT), Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Shamim Ara","lastName":"Shawkat","id":"37085390127"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6288-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6287-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7073118","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":203},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Correlation","Pulse shaping methods","Narrowband","Broadband communication","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","error statistics","fast Fourier transforms","inverse transforms","OFDM modulation","pulse shaping","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulse shaping technique","PAPR reduction","OFDM system","transmitter","transceiver","square root raised cosine pulse","cross correlation function","IFFT","bit error rate","BER","FFT"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","PAPR","Sine","Kaiser window","Tukey window","Raised cosine","Square root raised cosine"]}],"abstract":"This paper aims at contributing to find out the best pulse shaping technique to reduce peak to average power ratio (PAPR) for OFDM system efficiently. At first different narrowband pulses (Sine, Tukey window and Kaiser window) as well as broadband pulses (Raised cosine and Square root raised cosine pulse) have been employed in the transmitter section. In order to carry out the performance analysis, a mathematical model is derived for each of the above employed pulse shaping techniques which includes equations for PAPR and cross correlation. The proposed technique needs only one IFFT/FFT in the transceiver and does not require any side information. Based on this model, a performance comparison is carried out between all the mentioned narrowband and broadband pulses. Numerical result shows that the square root raised cosine pulse reduces the PAPR more significantly than any other pulse and the existing system as well. Furthermore cross correlation function is also examined for both narrowband and broadband pulses. Finally in order to show the efficacy of the proposed efficient pulse shaping technique (Square root raised cosine pulse), bit error rate (BER) is calculated and compared with the conventional system. Simulation result shows that the proposed scheme can reduce the BER more effectively than the conventional system. Therefore, square root raised cosine pulse can be used not only to reduce the PAPR of OFDM system effectively but also to improve the BER performance of the system.","doi":"10.1109/ICCITechn.2014.7073118","publicationTitle":"2014 17th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 17th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7063711/7073056/07073118.pdf","startPage":"482","endPage":"487","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCITechn.2014.7073118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7073056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Employment of pulse shaping techniques for efficient PAPR reduction in OFDM system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073118","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Dec. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073118/","displayDocTitle":"Employment of pulse shaping techniques for efficient PAPR reduction in OFDM system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15025775","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7073118/","conferenceDate":"22-23 Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Employment of pulse shaping techniques for efficient PAPR reduction in OFDM system","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050093S","chronDate":"22-23 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7063711","isNumber":"7073056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7063711","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7073056","articleId":"7073118","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7073120,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

This paper proposes a new, efficient hardware design methodology for implementing double precision floating point addition and subtraction. The pipeline hardware design is implemented on Virtex-6 and Virtex-5 Xilinx FPGA. As per the synthesis result, the maximum operating frequency achieved for the proposed hardware design for clock latency of 8 cycles is significantly higher than the previous hardware designs.

Denoising of noisy signal has great clinical importance for the diagnosis of cardiac abnormalities. In this paper, dual tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) has been used to denoise noisy ECG signals. DTCWT generates complex coefficient to obtain their real and imaginary part by using wavelet filters of dual tree. Noisy ECG signal has been simulated applying five different noise models to ECG records of MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. The calculated SNR and MSE after denoising using DTCWT showed better performance for all types of noise than the discrete wavelet transforms (DWT). Dual tree complex wavelet transforms has performed significantly for composite of different noises.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Denoising of ECG signals using dual tree complex wavelet transform","publicationTitle":"2014 17th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT)","doi":"10.1109/ICCITechn.2014.7073141","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 17th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7063711/7073056/07073141.pdf","startPage":"379","endPage":"382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCITechn.2014.7073141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7073056","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073141","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073141/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Dec. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Denoising of ECG signals using dual tree complex wavelet transform","conferenceDate":"22-23 Dec. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7073141/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15025796","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Denoising of ECG signals using dual tree complex wavelet transform","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074205S","chronDate":"22-23 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7063711","isNumber":"7073056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7063711","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7073056","articleId":"7073141","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7073149,"authors":[{"name":"Md Fazlul Kader","affiliation":["University of Chittagong, Chittagong, BD"],"firstName":"Md Fazlul","lastName":"Kader"},{"name":"Asaduzzaman","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, Chittagong University of Engg. & Tech., Bangladesh"],"lastName":"Asaduzzaman"},{"name":"Soo Young Shin","affiliation":["Kumoh National Institute of Technology, Gumi, Gyeongsangbuk-do, KR"],"firstName":"Soo Young","lastName":"Shin"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6288-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6287-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7073149","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Interference","Capacity planning","Radio transmitters","Closed-form solutions","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","fading channels","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outage capacity analysis","secondary network in interference","cognitive radio spectrum sharing system","primary transmitter-receiver pair","multiple secondary transmitter-receiver pairs","fading channel","primary user activity","relaying link"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["outage capacity","cognitive radio","secondary network","spectrum sharing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073149","doi":"10.1109/ICCITechn.2014.7073149","publicationTitle":"2014 17th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT)","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the outage capacity of a secondary network in a cognitive radio (CR) cooperative spectrum sharing system consisting of a primary transmitter (PTx)-receiver (PRx) pair as well as multiple secondary transmitter (STx)-receiver (SRx) pairs.

In this paper, we present a framework for a rule based anomaly detection of Building Automation and Control networks. We develop an anomaly based intrusion detection system to the building network by training the system with dataflows that are dynamically captured from the Fire Alarm System testbed using the BACnet Protocol Monitoring module. The rules acquired from the offline data mining procedure can detect attacks against the BACnet protocol with an extremely low false positive rate. We evaluate our approach by launching several attacks that exploit the generic vulnerabilities of the BACnet Protocol. A classification of detected attacks is introduced at the end.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE/ACS 11th International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7066213/7073167/07073181.pdf","startPage":"72","endPage":"77","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE/ACS 11th International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA)","doi":"10.1109/AICCSA.2014.7073181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICCSA.2014.7073181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7073167","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly based intrusion detection for Building Automation and Control networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Protocols","Security","Feature extraction","Buildings","IP networks","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","data mining","Internet","IP networks","knowledge based systems","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","BACnet protocol monitoring module","fire alarm system","rule based anomaly detection","public network","Internet","building automation and control network","anomaly based intrusion detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data mining","anomaly detection","SCADA","BACnet"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073181/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly based intrusion detection for Building Automation and Control networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7073181/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"15026341","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly based intrusion detection for Building Automation and Control networks","confLoc":"Doha, Qatar","sourcePdf":"0014aiccsa2014submission40.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054703S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7066213","isNumber":"7073167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7066213","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7073167","articleId":"7073181","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":7073245,"authors":[{"name":"Khalil M.

This combination of SC and QGA leads to a better retrieval results based on our tests. The SC is a very powerful discriminative descriptor which is translation and scale invariant, but weak against rotation and flipping. In our proposed quantum shape context algorithm (QSC), we use the QGA to estimate the best orientation of the target shape to ensure the best matching for rotated and flipped shapes.

Femtocells inherits security and privacy threats of GSM, and UMTS networks such as location privacy and tracking. These threats are even more severe, since the deployment of femtocells, which covers areas as small as an office, allows for an unprecedented tracking of mobile users location. This paper presents an authentication scheme, which allows a mobile user to use an open femtocell, while making it hard for its mobile operator to know the exact location of that mobile user. The scheme complements the privacy protection of UMTS. Further, the scheme enables mobile operators to reward owners of open femtocells. The paper discusses the security of the presented scheme. The simulation of the authentication scheme shows the feasibility of our work.","doi":"10.1109/AICCSA.2014.7073261","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE/ACS 11th International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE/ACS 11th International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7066213/7073167/07073261.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICCSA.2014.7073261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7073167","startPage":"652","endPage":"657","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An authentication scheme to protect the location privacy of femtocell users","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073261","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An authentication scheme to protect the location privacy of femtocell users","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073261/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"15026331","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7073261/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An authentication scheme to protect the location privacy of femtocell users","confLoc":"Doha, Qatar","sourcePdf":"0094aiccsa2014submission229.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090116S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7066213","isNumber":"7073167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7066213","xplore-issue":"7073167","articleId":"7073261","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7073265,"authors":[{"name":"Ramzi Guesmi","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electronics and Information Technology, National Engineering School of Sfax, Sfax University, Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Ramzi","lastName":"Guesmi","id":"37085529558"},{"name":"Mohamed Amine Ben Farah","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electronics and Information Technology, National Engineering School of Sfax, Universite de Sfax, Sfax, TN"],"firstName":"Mohamed Amine","lastName":"Ben Farah","id":"37847744800"},{"name":"Abdennaceur Kachouri","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electronics and Information Technology, National Engineering School of Sfax, Sfax University, Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Abdennaceur","lastName":"Kachouri","id":"37390104600"},{"name":"Mounir Samet","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electronics and Information Technology, National Engineering School of Sfax, Sfax University, Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mounir","lastName":"Samet","id":"37400471400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7100-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-5330"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-5322"}],"articleNumber":"7073265","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073265","abstract":"In this manuscript we present a novel method to design strong substitution Boxes based on chaos function and genetic algorithm techniques.

Numerical simulation and security analysis demonstrate that the scheme is practical in image encryption.","doi":"10.1109/AICCSA.2014.7073265","startPage":"678","endPage":"684","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE/ACS 11th International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7066213/7073167/07073265.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE/ACS 11th International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICCSA.2014.7073265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7073167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel design of Chaos based S-Boxes using genetic algorithm techniques","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Genetic algorithms","Cryptography","Algorithm design and analysis","Sociology","Statistics","Logistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos based S-boxes","genetic algorithm","substitution boxes","chaos function","bijective property","nonlinearity","strict avalanche criterion","output bits independence criterion","equiprobable input-output XOR distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["S-Box","Chaos","Cryptography","Nonlinearity","Genetic algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073265/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A novel design of Chaos based S-Boxes using genetic algorithm techniques","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7073265/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"15026356","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel design of Chaos based S-Boxes using genetic algorithm techniques","confLoc":"Doha, Qatar","sourcePdf":"0098aiccsa2014submission234a.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124242S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7066213","isNumber":"7073167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7066213","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7073167","articleId":"7073265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":7073266,"authors":[{"name":"Amine Ait Si Ali","affiliation":["Qatar University, Doha, Ad Dawhah, QA"],"firstName":"Amine Ait Si","lastName":"Ali"},{"name":"Marek Siupik","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computing, University of the West of Scotland, Paisley, Scotland"],"firstName":"Marek","lastName":"Siupik","id":"37085469211"},{"name":"Abbes Amira","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computing, University of the West of Scotland, Paisley, Scotland","College of Engineering, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Abbes","lastName":"Amira","id":"37085375765"},{"name":"Faycal Bensaali","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Faycal","lastName":"Bensaali","id":"37265538600"},{"name":"Pablo Casaseca-de-la-Higuera","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computing, University of the West of Scotland, Paisley, Scotland"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Casaseca-de-la-Higuera","id":"38271237500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7100-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-5330"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-5322"}],"articleNumber":"7073266","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":542},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Principal component analysis","Hardware","Acceleration","Discrete wavelet transforms","Training","System-on-chip","Decision trees"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["assisted living","discrete wavelet transforms","feature extraction","geriatrics","high level synthesis","principal component analysis","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Vivado HLS tool","RTL implementation","register transfer level implementation","Vivado high level synthesis tool","programmable logic","Zynq system-on-chip","binary DT","binary decision tree","feature extraction","dimensionality reduction","PCA","principal component analysis","Shimmer platform","DWT","discrete wavelet transform","Shimmer wearable sensor","healthcare industry","real-time response system","FDS","elderly people","healthcare systems","fall detection system","Zynq SoC","HLS based hardware acceleration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["decision tree classifier","fall detection system","high level synthesis","principal component analysis","shimmer platform"]}],"abstract":"Fall detection is a major problem in healthcare systems, especially for elderly people who are the most vulnerable. It is important to design and implement not only an accurate fall detection system (FDS) but also a system with a real-time response. The achievement of high accuracy and fast response time together allows the development of a system that helps saving lives, time and money in healthcare industry. This paper presents the design, simulation and implementation of a novel FDS using the Shimmer wearable sensor. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is applied for preprocessing the data coming from the Shimmer platform, principal component analysis (PCA) is used for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction and finally, a binary decision tree (DT) is utilized for classification purpose. The system is simulated in MATLAB prior to the implementation on the Zynq system-on-chip (SoC) for hardware acceleration. DWT is executed on the processing system (PS) of the Zynq platform in a software manner while PCA and DT are both implemented on the programmable logic (PL) for hardware acceleration. PCA and DT are developed in C and synthesized in Vivado high level synthesis (HLS) tool to transform the C based designed into a register transfer level (RTL) implementation. Various optimization techniques are explored in Vivado HLS. The performance of the FDS in terms of accuracy of the classifier is 88.4% while the overall resources used in PL of the Zynq vary between 2% and 23% depending on the running frequency and optimization technique used.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HLS based hardware acceleration on the zynq SoC: A case study for fall detection system","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE/ACS 11th International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA)","doi":"10.1109/AICCSA.2014.7073266","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE/ACS 11th International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7066213/7073167/07073266.pdf","startPage":"685","endPage":"690","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICCSA.2014.7073266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7073167","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073266","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073266/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"HLS based hardware acceleration on the zynq SoC: A case study for fall detection system","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7073266/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"15026359","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HLS based hardware acceleration on the zynq SoC: A case study for fall detection system","confLoc":"Doha, Qatar","sourcePdf":"0099aiccsa2014submission235.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069551S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7066213","isNumber":"7073167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7066213","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7073167","articleId":"7073266","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7073271,"authors":[{"name":"Hanen Karamti","affiliation":["MIRACL Laboratory, University of Sfax, Sfax, TUNISIA"],"firstName":"Hanen","lastName":"Karamti","id":"37085400249"},{"name":"Mohamed Tmar","affiliation":["MIRACL Laboratory, University of Sfax, Sfax, TUNISIA"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Tmar","id":"38053426100"},{"name":"Faiez Gargouri","affiliation":["MIRACL Laboratory, University of Sfax, Sfax, TUNISIA"],"firstName":"Faiez","lastName":"Gargouri","id":"37401853100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7100-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-5330"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-5322"}],"articleNumber":"7073271","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Image retrieval","Neural networks","Feature extraction","Image color analysis","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-based retrieval","image retrieval","neural nets","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-based image retrieval system","neural network","visual information retrieval","vector representation","vector space model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073271","abstract":"Visual information retrieval has become a major research area due to increasing rate at which images are generated in many application.

Experimental results show that, compared with the commonly used matrixes, the proposed matrix has lower reconstruction error under the same reconstruction algorithm and compression ratio.

The imaging equipment is the device, which is used for better image processing and highlighting the important features. These images are affected with random noise during acquisition, analyzing and transmission process. This results in blurry image visible in low contrast. The Image De-noising System (IDs) is used as a tool for removing image noise and preserving important data. Image de-noising is one of the most interesting research areas among researchers of technology-giants and academic institutions. For Criminal Identification Systems (CIS) & Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), IDs is more beneficial in the field of medical imaging. This paper proposes algorithm for de-noising medical images using different types of wavelet transform, such as Haar, Daubechies, Symlets and Biorthogonal. In this paper noise image quality has been evaluated using filter assessment parameters like Variance, Mean Square Error (MSE) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR). It has been observed form the numerical results that, the performance of proposed algorithm reduced the mean square error and achieved best value of peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR). In this paper, the wavelet based de-noising algorithm has been investigated on medical images along with threshold.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Medical image De-noising schemes using wavelet transform with fixed form thresholding","publicationTitle":"2014 11th International Computer Conference on Wavelet Actiev Media Technology and Information Processing(ICCWAMTIP)","doi":"10.1109/ICCWAMTIP.2014.7073435","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 11th International Computer Conference on Wavelet Actiev Media Technology and Information Processing(ICCWAMTIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7063853/7073349/07073435.pdf","startPage":"397","endPage":"402","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCWAMTIP.2014.7073435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7073349","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073435","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073435/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Dec. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Medical image De-noising schemes using wavelet transform with fixed form thresholding","conferenceDate":"19-21 Dec. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7073435/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15026096","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Medical image De-noising schemes using wavelet transform with fixed form thresholding","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"0318.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060673S","chronDate":"19-21 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7063853","isNumber":"7073349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7063853","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7073349","articleId":"7073435","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7073438,"authors":[{"name":"Hongyan Shi","affiliation":["College of Science, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Hongyan","lastName":"Shi","id":"37879473800"},{"name":"Xiaowei Liu","affiliation":["Department of graduate degree, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Xiaowei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085441436"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7208-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7207-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-7206-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7073438","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":291},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological neural networks","Predictive models","Analytical models","Mathematical model","Principal component analysis","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","neural nets","principal component analysis","share prices","stock markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stock price prediction","Elman neural network","principal component analysis","stock forecasting method","stock market","BP network","backpropagation network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BP neural network","Elman neural network","principal component analysis method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073438","abstract":"Study on the prediction of stock price has great theoretical significance and application value.

Result shows BP network convergence is relatively slow, train for a long time, and could converge to a local minimum; Elman network training time is short, the error bars for smoother and more stable performance; Elman neural network model based on principal component analysis with higher accuracy, faster network speeds.","doi":"10.1109/ICCWAMTIP.2014.7073438","startPage":"411","endPage":"414","publicationTitle":"2014 11th International Computer Conference on Wavelet Actiev Media Technology and Information Processing(ICCWAMTIP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCWAMTIP.2014.7073438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7073349","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 11th International Computer Conference on Wavelet Actiev Media Technology and Information Processing(ICCWAMTIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7063853/7073349/07073438.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application on stock price prediction of Elman neural networks based on principal component analysis method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073438/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Application on stock price prediction of Elman neural networks based on principal component analysis method","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7073438/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15026073","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"19-21 Dec. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Dec. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application on stock price prediction of Elman neural networks based on principal component analysis method","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"0321.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036751S","chronDate":"19-21 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7063853","isNumber":"7073349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7063853","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7073349","articleId":"7073438","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7073447,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Chengdu Technological College, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085512805"},{"name":"Lutao Wang","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Lutao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085505153"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7208-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7207-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-7206-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7073447","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Arrays","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Covariance matrices","Estimation","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","covariance matrices","estimation theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust adaptive beamforming","joint estimation","performance degradation","sample covariance matrix estimation error","steering vector mismatch","covariance errors","shrinkage method","output signal-to noise plus interference ratio","SINR","performance analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Joint Robust","Adaptive Beamforming","Shrinkage Estimation","Quadratic Convex Optimization"]}],"abstract":"Traditional adaptive beamformers have robustness just for specific error condition. They suffer performance degradation in the presence of multiple errors such as sample covariance matrix estimation error and steering vector mismatch. In this article, a new robust adaptive beamforming algorithm based on jointly estimating the covariance matrix and steering vector mismatch is proposed to overcome both the problems of sample covariance errors and steering vector mismatch. The theoretical covariance matrix is estimated based on the shrinkage method. Subsequently, the difference between the actual and presumed steering vectors is estimated in the sense of that the output signal-to noise plus interference ratio (SINR) is maximized and then is used to obtain the actual steering vectors. The proposed algorithm is preferable to traditional ones in the condition of multiple errors. Both simulation results and performance analysis are presented that illustrated the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ICCWAMTIP.2014.7073447","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 11th International Computer Conference on Wavelet Actiev Media Technology and Information Processing(ICCWAMTIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7063853/7073349/07073447.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7073349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCWAMTIP.2014.7073447","publicationTitle":"2014 11th International Computer Conference on Wavelet Actiev Media Technology and Information Processing(ICCWAMTIP)","startPage":"448","endPage":"453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust adaptive beamforming based on jointly estimating","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073447","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Dec. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Robust adaptive beamforming based on jointly estimating","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073447/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7073447/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15026095","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"19-21 Dec. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust adaptive beamforming based on jointly estimating","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"0330.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059334S","chronDate":"19-21 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7063853","isNumber":"7073349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7063853","xplore-issue":"7073349","articleId":"7073447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7073453,"authors":[{"name":"Di Liu","affiliation":["International Center for Wavelet Analysis and Its Applications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu"],"firstName":"Di","lastName":"Liu","id":"37673505200"},{"name":"Libin Zhao","affiliation":["International Center for Wavelet Analysis and Its Applications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu"],"firstName":"Libin","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085381724"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7208-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7207-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-7206-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7073453","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":2289},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Containers","Cloud computing","Virtualization","Engines","Servers","Linux","Computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet technology","virtualization technology","cloud computing system","operating system","OS","storage device","computer network resource","Docker application"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Docker","Linux Container","Cloud Computing","Virtualization"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing is now leading-edge Internet technology and virtualization technology is one of the important part of cloud computing system.

A novel 2-D road representation of an on-road moving target is introduced. A natural description of the target longitudinal and lateral maneuvering behavior in the 2-D road coordinates is given using multiple models. An improved mean-adaptive acceleration model is utilized to describe the longitudinal maneuver modes of the motion. Three estimators based on IMM are developed that use different schemes for fusion of radar and image-sensor-based measurements: centralized, distributed, and sequential. Simulation results are presented that illustrate the performance of the proposed estimators and demonstrate their improved capability compared with a known 1-D road coordinate (mileage) estimator. Furthermore, a hidden Markov model (HMM) formulation and two algorithms for lane-only tracking using lane observations are proposed. A lane observation model is derived from a basic image sensor providing raw observation data. Simulation results show that the proposed HMM-based lane estimators can achieve good performance for lane tracking when only basic image-sensor-based measurements are available.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/7073466/07073476.pdf","startPage":"65","endPage":"80","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2014.120766","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2014.120766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7073466","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilane-road target tracking using radar and image sensors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Roads","Radar tracking","Target tracking","Hidden Markov models","Acceleration","Radar measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","hidden Markov models","image representation","image sensors","radar tracking","remote sensing by radar","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilane-road target tracking","radar","image sensors","maneuvering target","image-sensor-based measurements","2D road representation","on-road moving target","target longitudinal maneuvering behavior","lateral maneuvering behavior","2D road coordinates","mean-adaptive acceleration model","IMM","1D road coordinate estimator","hidden Markov model","HMM formulation","lane-only tracking","lane observation model","HMM-based lane estimators"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073476/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Multilane-road target tracking using radar and image sensors","volume":"51","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7073476/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2015","accessionNumber":"15038614","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilane-road target tracking using radar and image sensors","sourcePdf":"07-itae-51-1-65.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109349S","chronDate":"January  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"7073466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7073466","articleId":"7073476","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7073479,"authors":[{"name":"Victor Iglesias","affiliation":["Grupo de Microondas y Radar, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/7073466/7073479/7073479-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["V\u00edctor Iglesias, was born in Madrid, Spain, in 1984.

The CIG probability density function (pdf) is generalized to account for the additive thermal noise to achieve a good match to real data. The overall pdf is given in an integral form as a function of three parameters which are estimated from the recorded data based on the parametric curve-fitting estimation (PCFE) method of the complementary cumulative distributed function (CCDF). The Nelder-Mead (N-M) simplex algorithm is used to provide the best estimates of the pdf parameters. Using the IPIX backscatter database, the fitting of the CIG pdfs and the cumulative distributed functions (cdfs) are assessed and compared with the fitted Weibull, log-normal, Rician inverse Gaussian (RiIG), K plus noise, compound log-normal (CLN), and Pareto plus noise distributions. Experimental fitting results show that the sea-clutter amplitudes obey the proposed CIG model in most cases.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2014.130332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2014.130332","startPage":"142","endPage":"153","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/7073466/07073481.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7073466","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model for non-rayleigh clutter amplitudes using compound inverse gaussian distribution: an experimental analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2015","displayDocTitle":"Model for non-rayleigh clutter amplitudes using compound inverse gaussian distribution: an experimental analysis","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2015","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2015","volume":"51","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7073481/","accessionNumber":"15038581","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073481/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model for non-rayleigh clutter amplitudes using compound inverse gaussian distribution: an experimental analysis","sourcePdf":"12-itae-51-1-142.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086312S","chronDate":"January  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"7073466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7073466","articleId":"7073481","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7073484,"authors":[{"name":"Zhu Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Broadcom Corporation, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/7073466/7073484/7073484-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhu Chen (S'05-M'12) received the B.S. degree in automation from South-Central University for Nationalities, Wuhan, China, in 2006, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, South Korea, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA, in 2013.","He was a research intern at the Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL), Cambridge, MA, in summer 2012.

The CG is a computationally efficient iterative algorithm, which finds the projection of the AMF weight vector to the Krylov subspace with a dimension growing with the CG iterations. This effectively leads to a family of reduced-rank detectors indexed by the number of CG iterations. The main purpose of this paper is to examine the output signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) of the CG-AMF detector in the presence of strong clutter/interference. Specifically, by exploiting a connection between the CG algorithm and the Lanczos algorithm, we show the output SINR can be asymptotically expressed in a simple form involving a Ritz vector of the sample covariance matrix. The probability density function (pdf) and expected value of the output SINR are then obtained based on this approximation. Our theoretical analysis of the CG-AMF detector is verified by computer simulation. Numerical comparisons are also made with several popular reduced-rank detectors using either data-independent or data-dependent rank reduction approaches. Our results show that for a fixed training size, the CG-AMF detector often reaches its peak output SINR with a lower rank compared with the other reduced-rank detectors, which implies that the CG-AMF detector has lower computational complexity and less training requirement.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2014.130419","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","startPage":"178","endPage":"191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2014.130419","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7073466","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/7073466/07073484.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Vectors","Covariance matrices","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Approximation algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","clutter","computational complexity","conjugate gradient methods","interference (signal)","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conjugate gradient adaptive matched filter","adaptive reduced-rank detector","CG-AMF detector","conjugate gradient algorithm","CG iterations","signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio","SINR","clutter","interference","Lanczos algorithm","probability density function","covariance matrix","theoretical analysis","data-dependent rank reduction","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Conjugate gradient adaptive matched filter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073484/","volume":"51","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7073484/","accessionNumber":"15038626","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2015","publicationDate":"January 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conjugate gradient adaptive matched filter","sourcePdf":"15-itae-51-1-178.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143043S","chronDate":"January  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"7073466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7073466","articleId":"7073484","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7073485,"authors":[{"name":"H.

A closed-form expression for the probability of false alarm of this detector is derived. In addition, a MIMO version of the persymmetric sample matrix inversion (MIMO-PSMI) detector is also developed. Compared to the MIMO-PGLRT detector, MIMO-PSMI has a simpler form and is computationally more efficient. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate that the proposed two detection algorithms can significantly alleviate the requirement of the amount of secondary data and allow for a noticeable improvement in detection performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/7073466/07073498.pdf","startPage":"372","endPage":"382","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2014.130652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2014.130652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7073466","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Persymmetric adaptive target detection with distributed MIMO radar","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Covariance matrices","Vectors","MIMO radar","Noise","Radar antennas","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","covariance matrices","Gaussian noise","matrix inversion","MIMO radar","object detection","radar antennas","radar detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["persymmetric adaptive target detection","distributed MIMO radar","received signals","colored Gaussian noise","persymmetric covariance matrix","spatially dispersed antennas","persymmetric generalized likelihood ratio test detector","closed-form expression","persymmetric sample matrix inversion detector"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073498/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Persymmetric adaptive target detection with distributed MIMO radar","volume":"51","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7073498/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2015","accessionNumber":"15038567","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Persymmetric adaptive target detection with distributed MIMO radar","sourcePdf":"29-itae-51-1-372.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095722S","chronDate":"January  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"7073466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7073466","articleId":"7073498","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7073501,"authors":[{"name":"Michael S.

Time-frequency distributions facilitate the representation of such modulations in a micro-Doppler signature that is useful in the characterization and classification of targets. Reliable micro-Doppler signature classification requires the use of robust features that are capable of uniquely describing the micromotion. Moreover, future applications of micro-Doppler classification will require meaningful representation of the observed target by using a limited set of values. In this paper, the application of the pseudo-Zernike moments for micro-Doppler classification is introduced. Specifically, the proposed algorithm consists of the extraction of the pseudo-Zernike moments from the cadence velocity diagram (CVD). The use of pseudo-Zernike moments allows invariant features to be obtained that are able to discriminate the content of two-dimensional matrices with a small number of coefficients. The analysis has been conducted both on simulated and on real radar data, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach for classification purposes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel algorithm for radar classification based on doppler characteristics exploiting orthogonal Pseudo-Zernike polynomials","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2014.130762","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/7073466/07073502.pdf","startPage":"417","endPage":"430","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2014.130762","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7073466","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073502","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073502/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2015","displayDocTitle":"A novel algorithm for radar classification based on doppler characteristics exploiting orthogonal Pseudo-Zernike polynomials","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"51","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7073502/","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2015","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"January 2015","accessionNumber":"15038571","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A novel algorithm for radar classification based on doppler characteristics exploiting orthogonal Pseudo-Zernike polynomials","sourcePdf":"33-itae-51-1-417.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069194S","chronDate":"January  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"7073466","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"7073466","articleId":"7073502","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":7073504,"authors":[{"name":"Louis B.

In this paper, two new closed-form expressions that quantify the loss associated with the STAP notch centered on clutter are derived in terms of system parameters of interest. Although there are many excellent reports, books, and papers focused on STAP, a simple yet accurate approximation for the STAP notch has not previously appeared. It is also shown that a new, accurate approximation for the important STAP metric known as minimum detectable velocity may be derived from the STAP notch expression. Furthermore, accurate expressions are derived that predict when \u201caperture-limited\u201d STAP performance may be obtained. This work provides the first analytical, unifying connection between these STAP metrics. As they are implemented in compact closed-form expressions, the new results are attractive for system design. The significant computational benefits associated with the new results can be very advantageous in trade studies or large simulations in which STAP performance estimates must be computed thousands of times. It is expected that this work will be of great use to both readers with a background in STAP and readers new to this field. For readers with STAP experience, this work provides a new understanding of the drivers of STAP performance and of the interconnections between STAP performance measures. For readers new to the STAP field, this work removes the mystery associated with STAP by providing intuition into how STAP works. With accurate, analytical expressions, system engineers can now implement accurate predictions of STAP performance without the necessity of constructing patch-based analysis tools that estimate STAP performance by computing the notch associated with hundreds to thousands of clutter patches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical expressions for space-time adaptive processing (STAP) performance","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2014.130676","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/7073466/07073504.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"53","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2014.130676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7073466","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073504/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2015","displayDocTitle":"Analytical expressions for space-time adaptive processing (STAP) performance","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"51","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7073504/","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2015","publicationDate":"January 2015","accessionNumber":"15038622","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical expressions for space-time adaptive processing (STAP) performance","sourcePdf":"35-itae-51-1-442.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092662S","chronDate":"January  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"7073466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7073466","articleId":"7073504","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7073512,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengzheng Li","affiliation":["Radar Innovation Lab, Norman, OK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/7073466/7073512/7073512-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhengzheng Li received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Nankai University, Tianjin, China, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.

To avoid such hazardous errors, code-carrier divergence (CCD) monitors have been applied to support the use of GBAS in Category I (CAT I) operation. However, to meet the stricter requirements for CAT II/III operation, it may be necessary to greatly improve the speed with which existing CCD monitors detect ionospheric gradients or develop an innovative divergence monitor. One way of obtaining stricter integrity is to detect anomalous divergence behavior more rapidly than the CCD monitor does. Therefore, we attempted to devise a divergence monitor in which the detection time is reduced by using the Kullback-Leibler information. In simulations and experimental results, we demonstrate that the proposed divergence measure is quite capable of detecting ionospheric anomalies that are hazardous to GBAS and is a very promising alternative for the detection of deviations. A comparison with existing CCD monitors shows its increased fault detectability, which enables it to sense even small ionospheric gradients more rapidly than typical monitors.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2014.130498","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/7073466/07073513.pdf","startPage":"565","endPage":"574","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2014.130498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7073466","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GBAS ionospheric anomaly monitoring strategy using Kullback-Leibler divergence metric","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073513","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 April 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073513/","displayDocTitle":"GBAS ionospheric anomaly monitoring strategy using Kullback-Leibler divergence metric","volume":"51","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2015","accessionNumber":"15038604","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7073513/","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GBAS ionospheric anomaly monitoring strategy using Kullback-Leibler divergence metric","sourcePdf":"44-itae-51-1-565.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064132S","chronDate":"January  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"7073466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7073466","articleId":"7073513","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":7073564,"authors":[{"name":"Haoyuan Wei","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Haoyuan","lastName":"Wei","id":"37085396808"},{"name":"Xiaopeng Jiao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xiaopeng","lastName":"Jiao","id":"37895360200"},{"name":"Jianjun Mu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jianjun","lastName":"Mu","id":"37701802500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7073564","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":761},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Standards","Signal to noise ratio","Vectors","Iterative decoding","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","computational geometry","iterative methods","linear programming","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced-complexity linear programming decoding","ADMM-based LP decoder","LDPC codes","low-density parity-check codes","Euclidean projection","check polytopes","alternating direction method-of-multipliers","absolute values","current iteration","decoding time","early termination technique","over-relaxation technique","decoding complexity reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linear programming decoding","alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)","reduce-complexity"]},{"kwd":["Linear programming decoding","alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)","reduce-complexity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073564","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7119623/07073564.pdf","startPage":"909","endPage":"912","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2418261","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2418261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7119623","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced-Complexity Linear Programming Decoding Based on ADMM for LDPC Codes","abstract":"The Euclidean projection onto check polytopes is the most time-consuming operation in the linear programming (LP) decoding based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.

However, traditional CCFR systems do not handle noisy data effectively. By analyzing in detail the basic strokes of Chinese characters, we propose that font recognition on a single Chinese character is a sequence classification problem, which can be effectively solved by recurrent neural networks. For robust CCFR, we integrate a principal component convolution layer with the 2-D long short-term memory (2DLSTM) and develop principal component 2DLSTM (PC-2DLSTM) algorithm. PC-2DLSTM considers two aspects: 1) the principal component layer convolution operation helps remove the noise and get a rational and complete font information and 2) simultaneously, 2DLSTM deals with the long-range contextual processing along scan directions that can contribute to capture the contrast between character trajectory and background. Experiments using the frequently used CCFR dataset suggest the effectiveness of PC-2DLSTM compared with other state-of-the-art font recognition methods.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2015.2414920","startPage":"756","endPage":"765","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/7406788/07073574.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2015.2414920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7406788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Principal Component 2-D Long Short-Term Memory for Font Recognition on Single Chinese Characters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Character recognition","Accuracy","Convolution","Vectors","Principal component analysis","Signal to noise ratio","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["character recognition","image classification","principal component analysis","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["principal component 2D long short-term memory","single Chinese characters","Chinese character font recognition","CCFR","sequence classification problem","recurrent neural networks","principal component convolution layer","2DLSTM","character trajectory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Font recognition","long short-term memory","neurodynamic models","optical character recognition","recurrent neural networks (RNNs)"]},{"kwd":["Font recognition","long short-term memory","neurodynamic models","optical character recognition","recurrent neural networks (RNNs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073574/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","displayDocTitle":"Principal Component 2-D Long Short-Term Memory for Font Recognition on Single Chinese Characters","volume":"46","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7073574/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15786257","pubMedId":"25838536","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61125106, 61075021 and 61472144"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Support Plan","grantNumber":"2013BAH65F01 and 2013BAH65F04"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Natural Science Funds","grantNumber":"2014A030310252"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Province Universities and Colleges Pearl River Scholar Funded Scheme","grantNumber":"2011"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Scientific and Technology Research Plan","grantNumber":"2012A010701001 and 2012B091100396"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Technology Project","grantNumber":"JCYJ20140901003939001"},{"fundingName":"Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China","grantNumber":"20120172110023"},{"fundingName":"Shaanxi Key Innovation Team of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"2012KCT-04"},{"fundingName":"Opening Project of State Key Laboratory of Digital Publishing Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Principal Component 2-D Long Short-Term Memory for Font Recognition on Single Chinese Characters","sourcePdf":"tcyb-tao-2414920-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108257S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7406788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"7406788","articleId":"7073574","onlineDate":"31 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7073589,"authors":[{"name":"Hongguang Sun","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Institute of Information Science, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7182829/7073589/sun-2418192-small.gif","p":["\n\nHongguang Sun (S'14) received the B.S. degree from Northeastern \nUniversity at Qinhuangdao, Qinhuangdao, China, in 2009.

Dynamic time-division duplex (TDD) has the capability to accommodate to the traffic asymmetry by adapting the UL/DL configuration to the current traffic demands. In this work, we study a two-tier heterogeneous cellular network (HCN) where the macro tier and small cell tier operate according to a dynamic TDD scheme on orthogonal frequency bands. To offload the network infrastructure, mobile users in proximity can engage in device-to-device (D2D) communications, whose activity is determined by a carrier sensing multiple access (CSMA) scheme to protect the ongoing infrastructure-based and D2D transmissions. We present an analytical framework for evaluating the network performance in terms of load-aware coverage probability and network throughput. The proposed framework allows quantification of the effect on the coverage probability of the most important TDD system parameters, such as the UL/DL configuration, the base station density, and the bias factor. In addition, we evaluate how the bandwidth partition and the D2D network access scheme affect the total network throughput. Through the study of the tradeoff between coverage probability and D2D user activity, we provide guidelines for the optimal design of D2D network access.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2418192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7182829","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2418192","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7182829/07073589.pdf","startPage":"4204","endPage":"4218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"D2D Enhanced Heterogeneous Cellular Networks With Dynamic TDD","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"D2D Enhanced Heterogeneous Cellular Networks With Dynamic TDD","volume":"14","issue":"8","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7073589/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15364425","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073589/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61231008, 61172079, 61201141, 61301176, 91338114 and 61401320"},{"fundingName":"863 project","grantNumber":"2014AA01A701"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"B08038"},{"fundingName":"Basic Research Fund in Xidian University","grantNumber":"7214497201"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"BDY011401"},{"fundingName":"SUTD-MIT International Design Centre","grantNumber":"IDSF1200106OH"},{"fundingName":"ASTAR SERC","grantNumber":"1224104048"},{"fundingName":"MOE Academic Research Fund Tier 2","grantNumber":"MOE2014-T2-2-002"},{"fundingName":"SRG ISTD","grantNumber":"2012037"},{"fundingName":"SUTD-MIT International Design Centre","grantNumber":"IDSF1200106OH"},{"fundingName":"ASTAR SERC","grantNumber":"1224104048"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"D2D Enhanced Heterogeneous Cellular Networks With Dynamic TDD","sourcePdf":"twc-sheng-2418192-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.170148S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7182829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"7182829","articleId":"7073589","onlineDate":"31 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7073597,"authors":[{"name":"Vivek Thotla","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/7254208/7073597/thotl-2415112-small.gif","p":["Vivek Thotla (S\u201911\u2013M\u201911) received the bachelor\u2019s degree from the Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology, Hyderabad, India, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA, in 2015.","His current research interests include detection, identification, localization of electronic devices through their unintended emissions, and RF measurements."]},"firstName":"Vivek","lastName":"Thotla","id":"38252044500"},{"name":"Maciej Zawodniok","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/7254208/7073597/zawod-2415112-small.gif","p":["Maciej Zawodniok (S\u201903\u2013M\u201906) received the M.Sc. degree in computer science from the Silesian University of Technology, Gliwice, Poland, in 1999, and the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from the Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA, in 2006.","He has been with the Missouri University of Science and Technology, since 2008, where he is currently an Assistant Professor of Computer Engineering and an Assistant Director of the NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center, Berkeley, CA, USA, involved in intelligent maintenance systems.

In addition, reliable detection of radio controlled (RC) devices in the presence of multiple actual devices is a challenging task. RC devices employing super regenerative receivers (SRRs) and super heterodyne receivers emit unintended radiations in their ON-state. This paper introduces a novel detection scheme that combines self-similarity and received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-based detection with minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) method. In addition, detection accuracy is improved using multiconstrained genetic algorithms (GAs). RSSI method detects multiple devices from received signal strength and Hurst parameter identifies self-similar SRR devices. Regularized MVDR improves detection of multiple devices by jamming unwanted signals and signals from known angle of arrival. Regularization reduces variation in detection due to environmental noise. Multiconstrained GA is implemented in the cases where MVDR fails. The experimental results for detection have also been presented for multiple SRR receivers (door bells at 315 MHz).","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2015.2415112","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/7254208/07073597.pdf","startPage":"2821","endPage":"2828","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2015.2415112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7254208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of Multiple R/C Devices Using MVDR and Genetic Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073597/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Detection of Multiple R/C Devices Using MVDR and Genetic Algorithms","volume":"64","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15452564","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7073597/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Multiple R/C Devices Using MVDR and Genetic Algorithms","sourcePdf":"tim-thotla-2415112-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091493S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"7254208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","xplore-issue":"7254208","articleId":"7073597","onlineDate":"31 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7073601,"authors":[{"name":"Ugur Hasirci","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, D\u00fczce University, D\u00fczce, Turkey"],"bio":{"p":["Ugur Hasirci was born in Ankara, Turkey, in 1980.

Some 2-D magnetic analyses based on current sheet model or transmission line approach for the LIL type launchers are available in the literature, but this paper provides an alternative way to analyze LIL type of EMLs using 3-D FEM. The analysis examines the variation of propulsion, levitation, and guidance forces induced in the moving part.

However, low RFET efficiency is still a fundamental bottleneck in its widespread usage. Multi-hop RF energy transfer (MHET) can improve the RFET efficiency by deploying relay nodes that scavenge the dispersed energy and transfer it to the nearby sensor node. The efficiency of MHET is strongly influenced by the relay node's placement. To maximize the RFET efficiency for a two-hop scenario, in this paper a novel optimization model is proposed to determine the optimal relay placement (ORP) on an Euclidean x-y plane. Nontrivial tradeoff between the energy scavenged at the relay versus the effective energy delivered by the relay to the target node is investigated. Due to the nonconvex and highly nonlinear nature of the optimization problem, an \u03b1-based branch and bound algorithm has been used. The proposed optimization model is further extended by incorporating distributed beamforming to enhance the RFET efficiency. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed algorithm provides convergence to the \u03f5-global optimal solution in a few iterations, and ORP provides significant energy saving over arbitrary relay positions for commercial RF energy harvesting systems.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2418253","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7108080/07073612.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2418253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7108080","startPage":"1635","endPage":"1647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Relay Placement in Two-Hop RF Energy Transfer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073612","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Relay Placement in Two-Hop RF Energy Transfer","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073612/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15142295","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7073612/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Department of Electronics and Information Technology","grantNumber":"13(2)/2012-CC&BT"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Relay Placement in Two-Hop RF Energy Transfer","sourcePdf":"tcomm-de-2418253-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098161S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7108080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7108080","articleId":"7073612","onlineDate":"31 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7073625,"authors":[{"name":"Nhat-Quang Nhan","affiliation":["Telecom Bretagne, Signal and Communications Department, CNRS, UMR 6285 Lab-STICC, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Nhat-Quang","lastName":"Nhan","id":"37085562663"},{"name":"Telex M.

In this paper, an underlay SR model is proposed for an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) system to share the spectrum of a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system through intelligently exploiting the interference margin provided by the CDMA system when operating with a low system load. The asymptotic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the CDMA system is used to quantify the interference margin, which interestingly does not depend on the instantaneous information (spreading codes and channel state information) of the CDMA system, thanks to its internal power control. By using the transmit power constraints together with the derived interference margin, the uplink resource allocation problem for OFDMA system is formulated and solved through dual decomposition method. The proposed SR system only requires high level system parameters from the CDMA system, hence, the upgrading of legacy CDMA system is not needed. Simulation results have verified our theoretical analysis, and validated the effectiveness of the proposed resource allocation algorithm and its capability to protect the legacy CDMA users.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2418196","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7108080/07073632.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7108080","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2418196","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","startPage":"1895","endPage":"1906","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum Refarming: A New Paradigm of Spectrum Sharing for Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073632","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Refarming: A New Paradigm of Spectrum Sharing for Cellular Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073632/","volume":"63","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7073632/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15163398","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Republic of Singapore's National Research Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Refarming: A New Paradigm of Spectrum Sharing for Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-liang-2418196-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077469S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7108080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7108080","articleId":"7073632","onlineDate":"31 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7073634,"authors":[{"name":"Xinsong Yang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Chongqing Normal University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/7337513/7073634/yang-small.gif","p":["Xinsong Yang received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Huaihua\n Normal University, Hunan, China, in 1992, and the M.S. degree in mathematics from Yunnan University, Yunnan, China, in\n 2006.","From 2006 to 2012, he was with Honghe University, Honghe State, Yunnan.

The complex networks consist of several clusters of nonidentical discontinuous systems suffered from uncertain bounded external disturbance. Based on the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy interpolation approach, we first obtain a set of T-S fuzzy complex networks with constant coupling strengths. By developing some novel Lyapunov functionals and using the concept of Filippov solution, some new analytical techniques are established to derive sufficient conditions ensuring the cluster synchronization in a setting time. In particular, this paper extends the pinning control strategies for networks with continuous-time dynamics to discontinuous networks.

The interference modeling and the capacity analysis is performed based on the microfluidic channel geometry, the flow velocity, and the distance. During the analysis, time-scale of biological oscillators is specifically targeted, which is in the range of several minutes to a few hours. The signal-to-interference and noise ratio is shown to be constant with respect to the location of the interfering transmitter. The capacity of the MC link between the designated transmitter and the corresponding receiver is shown to be upper bounded by 1 bit/per channel use when exposed to a single interfering transmitter. For the multiple, i.e., N, transmitters, the decay of pairwise MC capacity is also studied as a factor of N. Finally, placement of the two transmitter and receiver pairs on the opposite sides of the microfluidic channel is studied. Three different microfluidic interference channel configurations, i.e., both-sided interference (microfluidic X channel), one-sided interference (microfluidic Z channel), and interference-free, are proposed based on the distance of the receiver from the interfering transmitter, microfluidic channel cross section, and the fluid flow velocity. For large-scale integration of chemical analysis systems on a microfluidic chip, the provided information-theoretic analysis and the capacity expressions for the MIC can be utilized to analyze the throughput of the chip, which can lead to improvement in efficiency and optimization of the design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073637/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7073637/","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15108290","volume":"14","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Interference Modeling and Capacity Analysis for Microfluidic Molecular Communication Channels","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1110947"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Modeling and Capacity Analysis for Microfluidic Molecular Communication Channels","sourcePdf":"tnano-bicen-2418175-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115899S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"7102804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7102804","articleId":"7073637","onlineDate":"31 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7073641,"authors":[{"name":"Shuiyin Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7182829/7073641/liu-2417886-small.gif","p":["\n\nShuiyin Liu (M'13) received the B.Eng. degree in electronic and \ninformation engineering from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2006, and the master's and Ph.D. degrees from \nImperial College London, U.K., in 2007 and 2011, respectively.

In this work, we study the ergodic secret capacity of a multiple-input multiple-output multiple-antenna-eavesdropper (MIMOME) wiretap channel with quantized channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter and perfect CSI at the legitimate receiver, under the assumption that only the statistics of eavesdropper CSI is known at the transmitter. We refine the analysis of Lin et al.'s random vector quantization (RVQ) based artificial noise (AN) scheme, where a heuristic upper bound on the secrecy rate loss (compared to the perfect CSI case) was given. We propose a lower bound on the ergodic secrecy capacity. We show that the lower bound and the secrecy capacity with perfect CSI coincide asymptotically as the number of feedback bits and the AN power go to infinity. For practical applications, we propose a very efficient quantization codebook construction method for the two transmit antennas case.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Guaranteeing Positive Secrecy Capacity for MIMOME Wiretap Channels With Finite-Rate Feedback Using Artificial Noise","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2417886","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7182829/07073641.pdf","startPage":"4193","endPage":"4203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2417886","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7182829","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073641","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073641/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Guaranteeing Positive Secrecy Capacity for MIMOME Wiretap Channels With Finite-Rate Feedback Using Artificial Noise","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7073641/","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15364395","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Monash Software Defined Telecommunications Lab"},{"fundingName":"Australian Research Council Discovery Project","grantNumber":"ARC DP130100336"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guaranteeing Positive Secrecy Capacity for MIMOME Wiretap Channels With Finite-Rate Feedback Using Artificial Noise","sourcePdf":"twc-viterbo-2417886-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14432S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7182829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7182829","articleId":"7073641","onlineDate":"31 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7073644,"authors":[{"name":"Elie BouDaher","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Communications, Villanova University, Villanova, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Elie","lastName":"BouDaher","id":"37085371855"},{"name":"Fauzia Ahmad","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Communications, Villanova University, Villanova, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Fauzia","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"37285133400"},{"name":"Moeness G.

In the case of binary erasure channels (BECs), certain error-prone patterns, known as stopping sets, are proven to cause this performance degradation. A possible approach to diminish this drawback over BECs is to eliminate stopping sets by parity-check matrix extension. Given a parity-check matrix H, and a list L of its stopping sets, we present an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation to find a parity-check equation which eliminates the maximum number of stopping sets in L. One of the distinguishing advantages of the proposed scheme is its flexibility for modifications such as: limiting the weight of the new parity-check row, making the new row redundant or linearly independent, 4-cycle avoidance, and taking into account the sizes of stopping sets. Armed with these adjustments, the method can provide good performance improvements, as evidenced by simulation results. Furthermore, for a given Q \u2208 N, by extending the basic formulation, we provide an ILP formulation for finding a set of size Q of parity-check equations which can best eliminate the stopping sets in L, among all such sets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073646/","volume":"63","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7073646/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15142306","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Stopping Set Elimination by Parity-Check Matrix Extension via Integer Linear Programming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stopping Set Elimination by Parity-Check Matrix Extension via Integer Linear Programming","sourcePdf":"tcomm-falsafain-2418263-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084205S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7108080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"7108080","articleId":"7073646","onlineDate":"31 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7073649,"authors":[{"name":"Wenli Zhang","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Systems, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Wenli Zhang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in materials science\n and engineering from the Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2003 and 2006, respectively, and the\n Ph.D. degree from the University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA, in 2011, in the area of advanced ceramic materials\n and processing.","He is currently a Research Assistant Professor working at the Center for Power Electronics Systems, Virginia Tech,\n Blacksburg, VA, USA.

These superior characteristics make GaN HEMTs ideal for high-frequency, high-efficiency power conversion. Using efficient GaN HEMT devices switched at high frequency in power electronic systems could lead to an increase in power density as well as a reduction in the weight, size, and cost of the system. However, conventional packaging configurations often compromise the benefits provided by high-performance GaN HEMT devices, for example, by increasing the parasitic inductance and resistance in the current loops of the device. This undesirable package-induced performance degradation is prominent in the cascode GaN device, where the combination of a high-voltage depletion-mode GaN semiconductor and low-voltage enhancement-mode Si semiconductor is needed. In this study, a new package is introduced for high-voltage cascode GaN devices and is successfully demonstrated to make the device more suitable for megahertz operation. This packaging prototype for cascode GaN devices is fabricated in a power quad flat no-lead format with the new features of a stack-die structure, embedded external capacitor, and flip-chip configuration. The parasitic ringing in hard-switching turn-off and switching losses in soft-switching transitions are both effectively reduced for this newly packaged device compared with a traditional package using the same GaN and Si devices. Improved thermal dissipation capability is also realized using this new package for better reliability.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power

As the input signal bandwidth increases, the required bandwidth on the DPD feedback channel becomes even larger, i.e., normally five times the signal bandwidth. However, the DPD feedback bandwidth is often restricted by the nonideal electronic components, e.g., the anti-aliasing filter and associated circuits, which therefore introduce bandwidth mismatch between the PA model basis functions and the feedback signal, and thus degrade the linearization performances of the DPD. This paper presents a general DPD architecture for wideband PA systems with constrained feedback bandwidth. By using linear operations to cancel the bandwidth mismatch between the proposed model and the PA feedback signal, the full-band PA model parameters can be estimated with bandwidth-limited observations. This estimated PA model is subsequently used with the PA input signal to extract the DPD function by applying the direct learning algorithms. The proposed DPD architecture reduces the feedback bandwidth to less than two times that of the input signal, while it maintains its linearization performance, as in the full-band case. Experiments are performed on the 20- and 100-MHz long-term evolution advanced signals to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PA behavior modeling and DPD linearization performances with limited feedback bandwidth.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A General Digital Predistortion Architecture Using Constrained Feedback Bandwidth for Wideband Power Amplifiers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2015.2416184","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7101309/07073653.pdf","startPage":"1544","endPage":"1555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2015.2416184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7101309","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073653","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073653/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","displayDocTitle":"A General Digital Predistortion Architecture Using Constrained Feedback Bandwidth for Wideband Power Amplifiers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7073653/","dateOfInsertion":"04 May 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15107891","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A General Digital Predistortion Architecture Using Constrained Feedback Bandwidth for Wideband Power Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"tmtt-liu-2416184-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.175775S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7101309","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7101309","articleId":"7073653","onlineDate":"31 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7073664,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Po Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/7416019/7073664/7073664-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu-Po Lin (S\u201910) received B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from the Lunghwa University of Science and Technology, Taoyuan, Taiwan, in 2008 and 2010, respectively.","In 2010, he joined the Neuromorphic and Biomedical Engineering (NBME) laboratory at National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, where is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.

As rat models provide the advantage of recording and stimulating different disease-related regions simultaneously, this paper proposes a battery-less, implantable neuro-electronic interface suitable for studying DBS mechanisms with a freely-moving rat. The neuro-electronic interface mainly consists of a microsystem able to interact with eight different brain regions bi-directionally and simultaneously. To minimize the size of the implant, the microsystem receives power and transmits data through a single coil. In addition, particular attention is paid to the capability of recording neural activities right after each stimulation, so as to acquire information on how stimulations modulate neural activities. The microsystem has been fabricated with the standard 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS technology. The chip area is 7.74 mm \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, and the microsystem is able to operate with a single supply voltage of 1 V. The wireless interface allows a maximum power of 10 mW to be transmitted together with either uplink or downlink data at a rate of 2 Mbps or 100 kbps, respectively. The input referred noise of recording amplifiers is 1.16 \u03bcVrms, and the stimulation voltage is tunable from 1.5 V to 4.5 V with 5-bit resolution. After the electrical functionality of the microsystem is tested, the capability of the microsystem to interface with rat brain is further examined and compared with conventional instruments. All experimental results are presented and discussed in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2015.2403282","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/4156126/7416019/07073664.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2015.2403282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7416019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Battery-Less, Implantable Neuro-Electronic Interface for Studying the Mechanisms of Deep Brain Stimulation in Rat Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073664","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073664/","displayDocTitle":"A Battery-Less, Implantable Neuro-Electronic Interface for Studying the Mechanisms of Deep Brain Stimulation in Rat Models","volume":"10","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15802429","pubMedId":"25838526","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7073664/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001868","fundingName":"","grantNumber":"NSC 100-2220-E-007-011, NSC101-2311-B-007-012-MY3 and NSC 102-2923-B-007-001-MY3"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005057","fundingName":""}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Battery-Less, Implantable Neuro-Electronic Interface for Studying the Mechanisms of Deep Brain Stimulation in Rat Models","sourcePdf":"tbcas-chen-2403282-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126653S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"7416019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"7416019","articleId":"7073664","onlineDate":"31 March 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7073665,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The real IoT is a network of devices with local intelligence (sensors, lights, gas pumps, HVAC systems), which shares access & control mechanisms to push and pull status and command information from the networked world. However, there are still some issues, limiting the IoT diffusion: the devices involved are heterogeneous, with proprietary system of chips, protocols and interface; furthermore, there is a lack of development toolkits, enabling developers to create and evaluate IoT prototypes in simple and flexible manner. The ebbits [1] platform addressed those issues, taking advantages from the IoT vision and providing a middleware infrastructure for the integration of heterogeneous industrial devices and sensors, transforming them into web services and thus enabling their seamless integration into existing legacy systems. This paper will introduce the platform and its software architecture, describing features like semantic devices interoperability and entity virtualization. Furthermore, the paper will describe an innovative, IoT oriented, model driven development toolkit. This toolkit leverages on the semantic discovery service, allowing to dynamically selecting and locating available resources or devices, and provides a flexible instrument, including a graphical interface, that enables developers to compose mashup applications.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7073795","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIN.2015.7073828","publicationTitle":"2015 18th International Conference on Intelligence in Next Generation Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 18th International Conference on Intelligence in Next Generation Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/7070910/7073795/07073828.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"175","doi":"10.1109/ICIN.2015.7073828","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Industrial application development exploiting IoT vision and model driven programming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Feb. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Industrial application development exploiting IoT vision and model driven programming","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Feb. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7073828/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2015","accessionNumber":"15034821","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073828/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Industrial application development exploiting IoT vision and model driven programming","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p168-conzon.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058018S","chronDate":"17-19 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7070910","isNumber":"7073795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7070910","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7073795","articleId":"7073828","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7073830,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085526656"},{"name":"Jiangtao Wen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiangtao","lastName":"Wen","id":"37291696100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1866-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7073830","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":98,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":3724},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data models","Cryptography","Proposals","Internet","Protocols","Companies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["contracts","electronic commerce","electronic money","Internet","Internet of Things","peer-to-peer computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IoT electric business model","bitcoin protocol","e-business activities","Internet of things","Internet","smart property","paid data","P2P trade","Blockchain","smart contract"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["E-business model","Internet of things","bitcoin"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073830","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 18th International Conference on Intelligence in Next Generation Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/7070910/7073795/07073830.pdf","startPage":"184","endPage":"191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIN.2015.7073830","doi":"10.1109/ICIN.2015.7073830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7073795","publicationTitle":"2015 18th International Conference on Intelligence in Next Generation Networks","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An IoT electric business model based on the protocol of bitcoin","abstract":"Nowadays, the development of traditional business models become more and more mature that people use them to guide various kinds of E-business activities.

In traditional circuit design on-chip communications have been designed with dedicated point-to-point interconnections or shared buses. Therefore, regular data transfer is the major concern of many parallel implementations. However, when dealing with the SMVM operation, which is the main step of most iterative algorithms for solving systems of linear equations, the required data transfers are usually dependent on the sparsity structure of the matrix and can be extremely irregular. Using a NoC architecture makes it possible to deal with arbitrary structure of the data transfers, i.e. with arbitrary structured sparse matrices. In this paper, a configurable interface is presented which can generate the pipelined SMVM calculator based on NoC architecture with size of 2\u00d72, 4\u00d74, ..., p\u00d7p (p \u2208 \u2115). The implementation is done in IEEE-754 single floating-point precision on the Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA.","publicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7069644/7069645/07073850.pdf","startPage":"744","endPage":"748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7069645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA acceleration of Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication based on Network-on-Chip","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"FPGA acceleration of Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication based on Network-on-Chip","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7073850/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"15033870","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA acceleration of Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication based on Network-on-Chip","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"1569415997.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098756S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"7069644","isNumber":"7069645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7069644","xplore-issue":"7069645","articleId":"7073850","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7073853,"authors":[{"name":"G\u00e9rard Favier","affiliation":["I3S Laboratory, University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis, CNRS, Sophia Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"G\u00e9rard","lastName":"Favier","id":"37266039600"},{"name":"Michele N. da Costa","affiliation":["DSPCom Laboratory, University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Campinas, Brazil","I3S Laboratory, University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis, CNRS, Sophia Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Michele N.","lastName":"da Costa","id":"37085661482"},{"name":"Andr\u00e9 L.F. de Almeida","affiliation":["Department of Teleinformatics Engineering, Federal University of Cear\u00e1, Fortaleza, Brazil"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e9 L.F.","lastName":"de Almeida","id":"37290281500"},{"name":"Jo\u00e3o Marcos T.

While the transmitters and the receiver are assumed to have a single antenna, the relay is equipped with multiple antennas. Thus, spatial processing can be applied at the relay, which is subject to optimization for achieving higher data rates. This optimization problem is non-convex and hard to solve in general. However, for the two special cases in which either the direct links between transmitter and receiver are not present or the relay operates in another frequency band, we are able to derive upper and lower bounds that are performing reasonably well for a large set of parameters. Using the insights from the special cases, we also obtain upper and lower bounds for the general case.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7069644/7069645/07073876.pdf","startPage":"1829","endPage":"1833","publicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7069645","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073876","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achievable sum-rates in the two-user Gaussian multiple-access channel with a MIMO-AF-relay","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Upper bound","Transmitters","Vectors","Receivers","MIMO","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","concave programming","Gaussian channels","MIMO communication","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-user Gaussian multiple-access channel","MAC","MIMO-AF-relay","achievable sum-rates","amplify-and-forward full-duplex relay","spatial processing","nonconvex optimization","special cases","upper bounds","lower bounds","general case"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073876/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"Achievable sum-rates in the two-user Gaussian multiple-access channel with a MIMO-AF-relay","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7073876/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"15033793","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achievable sum-rates in the two-user Gaussian multiple-access channel with a MIMO-AF-relay","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"1569421461.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037278S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"7069644","isNumber":"7069645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7069644","xplore-issue":"7069645","articleId":"7073876","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7073883,"authors":[{"name":"Mart\u00ed Ma\u00f1osas-Caball\u00fa","affiliation":["Telecommunications and Systems Engineering Department, Universitat Aut\u00f3noma de Barcelona Edifici Q - Campus de la UAB, Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Mart\u00ed","lastName":"Ma\u00f1osas-Caball\u00fa","id":"37085737514"},{"name":"Gonzalo Seco-Granados","affiliation":["Telecommunications and Systems Engineering Department, Universitat Aut\u00f3noma de Barcelona Edifici Q - Campus de la UAB, Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Gonzalo","lastName":"Seco-Granados","id":"37085722477"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7073883","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Array signal processing","Synchronization","Protocols","Frequency synchronization","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","radio transmitters","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust time-slotted round-trip carrier","timing synchronization","distributed beamforming","multiuser wireless communication systems","antenna array","carrier synchronization","transmitters","timing synchronization protocol","maximum beamforming gain"]}],"abstract":"Distributed beamforming has arisen as a significant approach in multi-user wireless communication systems. It allows several transmitters with common information to emulate an antenna array and focus their transmissions towards an intended destination. However, carrier and timing synchronization among the transmitters is necessary to ensure that the information is aimed in the desired direction. In this work we present a robust time-slotted round-trip carrier and timing synchronization protocol that is valid in dynamic environments in the sense that sensors can disappear from the network without affecting the performance severely. The protocol is based on the execution of simple rules at each sensor and leaves freedom to choose those signals that provide better timing synchronization. Numerical results show that a large fraction of the maximum beamforming gain can be maintained for death ratios as high as 50%.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7069644/7069645/07073883.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7069645","publicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","startPage":"1190","endPage":"1194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust time-slotted round-trip carrier and timing synchronization for distributed beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073883","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"Robust time-slotted round-trip carrier and timing synchronization for distributed beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073883/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7073883/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"15033947","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust time-slotted round-trip carrier and timing synchronization for distributed beamforming","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"1569421585.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.153517S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"7069644","isNumber":"7069645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7069644","xplore-issue":"7069645","articleId":"7073883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7073890,"authors":[{"name":"Victoria Zabrodina","affiliation":["Department of Transmitters, National Aerospace University, Kharkov, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Victoria","lastName":"Zabrodina","id":"37542559000"},{"name":"Sergey Abramov","affiliation":["Department of Transmitters, National Aerospace University, Kharkov, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Sergey","lastName":"Abramov","id":"37265446300"},{"name":"Vladimir Lukin","affiliation":["Department of Transmitters, National Aerospace University, Kharkov, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Lukin","id":"37284917600"},{"name":"Jaakko Astola","affiliation":["Institute for Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Jaakko","lastName":"Astola","id":"37269699600"},{"name":"Benoit Vozel","affiliation":["University of Rennes I, Lannion cedex, BP, France"],"firstName":"Benoit","lastName":"Vozel","id":"37372887000"},{"name":"Kacem Chehdi","affiliation":["University of Rennes I, Lannion cedex, BP, France"],"firstName":"Kacem","lastName":"Chehdi","id":"37313378600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7073890","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Estimation","Fitting","Accuracy","Robustness","Least squares approximations","Additives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["curve fitting","image processing","parameter estimation","polynomials","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mixed noise parameters estimation","robust regression curve fitting","blind estimation method","signal dependent noise parameter estimation","polynomial regression","simulated signal dependent noise"]}],"abstract":"Methods for blind estimation of signal dependent noise parameters from scatter-plots by polynomial regression are considered.

The combination between the cooperative system with MIMO is useful to provide a high data rate with a high quality of 3-D video services. By taking the advantages of these techniques, this paper presents 3-D video transmission over cooperative MIMO system. The proposed system based on a partitioning scheme, which uses adaptive allocation of Variable Length Codes (VLCs) with Unequal Error Protection (UEP) scheme for left and right views. In this scheme, video data is partitioned according to its importance into high priority (HP) and low priority (LP) coefficients. Because the video signal is usually sensitive to bit error, two methods are proposed. The first proposed technique is to interleave the Resynchronization pattern between VLCs to isolate the propagation of errors over the video stream. The second method is to improve the performance of the video decoder decision at lower values of Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error-resilient video transmission for 3-D signal over Cooperative-MIMO system","publicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7069644/7069645/07073895.pdf","startPage":"1372","endPage":"1376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7069645","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073895","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073895/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"Error-resilient video transmission for 3-D signal over Cooperative-MIMO system","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7073895/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"15026585","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error-resilient video transmission for 3-D signal over Cooperative-MIMO system","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"1569421919.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062358S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"7069644","isNumber":"7069645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7069644","xplore-issue":"7069645","articleId":"7073895","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7073898,"authors":[{"name":"Siavash Rahimi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec"],"firstName":"Siavash","lastName":"Rahimi","id":"38491685200"},{"name":"Benoit Champagne","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec"],"firstName":"Benoit","lastName":"Champagne","id":"37296590000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7073898","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Transceivers","Prototypes","Bit error rate","Discrete Fourier transforms","Attenuation","Filter banks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","discrete Fourier transforms","error statistics","matrix algebra","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["perfect reconstruction DFT modulated oversampled filter bank transceivers","discrete Fourier transform","FB","multicarrier transceiver systems","PR property","paraunitary constraint","polyphase matrix","Givens rotations","stop-band energy","spectral containment","FB structures","bit error rate"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073898","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel method for the design of perfect reconstruction (PR), discrete Fourier transform (DFT) modulated oversampled filter banks (FB) for application in multi-carrier transceiver systems. The PR property is guaranteed by enforcing a paraunitary constraint on the polyphase matrix of the transmit or receive sub-systems. The desired polyphase matrix is obtained via embedding of lower dimensional paraunitary building blocks, each expressed in terms of a limited set of design parameters through a factorization based on Givens rotations. These parameters are adjusted to minimize the stop-band energy of the subband filters and thus improve their spectral containment. The performance of the proposed FB is investigated in a multi-carrier transceiver application, where it is compared with OFDM and other recently proposed FB structures. Numerical results show that the proposed approach can lead to significant reduction in the bit error rate (BER), as compared to the benchmark approaches, when used in the presence of narrowband interference or frequency offset.","startPage":"1588","endPage":"1592","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7069644/7069645/07073898.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7069645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Perfect reconstruction DFT modulated oversampled filter bank transceivers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"Perfect reconstruction DFT modulated oversampled filter bank transceivers","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7073898/","accessionNumber":"15034060","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073898/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Perfect reconstruction DFT modulated oversampled filter bank transceivers","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"1569421963.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056645S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"7069644","isNumber":"7069645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7069644","xplore-issue":"7069645","articleId":"7073898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7073910,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Waqar Aslam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, The University of Liverpool, Brownlow Hill, U.K."],"firstName":"Muhammad Waqar","lastName":"Aslam","id":"37949034900"},{"name":"Zhechen Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, The University of Liverpool, Brownlow Hill, U.K."],"firstName":"Zhechen","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37966491200"},{"name":"Asoke Kumar Nandi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, The University of Liverpool, Brownlow Hill, U.K."],"firstName":"Asoke Kumar","lastName":"Nandi","id":"37279678500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7073910","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Accuracy","Binary phase shift keying","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Genetic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio networks","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust QAM modulation classification","genetic programming","Fisher criterion","automatic modulation recognition","wireless communication","civilian application","military application","received signal modulation","received signal sampling","GP","QAM64","QAM16"]}],"abstract":"Automatic modulation recognition has seen increasing demand in recent years.

If the receiver front-end and analog-to-digital interface cannot respond to varying conditions, a high amount of nonlinear distortion is caused due to the clipping. This paper proposes a robust digital signal processing method to iteratively remove unintentional clipping distortion in OFDM receivers. Using computer simulations it is shown that the symbol error ratio of a heavily clipped signal in a fading channel situation can be reduced practically to the level of an equivalent non-clipped signal. In other words, the proposed method can remove all the essential clipping distortion.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073954/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15033858","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7073954/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Iterative signal processing for mitigation of wideband ADC nonidealities in cognitive radio receiver","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative signal processing for mitigation of wideband ADC nonidealities in cognitive radio receiver","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"1569423151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048457S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"7069644","isNumber":"7069645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7069644","xplore-issue":"7069645","articleId":"7073954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7073961,"authors":[{"name":"Giacomo Bacci","affiliation":["Inst.

For this class of channels, which we denote by L-interfering K-user MIMO IC, we provide a criterion applicable to symmetric systems for the system of IA equations to be proper, according to the framework introduced earlier by Yetis et al.

As the details usually are oriented in different directions and have different scales, the image processing leads to many convolution operations. The complex 2D matched filter (CMF) is an angle invariant line detection filter, which also provides additional information about orientation of detected lines. In this paper we follow the idea of complex matched filtering, and develop generalized complex matched filtering (GCMF) approach, which is a whole bank of different angle invariant filters, where each filter is denoted by the order. These filters can be used to detect a broader range of image details: edges, lines, line intersections and corners; and, like its predecessor, the GCMF provides additional information about the detected features - the orientation angle. Each kernel from the GCMF bank is analyzed in polar coordinates and the specifics of detail detection are explained. A method of generating GCMF normalized kernels of arbitrary order is proposed. GCMF algorithm is presented and its performance is demonstrated on test images.","publicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","startPage":"41","endPage":"45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7069645","pdfPath":"/iel7/7069644/7069645/07073981.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Feature extraction","Vectors","Equations","Convolution","Image edge detection","Harmonic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","feature extraction","image filtering","image processing","matched filters","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized complex 2D matched filtering","local regular line-like feature detection","pattern recognition system","special filter","image processing","convolution operation","line detection filter","GCMF bank","invariant filter","orientation angle","polar coordinate","GCMF normalized kernel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Generalized complex 2D matched filtering for local regular line-like feature detection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073981/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7073981/","accessionNumber":"15034032","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized complex 2D matched filtering for local regular line-like feature detection","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"1569423987.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053931S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"7069644","isNumber":"7069645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7069644","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7069645","articleId":"7073981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7073984,"authors":[{"name":"Nabil Romero-Zurita","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Nabil","lastName":"Romero-Zurita","id":"38293877800"},{"name":"Mounir Ghogho","affiliation":["International University of Rabat, Morocco","School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Mounir","lastName":"Ghogho","id":"37085561075"},{"name":"Des McLernon","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Des","lastName":"McLernon","id":"37085561544"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7073984","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","OFDM","Array signal processing","Antennas","Security","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","telecommunication security","telecommunication signalling","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physical layer security","MIMO frequency selective wireless channels","noise generation","MIMO communications","passive eavesdroppers","legitimate transmitter","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","spatial beamforming","artificial noise","frequency diversity","probabilistic analysis"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses physical layer security in MIMO communications over frequency selective wireless channels in the presence of passive eavesdroppers, i.e. the associated channels are unknown to the legitimate transmitter.

Confronted by drawbacks of time-domain and frequency-domain approaches, we propose a novel approach for source separation in subband-domain based on the pre-emphasis processing of subband signals. A time-domain algorithm based on the entropy maximization principle, using the natural gradient algorithm for adaptation task, is employed for subband signal separation. Instead of signal whitening based on frame-by-frame linear prediction analysis, we propose a fixed, pre-determined signal whitening scheme in the subbands to improve the separation performance while decreasing artifacts. With less computational complexity and side-effects, the proposed method is experimentally evaluated and shown to be superior to several other subband-based approaches.","publicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7069644/7069645/07073993.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7069645","startPage":"1874","endPage":"1878","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convolutive blind source separation based on GDFT filterbanks and pre-determined subband whitening","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073993","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Convolutive blind source separation based on GDFT filterbanks and pre-determined subband whitening","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7073993/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"15026578","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7073993/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convolutive blind source separation based on GDFT filterbanks and pre-determined subband whitening","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"1569424389.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077035S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"7069644","isNumber":"7069645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7069644","xplore-issue":"7069645","articleId":"7073993","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7073994,"authors":[{"name":"James E.

Firstly, a quarter-pel interpolator based on Horizontal-Vertical Expansion and Luma-Chroma Parallelism (HVE-LCP) is proposed to efficiently increase the throughput by at least 4 times from the previous designs. Secondly, a novel cache memory organization (4S\u00d74) is adopted to improve the on-chip memory utilization, contributing to memory area and power saving. Finally, a Split Task Queue (STQ) architecture enhances the memory system latency tolerance, which reduces overall processing time. This design costs a logic gate count and on-chip memory of 108.8k and 3.1kB, respectively.

Simulation results show the effectiveness of this approach in extracting the linear chirps and sinusoids from the noise and in eliminating the cross-terms from the Wigner distribution.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal separation in the Wigner distribution domain using fractional Fourier transform","publicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7069644/7069645/07074039.pdf","startPage":"1879","endPage":"1883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7069645","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7074039","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7074039/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"Signal separation in the Wigner distribution domain using fractional Fourier transform","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7074039/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"15033926","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal separation in the Wigner distribution domain using fractional Fourier transform","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"1569425255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083756S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"7069644","isNumber":"7069645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7069644","xplore-issue":"7069645","articleId":"7074039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7074043,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00e9 P.

The inherent sparsity present in the problem of location estimation motivates in a natural fashion the use of the recently introduced theory of compressive sensing (CS), which states that a signal having a sparse representation in an appropriate basis can be reconstructed with high accuracy from a small number of random linear projections. In the present work, we exploit the framework of CS to perform accurate indoor localization based on signal-strength measurements, while reducing significantly the amount of information transmitted from a wireless device with limited power, storage, and processing capabilities to a central server. Equally importantly, the inherent property of CS acting as a weak encryption process is demonstrated by showing that the proposed approach presents an increased robustness to potential intrusions of an unauthorized entity. The experimental evaluation reveals that the proposed CS-based localization technique is superior in terms of an increased localization accuracy in conjunction with a low computational complexity when compared with previous statistical fingerprint-based methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7069644/7069645/07074074.pdf","startPage":"1776","endPage":"1780","publicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7069645","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7074074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Indoor positioning in Wireless LANS using compressive sensing signal-strength fingerprints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Estimation","Runtime","Computer architecture","Training","Encryption","Microprocessors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bluetooth","compressed sensing","computer network security","cryptography","indoor navigation","signal representation","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor positioning","wireless LAN","compressive sensing signal-strength fingerprints","indoor localization","pervasive computing","ubiquitous computing","IEEE802.11","Bluetooth","infrared technology","ultrasound technology","location estimation","sparse signal representation","random linear projections","signal-strength measurements","wireless device","central server","weak encryption process","CS-based localization technique","low computational complexity","statistical fingerprint-based methods"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7074074/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"Indoor positioning in Wireless LANS using compressive sensing signal-strength fingerprints","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7074074/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"15034029","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Indoor positioning in Wireless LANS using compressive sensing signal-strength fingerprints","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"1569426057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114383S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"7069644","isNumber":"7069645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7069644","xplore-issue":"7069645","articleId":"7074074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7074081,"authors":[{"name":"Adri\u00e1n Agustin","affiliation":["Dept.

The duration of the relay-receive and the relay-transmit phases are fixed beforehand, so that the interference induced by other cells is stationary during a transmission interval. With the optimization of the precoders and powers allocated to the wireless backhaul (relay-receive phase) and to the RS-MS access (relay-transmit phase), it is possible to exploit the benefits of network-MIMO (N-MIMO) along with combating the pathloss and shadowing effects thanks to the RSs. Consequently, an appealing significant enhanced spectral efficiency, power efficiency and coverage homogeneity are obtained. Results are benchmarked to the case where the relay phases are optimized.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network MIMO for downlink in-band relay transmissions with relaying phases of fixed duration","publicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7069644/7069645/07074081.pdf","startPage":"1819","endPage":"1823","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7069645","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7074081","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7074081/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"Network MIMO for downlink in-band relay transmissions with relaying phases of fixed duration","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7074081/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"15033857","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network MIMO for downlink in-band relay transmissions with relaying phases of fixed duration","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"1569426095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068707S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"7069644","isNumber":"7069645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7069644","xplore-issue":"7069645","articleId":"7074081","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7074083,"authors":[{"name":"An\u0131l \u00c7elebi","affiliation":["Electronics & Telecom.

Low bit-depth representation based ME approaches provides an important alternative to reduce this computational load by making use of a lightweight and hardware efficient matching criteria. Constrained one-bit transform (C-1BT) based ME employs only two bit-planes and stands out its superior performance compared to other low bit-depth based ME approaches. Recently an adaptive search range determination algorithm is proposed to further speed-up C-1BT based ME. This paper presents novel hardware architecture for adaptive search range determination based ME method mentioned above. Proposed architecture implements spiral search method. No on-chip memory is needed neither for reference and nor for current macroblocks. Thus, there is no need to design a complex memory hierarchy and control logic to implement the spiral search method. A data reuse scheme among adjacent search windows is utilised with thanks to two axis rotatable two dimensional shift register architecture. Thus, a very low off-chip memory bandwidth can be achieved.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High performance hardware architecture for constrained one-bit transform based motion estimation","publicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7069644/7069645/07074083.pdf","startPage":"2151","endPage":"2155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7069645","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7074083","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7074083/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"High performance hardware architecture for constrained one-bit transform based motion estimation","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7074083/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"15026574","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High performance hardware architecture for constrained one-bit transform based motion estimation","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"1569426109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057758S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"7069644","isNumber":"7069645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7069644","xplore-issue":"7069645","articleId":"7074083","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7074090,"authors":[{"name":"H.-N.

The main challenges of BSS in realistic environments are: sources are moving in complex motions and the room impulse responses are long. For moving sources the unmixing filters to separate the audio signals are difficult to calculate from only statistical information available from a limited number of audio samples. For physically stationary sources measured in rooms with long impulse responses, the performance of audio only BSS methods is limited. Therefore, visual modality is utilized to facilitate the separation. The movement of the sources is detected with a 3-D tracker based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo particle filter (MCMC-PF), and the direction of arrival information of the sources to the microphone array is estimated. A robust least squares frequency invariant data independent (RLSFIDI) beamformer is implemented to perform real time speech enhancement. The uncertainties in source localization and direction of arrival information are also controlled by using a convex optimization approach in the beamformer design. A 16 element circular array configuration is used. Simulation studies based on objective and subjective measures confirm the advantage of beamforming based processing over conventional BSS methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7074125/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15034018","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7074125/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multimodal blind source separation with a circular microphone array and robust beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multimodal blind source separation with a circular microphone array and robust beamforming","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"1569426683.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057698S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"7069644","isNumber":"7069645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7069644","xplore-issue":"7069645","articleId":"7074125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7074131,"authors":[{"name":"Edwin Mabande","affiliation":["University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Edwin","lastName":"Mabande","id":"37645329100"},{"name":"Haohai Sun","affiliation":["Dept. of Elec. and Telecom., Acoustics Research Center, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Haohai","lastName":"Sun","id":"37403469800"},{"name":"Konrad Kowalczyk","affiliation":["University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Konrad","lastName":"Kowalczyk","id":"37411428500"},{"name":"Walter Kellermann","affiliation":["University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Walter","lastName":"Kellermann","id":"37274601000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7074131","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":152},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7074131","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Acoustics","Microphones","Smoothing methods","Direction-of-arrival estimation","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","array signal processing","microphone arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["steered beamformer-based reflection localization methods","subspace-based reflection localization methods","acoustic environment","EB-ESPRIT method","EB-MUSIC method","EB-minimum variance distortionless response method","EB-MVDR method","direction of arrival estimation","sound sources","reflective surfaces","acoustic images","microphone array"]}],"publicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7069644/7069645/07074131.pdf","startPage":"146","endPage":"150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7069645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of subspace-based and steered beamformer-based reflection localization methods","abstract":"This paper presents a comparative study of several techniques that are applicable to the localization of the most significant reflectors in an acoustic environment.

Vector precoding (VP) techniques have shown very promising performance results, but the perturbation process inherent in these type of non-linear systems hinders their efficient implementation. The key to achieving a high-throughput VP implementation is to operate directly on the complex-valued constellations. Nevertheless, the complex-plane Schnorr-Euchner enumerators present in the literature follow a sequential scheme, which derives in an increased system delay and high resource demand in fully-pipelined architectures. This paper presents the first non-sequential complex Schnorr-Euchner enumerator for the precoding scenario. The proposed complex enumerator has been implemented and analyzed along with other state-of-the-art enumeration algorithms. Provided hardware occupation and latency results show that the proposed enumeration algorithm is superior to other existing schemes in terms of hardware resource usage and throughput.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7069644/7069645/07074134.pdf","startPage":"739","endPage":"743","publicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7069645","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7074134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of complex enumeration for multiuser MIMO vector precoding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lattices","Vectors","MIMO","Hardware","Delays","Sorting","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast communication","MIMO communication","nonlinear systems","perturbation techniques","precoding","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex enumeration","multiuser MIMO vector precoding","multiple-input multiple-output broadcast channel","vector precoding techniques","perturbation process","nonlinear systems","complex-valued constellations","complex-plane Schnorr-Euchner enumerators","system delay","precoding scenario","hardware resource usage","multiuser MIMO broadcast channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7074134/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of complex enumeration for multiuser MIMO vector precoding","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7074134/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"15033936","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of complex enumeration for multiuser MIMO vector precoding","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"1569426765.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083309S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"7069644","isNumber":"7069645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7069644","xplore-issue":"7069645","articleId":"7074134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7074136,"authors":[{"name":"Lukas Bolliger","affiliation":["ETH Zurich Dept. of Information Technology & Electr.

Experimental results on raw AVIRIS and AIRS images show that the proposed technique yields a very large reduction of mean-squared error with respect to conventional reconstruction methods.","publicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7069644/7069645/07074140.pdf","startPage":"1120","endPage":"1124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7069645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compressive sampling scheme for iterative hyperspectral image reconstruction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7074140","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7074140/","displayDocTitle":"A compressive sampling scheme for iterative hyperspectral image reconstruction","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"15033890","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7074140/","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compressive sampling scheme for iterative hyperspectral image reconstruction","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"1569426823.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045911S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"7069644","isNumber":"7069645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7069644","xplore-issue":"7069645","articleId":"7074140","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7074141,"authors":[{"name":"Ubaid Ahmad","affiliation":["Interuniversity Micro-Electronics Center (IMEC) vzw, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Ubaid","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"37587803700"},{"name":"Min Li","affiliation":["Interuniversity Micro-Electronics Center (IMEC) vzw, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Li","id":"37291655700"},{"name":"Sofie Pollin","affiliation":["Interuniversity Micro-Electronics Center (IMEC) vzw, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Sofie","lastName":"Pollin","id":"37271990100"},{"name":"Amir Amin","affiliation":["Interuniversity Micro-Electronics Center (IMEC) vzw, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Amin","id":"37587414400"},{"name":"Liesbet Van der Perre","affiliation":["Interuniversity Micro-Electronics Center (IMEC) vzw, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Liesbet","lastName":"Van der Perre","id":"37271995400"},{"name":"Rudy Lauwereins","affiliation":["Interuniversity Micro-Electronics Center (IMEC) vzw, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Rudy","lastName":"Lauwereins","id":"37266921700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7074141","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":64},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7074141","abstract":"Lattice Reduction (LR) is a promising technique to improve the performance of linear MIMO detectors. This paper proposes a Hybrid LR algorithm (HLR), which is a scalable LR algorithm. HLR is specifically designed and optimised to exploit ILP and DLP features offered by parallel programmable baseband architectures. Abundant vector-parallelism in HLR is enabled with highly-regular and deterministic data-flow. Hence, HLR can be easily parallelized and efficiently mapped on Software Defined Radio (SDR) baseband architectures. HLR can be adapted to operate in two different modes to achieve the best performance/cycle trade-off, which is highly desirable for SDR baseband processing. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated in the context of 3GPP-LTE and implemented on ADRES which is a Coarse Grain Reconfigurable Array (CGRA) processor. Most of the previously reported implementations of LR algorithms are for ASIC or FPGA. However, to the best of author's knowledge, this is the first reported LR algorithm explicitly designed and optimized, to have a scalable and adaptive implementation for a CGRA processor like ADRES. The reported implementation of HLR can achieve gains of up to 12 dB compared to ZF for MIMO detection.","startPage":"91","endPage":"95","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7069644/7069645/07074141.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7069645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid lattice reduction algorithm and its implementation on an SDR baseband processor for LTE","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Lattices","Algorithm design and analysis","Bit error rate","Signal processing algorithms","Complexity theory","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lattice theory","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid lattice reduction algorithm","SDR baseband processor","LTE","linear MIMO detectors","hybrid LR algorithm","HLR","parallel programmable baseband architectures","abundant vector-parallelism","deterministic data-flow","highly-regular data-flow","software defined radio baseband architectures","3GPP-LTE","coarse grain reconfigurable array processor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7074141/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid lattice reduction algorithm and its implementation on an SDR baseband processor for LTE","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7074141/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"15026568","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid lattice reduction algorithm and its implementation on an SDR baseband processor for LTE","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"1569426851.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056039S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"7069644","isNumber":"7069645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7069644","xplore-issue":"7069645","articleId":"7074141","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7074143,"authors":[{"name":"Cristian Stanciu","affiliation":["Telecommunications Department, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Stanciu","id":"37546640700"},{"name":"Cristian Anghel","affiliation":["Telecommunications Department, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Anghel","id":"37678895800"},{"name":"Constantin Paleologu","affiliation":["Telecommunications Department, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Constantin","lastName":"Paleologu","id":"37304184600"},{"name":"Jacob Benesty","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, University of Quebec, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Jacob","lastName":"Benesty","id":"37274630700"},{"name":"Felix Albu","affiliation":["Telecommunications Department, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Felix","lastName":"Albu","id":"37270884100"},{"name":"Silviu Ciochin\u0103","affiliation":["Universitatea din Bucuresti, Bucuresti, RO"],"firstName":"Silviu","lastName":"Ciochin\u0103"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7074143","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"abstract":"This paper presents a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation of a low-complexity proportionate affine projection algorithm (PAPA), in the context of echo cancellation.

The MIPAPA takes into account the \u201chistory\u201d of the proportionate factors, which is not the case for the classical PAPAs. Moreover, it achieves a lower computational complexity due to a recursive implementation of the \u201cproportionate history;\u201d as a consequence, the matrix that has to be inverted within the MIPAPA has the time-shift property, which can also lower the complexity. Concerning this task, the DCD technique efficiently performs the matrix inversion, requiring only addition operations. The proposed hardware implementation scheme takes advantage of the algorithm's specific features. The overall performance of the proposed DCD-MIPAPA indicates that it can be a reliable choice for real-world echo cancellation scenarios.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7069644/7069645/07074143.pdf","startPage":"1284","endPage":"1288","publicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7069645","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7074143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of an efficient proportionate affine projection algorithm for echo cancellation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Echo cancellers","Clocks","Vectors","Speech","Field programmable gate arrays","Signal processing algorithms","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","echo suppression","field programmable gate arrays","matrix inversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","echo cancellation","field-programmable gate array","low-complexity proportionate affine projection algorithm","memory-improved PAPA","MIPAPA","dichotomous coordinate descent method","computational complexity","time-shift property","DCD technique","matrix inversion","hardware implementation scheme"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7074143/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of an efficient proportionate affine projection algorithm for echo cancellation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7074143/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"15033945","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of an efficient proportionate affine projection algorithm for echo cancellation","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"1569426855.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066227S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"7069644","isNumber":"7069645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7069644","xplore-issue":"7069645","articleId":"7074143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7074147,"authors":[{"name":"Emanu\u00ebl A.

The main focus is on the single user case where the IAI between the MIMO streams needs to be addressed.

Collaborative transmission beamforming (CTB) saves energy consumed by each node by distributing between different WSN nodes the required total power transmission to get a desired bit error rate (BER) at the receiver. Moreover, by coherently combining the different signals transmitted by the WSN nodes, CTB increases the signal strength in the direction of the receiver, therefore decreases the total power transmission of the WSN. In this paper, we propose a new CTB technique that minimizes the total power transmission of the WSN while balancing the residual energy in different nodes. By solving this multi-objective optimization problem, we show that the WSN lifetime can be improved up to 30 % compared to the basic CTB algorithm, which aims at minimizing the total power transmission without taking into account the residual energy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7074193/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15026615","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7074193/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Residual energy-aware collaborative transmission beamforming in wireless sensor networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Residual energy-aware collaborative transmission beamforming in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"1569427199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055513S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"7069644","isNumber":"7069645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7069644","xplore-issue":"7069645","articleId":"7074193","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7074200,"authors":[{"name":"Nima Sarmadi","affiliation":["Communication Systems Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Nima","lastName":"Sarmadi","id":"37860595600"},{"name":"Marius Pesavento","affiliation":["Communication Systems Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Marius","lastName":"Pesavento","id":"37085570027"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7074200","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":20},"abstract":"In this paper, the problem of blind subspace-based channel estimation in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems under orthogonal space-time block coded (OSTBC) transmission is investigated.

We show that the vector of true channel parameters is scaled version of the normalized principal eigenvector of the associated augmented data covariance matrix, which in the case of rotatable OSTBCs is not unique. We propose a simple weighting of the different virtual snapshots in the computation of a modified covariance matrix and derive general conditions that guarantee uniqueness of the channel estimates from the principal eigenvector of that matrix. Further, we prove that the blind estimation schemes of [8] and [9] can be viewed as a particular examples satisfying these uniqueness conditions. In previous works, the uniqueness of these schemes has only been concluded from simulation results but it has not been proven analytically before.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7069644/7069645/07074200.pdf","startPage":"644","endPage":"648","publicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7069645","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7074200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closed-form blind mimo channel estimation for OSTBCS: Resolving ambiguities in rotatable codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Covariance matrices","Channel estimation","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","MIMO","Indexes","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","covariance matrices","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","MIMO communication","orthogonal codes","redundancy","space-time block codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind subspace MIMO channel estimation","OSTBCS","rotatable code","multiple input multiple output system","orthogonal space-time block coded transmission","virtual snapshot model","principal eigenvector","data covariance matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["blind MIMO channel estimation","OSTBC","covariance matching","uniqueness conditions","subspace model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7074200/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"Closed-form blind mimo channel estimation for OSTBCS: Resolving ambiguities in rotatable codes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7074200/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"15033811","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed-form blind mimo channel estimation for OSTBCS: Resolving ambiguities in rotatable codes","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"1569427261.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048121S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"7069644","isNumber":"7069645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7069644","xplore-issue":"7069645","articleId":"7074200","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7074207,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Hui Chen","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Hui Chen","id":"37635132500"},{"name":"Carrson C.

It suffers, however, from an inherent (intrinsic) imaginary intercarrier/inter-symbol interference that complicates signal processing tasks such as channel estimation (CE). Recently, the so-called interference approximation method (IAM) was proposed for preamble-based CE. It relies on the knowledge of the pilot's neighborhood to approximate this interference and constructively exploit it in simplifying CE and improving its performance. The IAM preamble with nulls at the neighboring time instants that results in optimum CE performance was recently reported. This paper investigates an extended version of it, which can provide significant improvement through an appropriate exploitation of the interfering symbols from neighboring time instants as well. Simulation results are presented that compare the methods, with each other and with CP-OFDM, in both mildly and highly frequencyselective channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7069644/7069645/07074274.pdf","startPage":"1603","endPage":"1607","publicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7069645","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7074274","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved interference approximation method for preamble-based channel estimation in FBMC/OQAM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Interference","Channel estimation","Noise","Approximation methods","Modulation","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","channel estimation","Doppler shift","intercarrier interference","intersymbol interference","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved interference approximation method","preamble-based channel estimation","FBMC","OQAM","filter bank-based multicarrier modulation","offset quadrature amplitude modulation","cyclic prefix-based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","frequency offset","Doppler spread","inherent imaginary intercarrier interference","inherent imaginary intersymbol interference","IAM","preamble-based CE","CP-OFDM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7074274/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"Improved interference approximation method for preamble-based channel estimation in FBMC/OQAM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7074274/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"15033772","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved interference approximation method for preamble-based channel estimation in FBMC/OQAM","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"1569427855.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067565S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"7069644","isNumber":"7069645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7069644","xplore-issue":"7069645","articleId":"7074274","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7074277,"authors":[{"name":"Vassilis Kekatos","affiliation":["ECE Dept., University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Vassilis","lastName":"Kekatos","id":"37294360600"},{"name":"Georgios B.

They are both critically challenged by the curse of dimensionality, which is typically alleviated via kernel regression. However, exciting diverse applications ranging from neuroscience to genome-wide association (GWA) analysis call for parsimonious polynomial expansions of critical interpretative value. Unfortunately, kernel regression cannot yield sparsity in the primal domain, where compressed sampling approaches can offer a viable alternative. Following the compressed sampling principle, a sparse polynomial expansion can be recovered by far fewer measurements compared to the least squares (LS)-based approaches. But how many measurements are sufficient for a given level of sparsity? This paper is the first attempt to answer this question by analyzing the restricted isometry properties for commonly met polynomial regression settings. Additionally, the merits of compressed sampling approaches to polynomial modeling are corroborated on synthetic and real data for quantitative genotype-phenotype analysis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing for volterra and polynomial regression models","publicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7069644/7069645/07074277.pdf","startPage":"373","endPage":"377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7069645","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7074277","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7074277/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing for volterra and polynomial regression models","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7074277/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"15034004","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing for volterra and polynomial regression models","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"1569427897.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068077S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"7069644","isNumber":"7069645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7069644","xplore-issue":"7069645","articleId":"7074277","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7074280,"authors":[{"name":"Felip Riera-Palou","affiliation":["Universitat de les Illes Balears, Palma de Mallorca, Illes Balears, ES"],"firstName":"Felip","lastName":"Riera-Palou"},{"name":"Guillem Femenias","affiliation":["Dept. of Mathematics and Informatics, University of the Balearic Islands, Mallorca, Illes Balears, Spain"],"firstName":"Guillem","lastName":"Femenias","id":"37266545400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7074280","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"abstract":"This paper proposes a novel receiver structure based on soft information for linearly precoded MIMO-OFDM systems.

Firstly, it can fully exploit the diversity benefits of spreading the information symbols in the space and frequency domains by optimally estimating them. Secondly, and under the realistic assumption of the presence of a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) mechanism, the far more computationally demanding MLD component needs only be used when the MMSE front end has failed. Simulation results reveal that the MLD iterative mechanism adds only a negligible amount of computations to the simple MMSE detector while significantly improving its performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7069644/7069645/07074280.pdf","startPage":"1628","endPage":"1632","publicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7069645","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7074280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CRC-aided iterative optimal detection for MIMO-OFDM systems with linear precoding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","OFDM","Detectors","Modulation","Vectors","Computer architecture","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic redundancy check codes","frequency-domain analysis","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","linear codes","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","precoding","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","MLD iterative mechanism","MMSE front end technique","cyclic redundancy check mechanism","space domain","frequency domain","maximum likelihood detection","CRC-aided iterative optimal detection","MIMO-OFDM receiver structure","linear precoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7074280/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"CRC-aided iterative optimal detection for MIMO-OFDM systems with linear precoding","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7074280/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"15033755","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CRC-aided iterative optimal detection for MIMO-OFDM systems with linear precoding","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"1569427991.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051683S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"7069644","isNumber":"7069645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7069644","xplore-issue":"7069645","articleId":"7074280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7074282,"authors":[{"name":"Waleed Al-Hanafy","affiliation":["Electronics and Commun.

This feature leads semi-blind channel estimation performance to exceed that of the schemes based on the blind part or the training sequence only. Moreover, in some situations they can estimate the channel when the other techniques fail. Semi-blind channel estimation techniques were developed and usually evaluated for a given channel realization, i.e. with a deterministic channel model. On the other hand, in wireless communications the channel is typically modeled as Rayleigh fading, i.e. with a Gaussian (prior) distribution expressing variances of and correlations between channel coefficients. In recent years, such prior information on the channel has started to get exploited in pilot-based channel estimation, since often the pure pilot-based (deterministic) channel estimate is of limited quality due to limited pilots. In this paper we provide a performance comparison between ML/MAP algorithms that use Bayesian and deterministic approaches in semi-blind channel estimation.","publicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7069644/7069645/07074296.pdf","startPage":"2219","endPage":"2223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7069645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A performance of Bayesian semi-blind FIR channel estimation algorithms in SIMO systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7074296/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"A performance of Bayesian semi-blind FIR channel estimation algorithms in SIMO systems","htmlLink":"/document/7074296/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","accessionNumber":"15026609","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A performance of Bayesian semi-blind FIR channel estimation algorithms in SIMO systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"1569428523.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077551S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"7069644","isNumber":"7069645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7069644","xplore-issue":"7069645","articleId":"7074296","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7074300,"authors":[{"name":"Zhihua Lu","affiliation":["Signal Processing Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Merckstrasse 25, Darmstadt, Germany"],"lastName":"Zhihua Lu","id":"37087595699"},{"name":"Abdelhak M.

Interior point method (IPM) and active set method (ASM) are the most commonly employed approaches for solving general QP problems. This paper compares several performance aspects of the two methods when they are implemented on a FPGA for MPC applications. We compare the computational complexity, storage, convergence speed, and some practical implementation issues. We find that, in general, ASM gives lower complexity and converges faster when the numbers of decision variables and constraints are small. Otherwise, IPM should be a better choice due to its scalability. We also note occasional instability of both IPM and ASM when they are implemented in our FPGA, which uses single precision floating point arithmetic. The instability is mainly due to numerical error, which is found to be more serious in ASM than IPM in our current implementations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of interior point and active set methods for FPGA implementation of model predictive control","publicationTitle":"2009 European Control Conference (ECC)","doi":"10.23919/ECC.2009.7074396","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Control Conference (ECC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7069760/7069761/07074396.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ECC.2009.7074396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7069761","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7074396","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7074396/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of interior point and active set methods for FPGA implementation of model predictive control","conferenceDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7074396/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"15034218","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of interior point and active set methods for FPGA implementation of model predictive control","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"0240744.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053323S","chronDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"7069760","isNumber":"7069761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7069760","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7069761","articleId":"7074396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUCA","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7074401,"authors":[{"name":"Christos A.

Honoring SLAs is a multi-faceted problem that may involve optimal use of the available resources, optimization of the system's performance and availability or maximization of the provider's revenue and it poses a significant challenge for researchers and system administrators due to the volatile, huge and unpredictable Web environments where these computing systems reside. The use of algorithms possessing run-time adaptation features, such as dynamic resource allocation, admission control and optimization becomes an absolute must. As a continuation of the recent successful application of control theory concepts and methods to the computing systems area, our survey indicates that the problem of honoring SLAs on cloud computing services is a new interesting application for control theory and that researchers can benefit significantly from a number of well-known modern control methodologies, such as hybrid, supervisory, hierarchical and model predictive control.","publicationTitle":"2009 European Control Conference (ECC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Control Conference (ECC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7069760/7069761/07074401.pdf","startPage":"184","endPage":"189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Honoring SLAs on cloud computing services: A control perspective","doi":"10.23919/ECC.2009.7074401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7069761","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ECC.2009.7074401","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7074401","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7074401/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Honoring SLAs on cloud computing services: A control perspective","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"15034406","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/7074401/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Honoring SLAs on cloud computing services: A control perspective","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"0290570.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077712S","chronDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"7069760","isNumber":"7069761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7069760","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7069761","articleId":"7074401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUCA","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7074413,"authors":[{"name":"Filippo Cacace","affiliation":["Universit\u00e0 Campus Bio-Medico di Roma, Via \u00c0 lvaro del Portillo, 21, 00128 - Italy"],"firstName":"Filippo","lastName":"Cacace","id":"37269140200"},{"name":"Alfredo Germani","affiliation":["Roma, Italy","Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica e dell'Informazione, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi dell' Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy"],"firstName":"Alfredo","lastName":"Germani","id":"37274965300"},{"name":"Costanzo Manes","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica e dell'Informazione, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi dell' Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy"],"firstName":"Costanzo","lastName":"Manes","id":"37274963500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-9524173-9-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7074413","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":32},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Intellectual property","Stability analysis","MIMO","Vectors","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebra","discrete time systems","filtering theory","linear systems","MIMO systems","nonlinear control systems","polynomial approximation","stability","state-space methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polynomial MIMO systems","positive state space realizations","signal processing algorithms","control laws","a priori positivity constraint","design limitation","general stationary linear filters","internally positive realization","IPR problem","positive filters","discrete-time single-input-single-output linear systems","multiinput-multioutput linear systems","Kronecker algebra","nonlinear systems","local stability properties"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7074413","abstract":"In several technological frameworks only positive state space realizations of signal processing algorithms (filters or control laws) can be implemented. On the other hand, the imposition of an a priori positivity constraint on the processing algorithm is a too strong design limitation. For this reason, many authors studied the problem of state-space realization of general stationary linear filters through an Internally Positive Realization (IPR), such as a combination of positive filters. The IPR problem for discrete-time single-input/single-output (SISO) linear systems has been widely investigated, and important results are available in the literature. Recently, theoretical contributions to the IPR problem for multi-input/multi-output (MIMO) linear systems case have also appeared. The IPR of nonlinear systems has been never investigated. In this paper the IPR problem of polynomial MIMO systems and filters is formulated and a straightforward method, based on the Kronecker algebra, for the construction of IPR's is proposed. The local stability properties of the resulting positive realization are also investigated. The importance of this work lies in the fact that the behavior of any nonlinear system can be well approximated through polynomial systems.","doi":"10.23919/ECC.2009.7074413","pdfPath":"/iel7/7069760/7069761/07074413.pdf","startPage":"254","endPage":"259","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Control Conference (ECC)","publicationTitle":"2009 European Control Conference (ECC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ECC.2009.7074413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7069761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Representation on a class of polynomial MIMO systems via positive realizations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7074413/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Representation on a class of polynomial MIMO systems via positive realizations","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","accessionNumber":"15034542","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/7074413/","conferenceDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Representation on a class of polynomial MIMO systems via positive realizations","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"0410100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056313S","chronDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"7069760","isNumber":"7069761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7069760","xplore-issue":"7069761","articleId":"7074413","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUCA","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7074460,"authors":[{"name":"Bartek Roszak","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Bartek","lastName":"Roszak","id":"37569884100"},{"name":"Edward J.

Here, the neuro-fuzzy system FasArt (Fuzzy Adaptive System ART based) is used to obtain rule-based fuzzy models, as shown in previous papers and works. FasArt, however, has the usual drawbacks, from the linguistic point of view, of most (precise) fuzzy modeling methods found in the literature, so any other fuzzy modeling algorithm can be used. Then, an improvement process is carried out based on a multi-objective genetic approach, in which interpretability and accuracy are taken into account. Two case studies have been considered: a DC motor and the Box-Jenkins gas furnace data. For each one, two fuzzy models with different complexity and fuzzy nature are generated by FasArt, whose performance is a good estimation of their behavior. Then this performance is improved by a better interpretability of the knowledge attained and stored by this fuzzy model. This is carried out by a two objectives genetic approach, in which accuracy and interpretability are taken into account. It is thus possible to find a fuzzy model with enough accuracy and an adequate capacity of explanation or interpretability of knowledge acquired from data.","doi":"10.23919/ECC.2009.7075011","startPage":"3915","endPage":"3920","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Control Conference (ECC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7069760/7069761/07075011.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 European Control Conference (ECC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ECC.2009.7075011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7069761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accuracy-interpretability balancing in fuzzy models based on multiobjective genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","Redundancy","Adaptation models","Computational modeling","Genetic algorithms","Data models","Fuzzy logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive systems","ART neural nets","fuzzy control","fuzzy neural nets","genetic algorithms","neurocontrollers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge interpretability","Box-Jenkins gas furnace data","DC motor","multiobjective genetic approach","fuzzy modeling methods","fuzzy adaptive system ART","neuro-fuzzy system FasArt","rule-based fuzzy model","linguistic-accuracy trade-off","multiobjective genetic algorithm","accuracy-interpretability balancing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7075011/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Accuracy-interpretability balancing in fuzzy models based on multiobjective genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"15034665","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accuracy-interpretability balancing in fuzzy models based on multiobjective genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"6390403.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039584S","chronDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","isNumber":"7069761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7069760","articleId":"7075011","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":7075187,"authors":[{"name":"Laszlo Techy","affiliation":["Department of Aerospace & Ocean Engineering, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA"],"firstName":"Laszlo","lastName":"Techy","id":"37542902000"},{"name":"Derek A.

The periodic flight pattern of the UAVs is divided into a semi-circular sampling path and a near-minimum-time re-initialization path. To ensure consistent measurements, the vehicles coordinate their motion to arrive at the beginning of the sampling arcs simultaneously.","doi":"10.23919/ECC.2009.7075187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ECC.2009.7075187","startPage":"4967","endPage":"4972","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Control Conference (ECC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7069760/7069761/07075187.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 European Control Conference (ECC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7069761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UAV coordination on convex curves in wind: An environmental sampling application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"UAV coordination on convex curves in wind: An environmental sampling application","conferenceDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7075187/","accessionNumber":"15034465","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7075187/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UAV coordination on convex curves in wind: An environmental sampling application","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"8150709.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042601S","chronDate":"23-26 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"7069760","isNumber":"7069761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7069760","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7069761","articleId":"7075187","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUCA","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7075924,"authors":[{"name":"M.

To motivate, two examples are given in which instability occurs due to variations in sampling time. Two possible solutions are presented to guarantee stability. In the first method restrictions on the scheduling strategy are opposed, which allow immediate switching from fast to slow sampling but require to stay for at least a minimum time with slow sampling before switching back to fast sampling again. The second method suggests an optimal controller design in which a bound on the cost, for all possible scheduling strategies, is computed. This results in a piecewise constant state feedback control law and guarantees stability regardless of scheduling.","doi":"10.23919/ECC.2001.7075978","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ECC.2001.7075978","startPage":"624","endPage":"628","displayPublicationTitle":"2001 European Control Conference (ECC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7075845/7075846/07075978.pdf","publicationTitle":"2001 European Control Conference (ECC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7075846","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sample data control with varyingsampling time","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Sept. 2001","displayDocTitle":"Sample data control with varyingsampling time","conferenceDate":"4-7 Sept. 2001","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2001","dateOfInsertion":"27 April 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7075978/","accessionNumber":"15091084","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7075978/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sample data control with varyingsampling time","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"0624.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03707S","chronDate":"4-7 Sept. 2001","xplore-pub-id":"7075845","isNumber":"7075846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7075845","xplore-issue":"7075846","articleId":"7075978","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2001","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUCA","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7076127,"authors":[{"name":"Haldun M.

In the warped (discrete) time scale the system structure is particularly simple, allowing control laws not to be misleaded by unnatural complications. An apllication is performed to adaptive control of temperature in a distributed collector solar field. Experimental results are presented in which large set-point changes are performed resulting in fast temperature transitions with very small overshoot.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Legged locomotion","Temperature measurement","Europe","Temperature control","Aerospace electronics","Adaptation models","Mirrors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","approximation theory","distributed parameter systems","group theory","process control","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","transport systems","nonuniform sampling","distributed parameter plants","mass transport","energy transport","Trotter formula","approximate semigroup decomposition","varying sampling period"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design methodologies","Variable sampling","Process control","Distributed parameter","Adaptive control"]}],"doi":"10.23919/ECC.2001.7076178","publicationTitle":"2001 European Control Conference (ECC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2001 European Control Conference (ECC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7075845/7075846/07076178.pdf","startPage":"1774","endPage":"1779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7075846","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ECC.2001.7076178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive control of transport systems with non-uniform sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7076178","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive control of transport systems with non-uniform sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7076178/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2001","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7076178/","accessionNumber":"15091182","conferenceDate":"4-7 Sept. 2001","dateOfInsertion":"27 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Sept. 2001","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive control of transport systems with non-uniform sampling","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"1774.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040651S","chronDate":"4-7 Sept. 2001","xplore-pub-id":"7075845","isNumber":"7075846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7075845","xplore-issue":"7075846","articleId":"7076178","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2001","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUCA","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7076181,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The basic problem formulation is to have the vehicles move from an initial dynamic state to a final state without colliding with each other, while at the same time avoiding other stationary and moving obstacles. It is shown that this problem can be rewritten as a linear program with mixed integer/linear constraints that account for the collision avoidance. A key benefit of this approach is that the path optimization can be readily solved using the CPLEX optimization software with an AMPL/Matlab interface. An example is worked out to show that the framework of mixed integer/linear programming is well suited for path planning and collision avoidance problems. Implementation issues are also considered. In particular, we compare receding horizon strategies with fixed arrival time approaches.","doi":"10.23919/ECC.2001.7076321","publicationTitle":"2001 European Control Conference (ECC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2001 European Control Conference (ECC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7075845/7075846/07076321.pdf","startPage":"2603","endPage":"2608","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ECC.2001.7076321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7075846","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mixed integer programming for multi-vehicle path planning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7076321","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Sept. 2001","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7076321/","displayDocTitle":"Mixed integer programming for multi-vehicle path planning","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2001","accessionNumber":"15090596","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7076321/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Sept. 2001","dateOfInsertion":"27 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mixed integer programming for multi-vehicle path planning","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"2603.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067132S","chronDate":"4-7 Sept. 2001","xplore-pub-id":"7075845","isNumber":"7075846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7075845","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"7075846","articleId":"7076321","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2001","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUCA","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7076488,"authors":[{"name":"Bruno Maione","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettrotecnica ed Elettronica, Politecnico di Bari, Bari, Italy"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Maione","id":"37326707800"},{"name":"David Naso","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettrotecnica ed Elettronica, Politecnico di Bari, Bari, Italy"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Naso","id":"37267751300"},{"name":"Biagio Turchiano","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettrotecnica ed Elettronica, Politecnico di Bari, Bari, Italy"],"firstName":"Biagio","lastName":"Turchiano","id":"37267751000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-9524173-6-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7076488","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":26},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7076488","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Biological cells","Encoding","Convergence","Sociology","Statistics","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","discrete time systems","genetic algorithms","identification","linear systems","poles and zeros","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GARA","genetic algorithm with resolution adaptation","system identification problems","genetic search","local hill climbing method","search space binary representation","population convergence","heuristic strategy","delay estimation","poles and zeros","discrete time linear systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Identification for Control","Identification Methods","Genetic Algorithms"]}],"doi":"10.23919/ECC.2001.7076488","pdfPath":"/iel7/7075845/7075846/07076488.pdf","publicationTitle":"2001 European Control Conference (ECC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2001 European Control Conference (ECC)","startPage":"3570","endPage":"3575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7075846","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ECC.2001.7076488","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GARA: A genetic algorithm with resolution adaptation for solving system identification problems","abstract":"This paper describes a Genetic Algorithm with Resolution Adaptation (GARA) used to solve System Identification (SI) problems. The algorithm is both hybrid, because it combines the genetic search with a fast local hill climbing method to improve the speed of convergence, and adaptive, because it uses information on the actual convergence of the population to modify the resolution of the binary representation of the search space. In particular, we introduce a new index of convergence of the population, which offers an effective estimate of the convergence with a small computation charge. When the convergence is reached, a heuristic strategy reinitializes the GA to obtain solutions that iteratively approach the global optimum with increasing speed and accuracy. In a set of case studies, GARA is used to estimate delays, gains, poles and zeros of discrete time linear systems, providing performances considerably better than other GAs previously used in SI problems. The reliability and the accuracy of GARA make it an interesting alternative to other conventional SI algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Sept. 2001","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7076488/","accessionNumber":"15090826","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7076488/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2001","dateOfInsertion":"27 April 2015","conferenceDate":"4-7 Sept. 2001","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"GARA: A genetic algorithm with resolution adaptation for solving system identification problems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GARA: A genetic algorithm with resolution adaptation for solving system identification problems","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"3570.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074945S","chronDate":"4-7 Sept. 2001","xplore-pub-id":"7075845","isNumber":"7075846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7075845","xplore-issue":"7075846","articleId":"7076488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2001","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUCA","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7076541,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel Ayala Botto","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Miguel Ayala","lastName":"Botto","id":"37352080800"},{"name":"Ton J.J. van den Boom","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology & Systems, Delft University of Technology, Delft, GA, the Netherlands"],"firstName":"Ton J.J.","lastName":"van den Boom","id":"37086209716"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Sa da Costa","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Jos\u00e9","lastName":"Sa da Costa","id":"38182027000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-9524173-6-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7076541","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7076541","abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of stability robustness of minimum-phase nonlinear dynamical systems modeled with feedforward neural networks with bounded parametric uncertainties under IOF linearization.

The algorithm comprises 4 parts: (1) Criteria of rules generation; (2) Allocation of premise parameters; (3) Determination of consequent parameters and (4) Pruning technology. The salient characteristics of the approach are: (1) A hierarchical on-line self-organizing learning paradigm is employed so that not only parameters can be adjusted, but also the determination of structure can be self-adaptive without partitioning the input space a priori; (2) Fast learning speed can be achieved so that the system can be implemented in real time. The application of the proposed approach is demonstrated in application to a demanding, highly nonlinear, missile control design task. Scheduling on instantaneous incidence (a rapidly varying quantity) is well known to lead to considerable difficulties with classical gain-scheduling methods. It is shown that the methods proposed here can, however, be used to successfully design an effective intelligent controller.","doi":"10.23919/ECC.2001.7076545","startPage":"3911","endPage":"3916","publicationTitle":"2001 European Control Conference (ECC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ECC.2001.7076545","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7075846","displayPublicationTitle":"2001 European Control Conference (ECC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7075845/7075846/07076545.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lateral auto-pilot design for an agile missile using dynamic fuzzy neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7076545/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Lateral auto-pilot design for an agile missile using dynamic fuzzy neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7076545/","accessionNumber":"15090962","publicationDate":"Sept. 2001","dateOfInsertion":"27 April 2015","conferenceDate":"4-7 Sept. 2001","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Sept. 2001","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lateral auto-pilot design for an agile missile using dynamic fuzzy neural networks","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"3911.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058013S","chronDate":"4-7 Sept. 2001","xplore-pub-id":"7075845","isNumber":"7075846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7075845","xplore-issue":"7075846","articleId":"7076545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2001","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUCA","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":7076573,"authors":[{"name":"Ra\u00fal Ch\u00e1vez-Santiago","affiliation":["Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway","Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway","Intervention Centre, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221020/7104199/7076573/santi-small.gif","p":["Ra\u00fal Ch\u00e1vez-Santiago was born in Oaxaca City, Mexico.

Currently, the vast majority of these in-body wireless sensors communicate in frequencies below 1 GHz. Although the radio propagation losses through biological tissues may be lower in such frequencies, e.g., the medical implant communication services band of 402 to 405 MHz, the maximal channel bandwidths allowed therein constrain the implantable devices to low data rate transmissions. Novel and more sophisticated wireless in-body sensors and actuators may require higher data rate communication interfaces. Therefore, the radio spectrum above 1 GHz for the use of wearable medical sensing applications should be considered for in-body applications too. Wider channel bandwidths and smaller antenna sizes may be obtained in frequency bands above 1 GHz at the expense of larger propagation losses. Therefore, in this paper, we present a phantom-based radio propagation study for the frequency bands of 2360 to 2400 MHz, which has been set aside for wearable body area network nodes, and the industrial, scientific, medical band of 2400 to 2483.5 MHz. Three different channel scenarios were considered for the propagation measurements: in-body to in-body, in-body to on-body, and in-body to off-body. We provide for the first time path loss formulas for all these cases.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2015.2418757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7104199","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221020/7104199/07076573.pdf","endPage":"937","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental Path Loss Models for In-Body Communications Within 2.36-2.5\u2009GHz","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2015.2418757","startPage":"930","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7076573","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Path Loss Models for In-Body Communications Within 2.36-2.5\u2009GHz","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7076573/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15111714","pubMedId":"25838532","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7076573/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European COST Action IC1004","grantNumber":"ECOST-STSM-IC1004-17489"},{"fundingName":"Research Council of Norway"},{"fundingName":"MELODY Project-Phase II","grantNumber":"225885"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Path Loss Models for In-Body Communications Within 2.36-2.5\u2009GHz","sourcePdf":"jbhi-chavezsantiago-2418757-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142814S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"7104199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7104199","articleId":"7076573","onlineDate":"01 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7076581,"authors":[{"name":"Leonardo A.

Raw reactants are diluted to solutions with desirable concentration values in this process. Since the reactants, like infant's blood, DNA evidence collected from crime scenes, or costly reagents, are extremely valuable, their usage should be minimized whenever possible. In this paper, we propose a two-phased reactant minimization algorithm (REMIA), for sample preparation on digital microfluidic biochips. In the former phase, REMIA builds a reactant-minimized interpolated dilution tree with specific leaf nodes for a target concentration. Two approaches are developed for tree construction; one is based on integer linear programming (ILP) and the other is heuristic. The ILP one guarantees to produce an optimal dilution tree with minimal reactant consumption, whereas the heuristic one ensures runtime efficiency. Then, REMIA constructs a forest consisting of exponential dilution trees to produce those aforementioned specific leaf nodes with minimal reactant consumption in the latter phase. Experimental results show that REMIA achieves a reduction of reactant usage by 32%-52% as compared with three existing state-of-the-art sample preparation approaches.

with flexible and powerful control on jamming signals throw serious threats on cognitive radio networks, game theory provides a powerful approach to study the interactions between smart jammers and secondary users (SUs). In this work, the power control strategy of an SU against a smart jammer under power constraints is formulated as a Stackelberg game. The jammer as the follower of the game chooses the jamming power according to the observed ongoing transmission, while the SU as the leader determines its transmit power based on the estimated jamming power. The impact of the observation accuracy of the jammer regarding the transmit power of the SU is investigated. The Stackelberg equilibrium of the anti-jamming game is derived and compared with the Nash equilibrium of the game. Simulation results show that the transmission of an SU benefits from the observation error of the jammer with a higher signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and utility.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7076591/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 April 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","volume":"19","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15200574","dateOfInsertion":"08 June 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7076591/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Anti-Jamming Transmission Stackelberg Game With Observation Errors","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"(No.61271242)"},{"fundingName":"US National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1016260, ECCS-1307949 and EARS-1444009"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anti-Jamming Transmission Stackelberg Game With Observation Errors","sourcePdf":"lcomm-xiao-2418776-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079973S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7119623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"7119623","articleId":"7076591","onlineDate":"01 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7076593,"authors":[{"name":"Shijie Zhao","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Shijie","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085474622"},{"name":"Junwei Han","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Junwei","lastName":"Han","id":"37402419300"},{"name":"Jinglei Lv","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jinglei","lastName":"Lv","id":"38021531100"},{"name":"Xi Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The University of Georgia, USA"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37983510900"},{"name":"Xintao Hu","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xintao","lastName":"Hu","id":"37986032400"},{"name":"Yu Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The University of Georgia, USA"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085714006"},{"name":"Bao Ge","affiliation":["School of Physics and Information Technology, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Bao","lastName":"Ge","id":"37071023000"},{"name":"Lei Guo","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Guo","id":"37273151800"},{"name":"Tianming Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The University of Georgia, USA"],"firstName":"Tianming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37293262800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0062"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-254X"}],"articleNumber":"7076593","dbTime":"35 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":838},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"}],"abstract":"Task-based fMRI (tfMRI) has been widely used to explore functional brain networks via predefined stimulus paradigm in the fMRI scan. Traditionally, the general linear model (GLM) has been a dominant approach to detect task-evoked networks. However, GLM focuses on task-evoked or event-evoked brain responses and possibly ignores the intrinsic brain functions. In comparison, dictionary learning and sparse coding methods have attracted much attention recently, and these methods have shown the promise of automatically and systematically decomposing fMRI signals into meaningful task-evoked and intrinsic concurrent networks. Nevertheless, two notable limitations of current data-driven dictionary learning method are that the prior knowledge of task paradigm is not sufficiently utilized and that the establishment of correspondences among dictionary atoms in different brains have been challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised dictionary learning and sparse coding method for inferring functional networks from tfMRI data, which takes both of the advantages of model-driven method and data-driven method.

While many factors, including weather, expected demand, environmental considerations, and coordination of flows with neighboring airports, influence the choice of runway configuration, the actual selection decision is made by air traffic controllers in the airport tower. As a result, the capacity of an airport at any time is dependent on the behavior of human decision makers. This paper develops a statistical model to characterize the configuration selection decision process using empirical observations. The proposed approach, based on the discrete-choice modeling framework, identifies the influence of various factors in terms of the utility function of the decision maker. The parameters of the utility functions are estimated through likelihood maximization. Correlations between different alternatives are captured using a multinomial \u201cnested logit\u201d model. A key novelty of this study is the quantitative assessment of the effect of inertia, or the resistance to configuration changes, on the configuration selection process. The developed models are used to predict the runway configuration 3 h ahead of time, given operating conditions such as wind, visibility, and demand. Case studies based on data from Newark (EWR) and LaGuardia (LGA) airports show that the proposed model predicts runway configuration choices significantly better than a baseline model that only considers the historical frequencies of occurrence of different configurations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Airports","Atmospheric modeling","Predictive models","Data models","Wind","Noise reduction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airports","decision making"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven modeling","airport configuration selection process","airport runway configuration","air traffic controllers","airport tower","human decision makers","statistical model","configuration selection decision process","empirical observation","discrete-choice modeling framework","decision maker utility function","multinomial nested logit model","Newark airport","LaGuardia airport"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Airport runway configuration","air traffic control","air transportation","decision processes","discrete-choice models","maximum-likelihood estimation"]},{"kwd":["Airport runway configuration","air traffic control","air transportation","decision processes","discrete-choice models","maximum-likelihood estimation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/THMS.2015.2411743","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221037/7155607/07076595.pdf","startPage":"490","endPage":"499","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7155607","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THMS.2015.2411743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Modeling of the Airport Configuration Selection Process","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7076595","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Modeling of the Airport Configuration Selection Process","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7076595/","volume":"45","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7076595/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15292379","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 April 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation"},{"fundingName":"NSF CPS project FORCES","grantNumber":"1239054"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Modeling of the Airport Configuration Selection Process","sourcePdf":"thms-balakrishnan-2411743-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116285S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6221037","isNumber":"7155607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221037","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7155607","articleId":"7076595","onlineDate":"01 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7076596,"authors":[{"name":"Fikadu T.

Most prior work at low VHF focuses on longer range path loss modeling, often with one node elevated. In this paper, we study indoor/outdoor near-ground scenarios through experiments and electromagnetic wave propagation simulations. These include the effects of indoor penetration through walls and obstacles, as well as indoor/outdoor cases, for both line of sight (LoS) and nonLoS (NLoS), at ranges up to 200 m. Mounting our receiver (Rx) on a robotic platform enabled the collection of thousands of measurements over an extended indoor/outdoor test area. We measure the channel transfer function, employing bandpass waveform sampling, with pulse and tone probe signals. Based on statistical tests, we show that the measured channels have a nearly ideal scalar attenuation and delay transfer function, with minimal phase distortion, and little to no evidence of multipath propagation. Compared with higher VHF and above, the measured short-range VHF channels do not exhibit small-scale fading, which simplifies communications Rx signal processing, and enables phase-based geolocation techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2015.2418346","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7115198/07076596.pdf","startPage":"2719","endPage":"2727","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2015.2418346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7115198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-Range Low-VHF Channel Characterization in Cluttered Environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7076596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 April 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7076596/","displayDocTitle":"Short-Range Low-VHF Channel Characterization in Cluttered Environments","volume":"63","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15235811","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7076596/","dateOfInsertion":"01 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-Range Low-VHF Channel Characterization in Cluttered Environments","sourcePdf":"tap-dagefu-2418346-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106132S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7115198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7115198","articleId":"7076596","onlineDate":"01 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7076598,"authors":[{"name":"Sanjib Ganguly","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology Rourkela, Rourkela, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165391/7127072/7076598/gangu-2406915-small.gif","p":["\n               Sanjib Ganguly (M12) was born in India in 1981.

The uncertainties of load and generation are modeled using fuzzy-based approach. The optimal locations for DG integration and the optimal amount of generation for these locations are determined by minimizing the network power loss and maximum node voltage deviation. Since GA is a metaheuristic algorithm, the results of multiple runs are taken and the statistical variations for locations and generations for DG units are shown. The locations and sizes for DG units obtained with fuzzy-based approach are found to be different than those obtained with deterministic approach. The results obtained with fuzzy-based approach are found to be comparatively efficient in working with future load growth. The proposed approach is demonstrated on the IEEE 33-node test network and a 52-node Indian practical distribution network.","doi":"10.1109/TSTE.2015.2406915","startPage":"688","endPage":"697","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165391/7127072/07076598.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSTE.2015.2406915","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7127072","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Generation Allocation on Radial Distribution Networks Under Uncertainties of Load and Generation Using Genetic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Planning","Load modeling","Linear programming","Genetic algorithms","Resource management","Uncertainty","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","distribution networks","fuzzy set theory","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed generation allocation","radial distribution networks","load uncertainty","generation uncertainty","genetic algorithm","DG allocation strategy","adaptive GA","fuzzy-based approach","DG integration","network power loss","node voltage deviation","metaheuristic algorithm","IEEE 33-node test network","52-node Indian practical distribution network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed generation (DG)","distribution system","fuzzy load and generation","genetic algorithm","power loss"]},{"kwd":["Distributed generation (DG)","distribution system","fuzzy load and generation","genetic algorithm","power loss"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7076598/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 April 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Generation Allocation on Radial Distribution Networks Under Uncertainties of Load and Generation Using Genetic Algorithm","volume":"6","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7076598/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15219260","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Generation Allocation on Radial Distribution Networks Under Uncertainties of Load and Generation Using Genetic Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tste-ganguly-2406915-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094007S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5165391","isNumber":"7127072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"138","xplore-issue":"7127072","articleId":"7076598","onlineDate":"01 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":7076607,"authors":[{"name":"Ling Zhao","affiliation":["Hebei Province Key Laboratory of Heavy Machinery Fluid Power Transmission and Control, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7182400/7076607/zhao-2418319-small.gif","p":["\n\nLing Zhao received the B.S. degree in automation from Southwest \nUniversity, Chongqing, China, in 2007 and the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering from Beijing Institute of \nTechnology, Beijing, China, in 2012.","She is currently a Teacher with the College of Mechanical Engineering, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China.

It is very hard to achieve precise position control of magnetic rodless cylinders due to nonlinearity from large friction force and hysteresis. In this paper, the overshoot, which has a negative influence on position control, is effectively reduced by using a tracking differentiator. Furthermore, the nonlinearity is estimated by a designed extended-state observer. In addition, the self-stable region theory is used to prove the convergence of the extended-state observer. Finally, both control precision and response speed are guaranteed via a nonlinear error feedback controller in the pneumatic system. Experimental results show that the steady-state error within 0.05 mm is achieved for a step signal.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7182400/07076607.pdf","startPage":"5838","endPage":"5846","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2418319","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2418319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7182400","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7076607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active Disturbance Rejection Position Control for a Magnetic Rodless Pneumatic Cylinder","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Observers","Servomotors","Position control","Pneumatic systems","Trajectory","Adaptive control","Friction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active disturbance rejection control","control system synthesis","convergence","feedback","hysteresis","nonlinear control systems","observers","pneumatic systems","position control","shapes (structures)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic rodless pneumatic cylinder","active disturbance rejection position control scheme","servo system","friction force","hysteresis","tracking differentiator","extended-state observer","self-stable region theory","convergence","nonlinear error feedback controller","pneumatic system","steady-state error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Magnetic rodless pneumatic cylinder","positioning control","active disturbance rejection control","self-stable region"]},{"kwd":["Active disturbance rejection control","magnetic rodless pneumatic cylinder","positioning control","self-stable region"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7076607/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Active Disturbance Rejection Position Control for a Magnetic Rodless Pneumatic Cylinder","volume":"62","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7076607/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15359543","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2012CB720000 and 2014CB046405"},{"fundingName":"Hebei Provincial Natural Science Fund","grantNumber":"E2014203122"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61225015"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61225015"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61321002"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61473247 and 61104033"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003787","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province","grantNumber":"F2012203109"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Disturbance Rejection Position Control for a Magnetic Rodless Pneumatic Cylinder","sourcePdf":"tie-xia-2418319-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09308S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7182400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"7182400","articleId":"7076607","onlineDate":"01 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7076608,"authors":[{"name":"Tommaso Muciaccia","affiliation":["Photonics Research Group, Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, Politecnico di Bari, Bari, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Tommaso","lastName":"Muciaccia","id":"37085461029"},{"name":"Fabio Gargano","affiliation":["Photonics Research Group, Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, Politecnico di Bari, Bari, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Gargano","id":"37268680900"},{"name":"Vittorio M.

Time and wavelength division multiplexed PON (TWDM-PON) has already been chosen by ITU-T as one of the best architectures in brownfield contexts to allow the reuse of the optical distribution network. Our proposal exploits the advantages of TWDM in order to reach a balance between coexistence with legacy systems and gradual and cost-effective migration towards pure wavelength division multiplexed PON (WDM-PON). In order to fulfill this aim, with reference to downstream traffic enhancement, two main novelties are presented: 1) the use of a multi-pump Raman amplifier (MRA) to satisfy the future necessity of large gain bandwidth; 2) the introduction of advanced modulation techniques to increase spectral efficiency and the future number of user channels (a less than 7 GHz-wide channel bandwidth providing 10 Gb/s bitrate has been demonstrated). A coherent system has been also proposed and its main impairments have been evaluated. The MRA has been accurately optimized to minimize power consumption without compromising performances. In the upstream direction, a semiconductor optical amplifier has been considered. The performances of the proposed TWDM-PON have been predicted through numerical simulations based on a system-level commercial CAD software.","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7156191/07076608.pdf","startPage":"2986","endPage":"2996","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7156191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2418432","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2418432","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7076608","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Passive optical networks","Optical fiber amplifiers","Optical amplifiers","Stimulated emission","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CAD","optical communication equipment","optical fibre subscriber loops","optical modulation","Raman lasers","semiconductor optical amplifiers","time division multiplexing","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TWDM-PON","advanced modulation techniques","multipump Raman amplifier","cost-effective migration","UDWDM-PON","ultradense wavelength-division multiplexing passive optical networks","passive optical network stage 3 access networks","telecommunication operators","time and wavelength division multiplexed PON","ITU-T","optical distribution network","legacy systems","pure wavelength division multiplexed PON","downstream traffic enhancement","MRA","spectral efficiency","channel bandwidth","power consumption","semiconductor optical amplifier","numerical simulations","system-level commercial CAD software","bit rate 10 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["optical access networks","FTTH","NGPON3","TWDM-PON","Raman amplifier","SOA"]},{"kwd":["FTTH","NGPON3","optical access networks","Raman amplifier","SOA","TWDM-PON"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July15, 15 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7076608/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"A TWDM-PON With Advanced Modulation Techniques and a Multi-Pump Raman Amplifier for Cost-Effective Migration to Future UDWDM-PONs","accessionNumber":"15292258","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2015","publicationDate":"15 July15, 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7076608/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"33","issue":"14","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Politecnico di Bari"},{"fundingName":"Fondo di ricerca di Ateneo"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A TWDM-PON With Advanced Modulation Techniques and a Multi-Pump Raman Amplifier for Cost-Effective Migration to Future UDWDM-PONs","sourcePdf":"jlt-passaro-2418432-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091484S","chronDate":"July15, 15 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7156191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7156191","articleId":"7076608","onlineDate":"01 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7076610,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Hell","affiliation":["Computer Graphics Laboratory, Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/7110434/7076610/hell-2419078-small.gif","p":["Benjamin Hell received the master\u2019s degree in industrial mathematics from the University of Bayreuth, Germany, in 2011.

The presented model is in some ways related to the well-known Mumford-Shah model, but deviates in certain important aspects. The optimization problem has been designed with two goals in mind. The objective function should represent fundamental concepts of image segmentation, such as incorporation of weighted curve length and variation of intensity in the segmented regions, while allowing transformation into a convex concave saddle point problem that is computationally inexpensive to solve. This paper introduces such a model, the nontrivial transformation of this model into a convex-concave saddle point problem, and the numerical treatment of the problem. We evaluate our approach by applying our algorithm to various images and show that our results are competitive in terms of quality at unprecedentedly low computation times. Our algorithm allows high-quality segmentation of megapixel images in a few seconds and achieves interactive performance for low resolution images (Fig. 1).","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2015.2419078","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7110434/07076610.pdf","startPage":"2633","endPage":"2645","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2015.2419078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7110434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Approach Toward Fast Gradient-Based Image Segmentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7076610/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"An Approach Toward Fast Gradient-Based Image Segmentation","volume":"24","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15143274","pubMedId":"25838522","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7076610/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Union within the Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013","grantNumber":"256941"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Approach Toward Fast Gradient-Based Image Segmentation","sourcePdf":"tip-hell-2419078-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090376S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7110434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7110434","articleId":"7076610","onlineDate":"01 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":7076612,"authors":[{"name":"Yirui Cong","affiliation":["Research School of Engineering, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7182829/7076612/cong-2418763-small.gif","p":["\n\nYirui Cong (S'14) received the B.E. degree (outstanding graduates) in \nautomation from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2011.

This paper investigates interference prediction in MANETs with a finite number of nodes by proposing and using a general-order linear model for node mobility. The proposed mobility model can well approximate node dynamics of practical MANETs. In contrast to previous studies on interference statistics, we are able through this model to give a best estimate of the time-varying interference at any time rather than long-term average effects. Specifically, we propose a compound Gaussian point process functional as a general framework to obtain analytical results on the mean value and moment-generating function of the interference prediction. With a series form of this functional, we give the necessary and sufficient condition for when the prediction is essentially equivalent to that from a binomial point process (BPP) network in the limit as time goes to infinity. These conditions permit one to rigorously determine when the commonly used BPP approximations are valid. Finally, our simulation results corroborate the effectiveness and accuracy of the analytical results on interference prediction and also show the advantages of our method in dealing with complex mobilities.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7076612/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7076612/","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15364401","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Interference Prediction in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks With a General Mobility Model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Prediction in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks With a General Mobility Model","sourcePdf":"twc-cong-2418763-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11702S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7182829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7182829","articleId":"7076612","onlineDate":"01 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":7076615,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Hosseinzadeh","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165391/7127072/7076615/hosse-2405935-small.gif","p":["\n               Mehdi Hosseinzadeh (S13) received the B.S. degree from the University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran, in 2008, and the M.Sc. degree from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2010, both in electrical engineering.

This necessitates a supervisory control system to split power between its different resources, which has sparked attention on the development of power management systems (PMSs). In this paper, a robust optimal PMS (ROPMS) is developed for a hybrid ac/dc micro-grid, where the power flow in the micro-grid is supervised based on solving an optimization problem. Satisfying demanded power with maximum utilization of renewable resources, minimum usage of fuel-based generator, extending batteries lifetime, and limited utilization of the main power converter between the ac and dc micro-grids are important factors that are considered in this approach. Uncertainties in the resources output power and generation forecast errors, along with static and dynamic constraints of the resources, are taken into account. Furthermore, since uncertainties in the resources output power may result in fluctuations in the dc bus voltage, a two-level controller is used to regulate charge/discharge power of the battery banks. Effectiveness of the proposed supervisory system is evaluated through extensive simulation runs based on dynamical models of the power resources.","doi":"10.1109/TSTE.2015.2405935","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165391/7127072/07076615.pdf","startPage":"675","endPage":"687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7127072","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSTE.2015.2405935","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Optimal Power Management System for a Hybrid AC/DC Micro-Grid","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7076615","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","displayDocTitle":"Robust Optimal Power Management System for a Hybrid AC/DC Micro-Grid","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7076615/","publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 June 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15219243","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7076615/","volume":"6","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 April 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Optimal Power Management System for a Hybrid AC/DC Micro-Grid","sourcePdf":"tste-hosseinzadeh-2405935-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136168S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5165391","isNumber":"7127072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"173","xplore-issue":"7127072","articleId":"7076615","onlineDate":"01 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7076617,"authors":[{"name":"Jeehoon Lee","affiliation":["School of Information and Communications, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, Korea"],"firstName":"Jeehoon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37336635300"},{"name":"Minjoong Rim","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Dongguk University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Minjoong","lastName":"Rim","id":"37302119800"},{"name":"Kiseon Kim","affiliation":["Department of Nano-bio Materials and Electronics, School of Information and Communications, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, Korea"],"firstName":"Kiseon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280247300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"7076617","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":264},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7076617","abstract":"Analog network coding (ANC) is an effective scheme for increasing network throughput by simultaneously transmitting packets from sources to a relay and amplifying and forwarding the superposition of the packets from the relay to the corresponding destinations. The ANC scheme theoretically reduces half of the required transmission phases in cooperative relaying networks, including two source-destination pairs and a single relay. Such an advantage can be obtained only when the impact of the quality of overhearing links (OLs) on the decoding results of the desired signals at the targeted destinations is negligible. However, in practical wireless environments, the network throughput of the ANC scheme may not be doubled and may be even worse than that of a conventional amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying scheme due to poor channel quality of the OLs.

While it had been considered infeasible for a long time due to strong self-interference, recent researches have made substantial progress on addressing this challenge. This paper focuses on designing full-duplex cellular networks with co-channel femtocells. Due to relatively high transmit power, cancellation of self-interference by existing techniques could still be imperfect for cellular systems and thus residual interference may impact performance significantly. To overcome this in OFDMA systems, a new radio resource management scheme assigning downlink and uplink transmissions jointly while considering the gain of self-interference cancellation is developed. Three available transmission modes of a frequency resource block and crossover points between their achievable capacities are identified for the mode selection of each resource block. Users are then assigned resource blocks and transmit power levels are determined such that the total utility sum is maximized. To handle new femtocell interference scenarios, the transmit powers of femtocells and their connected users are adjusted by a coordination algorithm such that both data transmission and mode selection of an underlying macrocell are protected.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2015.2418755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7373720","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2015.2418755","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/7373720/07076623.pdf","startPage":"392","endPage":"405","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intra and Inter-Cell Resource Management in Full-Duplex Heterogeneous Cellular Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Intra and Inter-Cell Resource Management in Full-Duplex Heterogeneous Cellular Networks","volume":"15","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 1 2016","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7076623/","publicationDate":"1 Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15696291","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7076623/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"NRF-2014R1A1A2059515"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intra and Inter-Cell Resource Management in Full-Duplex Heterogeneous Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"tmc-yun-2418755-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160851S","chronDate":"Feb. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"7373720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7373720","articleId":"7076623","onlineDate":"01 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7076629,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Schwarz","affiliation":["Chair of Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570655/7084230/7076629/7076629-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andreas Schwarz studied electrical engineering, electronics and information technology at the Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Germany.

Several novel unbiased CDR estimators are proposed, and it is shown that knowledge of either the direction of arrival (DOA) of the target source or the coherence of the noise field is sufficient for unbiased CDR estimation. The validity of the model for the application of CDR estimates to dereverberation is investigated using measured and simulated impulse responses.

Specifically, the source cooperates with friendly intermediate nodes to transmit message securely in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. We propose a cooperative framework, whereby the source selects multiple partners and stimulates them by granting an amount of reward. First, multiple cooperative relays and jammers are selected by the source using greedy or cross-entropy based approaches. Then, the source and the partners negotiate for the payment and transmission power, which is modeled as a two-layer game. At the top layer, a buyer-seller game is utilized, where the source buys the service provided by the partners. At the bottom layer, all the partners share the reward by determining their transmission powers in a distributed way, which is formulated as a non-cooperative power selection game. By analyzing the game, the partners can determine the transmission powers for cooperation, while the source can select the best payment. To further improve the utility of the source, a set of reward allocation coefficients are introduced and optimized using particle swarm optimization approach. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7076633/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 April 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","volume":"14","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15364423","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7076633/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Partner selection and incentive mechanism for physical layer security","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partner selection and incentive mechanism for physical layer security","sourcePdf":"twc-zhang-2418316-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116917S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7182829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"7182829","articleId":"7076633","onlineDate":"01 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7076636,"authors":[{"name":"Hongfei Wu","affiliation":["Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Energy Generation and Power Conversion, College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hongfei","lastName":"Wu","orcid":"0000-0002-9221-7041","id":"37405484400"},{"name":"Tiantian Mu","affiliation":["Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Energy Generation and Power Conversion, College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Tiantian","lastName":"Mu","id":"37085449662"},{"name":"Xun Gao","affiliation":["Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Energy Generation and Power Conversion, College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xun","lastName":"Gao","id":"37085596013"},{"name":"Yan Xing","affiliation":["Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Energy Generation and Power Conversion, College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Xing","id":"37270852600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8993"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0107"}],"articleNumber":"7076636","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":79,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3790},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-pels.org/"}],"abstract":"A novel secondary-side phase-shift-controlled (SS-PSC) LLC resonant converter is proposed for applications requiring hold-up time operation, such as distributed power systems and server power supplies. High efficiency at the normal input voltage is achieved because the proposed SS-PSC LLC converter always operates at the series-resonant frequency of the resonant tank. The magnetizing inductor of the proposed converter does not need to be reduced to provide desired voltage boost ratio for the hold-up time operation, which results in reduced conduction losses and improved efficiency. Sufficient voltage boost ratio for the hold-up time operation is provided by using SS-PSC strategy. In comparison with the conventional variable-frequency-controlled (VFC) LLC resonant converter, the main advantages are that the circulating current caused by the magnetizing inductor is effectively suppressed and the efficiency of normal operation is significantly improved. The operation principles, output characteristics, and design considerations of the proposed converter are presented in detail. Experimental results are given to verify the effectiveness and the advantages of the proposed solutions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power

The drive comprises a five-phase induction machine with open-end stator windings, supplied using two two-level voltage-source inverters with isolated and unequal dc-link voltages, in the ratio 2\u2009:\u20091. The topology offers the advantages of a modular structure with fewer semiconductor components and has a greater potential for fault tolerance, as compared with an equivalent single-sided four-level drive. Due to the large number of switching states, development of a suitable space vector pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) method can be challenging. Hence, this paper examines the implementation of two-level-shifted carrier-based PWM methods. The effect of dead time on the drive performance is discussed, and it is shown that simultaneous PWM switching of both inverters can lead to degraded output phase voltage waveforms. Detailed analysis of this phenomenon is presented, a solution is proposed, and the modified modulation techniques are incorporated in an experimental setup, at first in conjunction with \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$V/f$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n control.

The selected bit series is Slepian-Wolf encoded using low-density parity check codes. On the receiver side, the secret bits can be extracted if the image receiver has the embedding key only. In case the receiver has the encryption key only, he/she can recover the original image approximately with high quality using an image estimation algorithm. If the receiver has both the embedding and encryption keys, he/she can extract the secret data and perfectly recover the original image using the distributed source decoding.

At algorithm level, a low-complexity hybrid decomposition scheme is adopted, which switches, depending on the energy distribution of spatial channels, between the traditional brute-force SQRD and a proposed group-sort QR-update strategy. A reconfigurable vector processor is accordingly developed to support the adaptive processing with high hardware efficiency. Furthermore, on-chip power management technique is also integrated to obtain real-time power-saving by adapting the voltage supply based on the instantaneous workload. As a proof-of-concept, we implemented the processor using a 65 nm CMOS technology and conducted post-layout simulation.

Since numerical analysis of electromagnetic fields such as the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method directly solves Maxwell's equations, it is an appropriate means for solving this issue. In this paper, the lightning surge waveform due to the back-flashover is analyzed using the FDTD method; bearing detailed modeling of transmission towers and incoming substation lines in mind. An open end of a circuit breaker of a 500 kV air-insulated substation was selected as the subject of analysis, and ac operation voltage was considered as an analysis condition. Following FDTD analysis, a 150 kA lightning stroke to the first tower, which is the standard lightning stroke of the lightning protection design, does not cause back-flashover, but a 200 kA lightning stroke to the first tower and a 150 kA lightning stroke to the second did do so. The flashover occurred in the later timing than the result of conventional circuit analysis, and the rise of the lightning surge was also slower. The voltage waveform of the open end of the circuit breaker reached its peak after repeating reflections, and the overvoltage value became lower than the circuit analysis. According to the FDTD analysis, the required withstand voltage value after the waveform evaluation with a 200 kA lightning stroke is 1,337 kV, which is lower than the present lightning impulse withstand voltage (LIWV) 1,550 kV. The lightning stroke current 200 kA is the value adopted in the lightning protection design of the UHV system. Therefore, the existing air-insulated substation equipment is considered highly capable of withstanding overvoltage at the time of a back-flashover.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel7/94/7076753/07076779.pdf","startPage":"806","endPage":"814","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2015.7076779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2015.7076779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7076753","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7076779","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD simulation considering an AC operating voltage for air-insulation substation in terms of lightning protective level","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lightning","Poles and towers","Integrated circuit modeling","Substations","Surges","Finite difference methods","Circuit breakers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit breakers","finite difference time-domain analysis","flashover","lightning protection","overvoltage protection","poles and towers","substation insulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lightning overvoltage evaluation","electrical equipment","circuit analysis","electromagnetic transients program","plane wave propagation mode","TEM mode","numerical analysis","finite-difference time-domain method","FDTD method","Maxwell's equations","lightning surge waveform","back-flashover","transmission towers","substation lines","circuit breaker","air-insulated substation","ac operation voltage","lightning protection design","voltage waveform","withstand voltage value","waveform evaluation","lightning impulse withstand voltage","LIWV","lightning stroke current","UHV system","current 150 kA","current 200 kA","voltage 500 kV","voltage 1337 kV","voltage 1550 kV"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Transmission line","substation","incoming line","lightning surge","back flashover","FDTD simulation","lightning impulse withstand voltage"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7076779/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"FDTD simulation considering an AC operating voltage for air-insulation substation in terms of lightning protective level","volume":"22","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7076779/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15041129","dateOfInsertion":"09 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD simulation considering an AC operating voltage for air-insulation substation in terms of lightning protective level","sourcePdf":"p0806-takami.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09084S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"7076753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7076753","articleId":"7076779","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7076794,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The prominent characteristics of the SiR coating are the hydrophobicity and the hydrophobicity recovery, which can suppress the development of leakage currents and dry-band discharges, and prevent the flashover incidents. Fluorination is a method to change the chemical component of the surface layer of polymers, which could induce the corresponding change in hydrophobicity and some electrical properties, thus influencing the dc surface flashover characteristics. Room temperature vulcanized (RTV) SiR samples were fluorinated in a stainless reaction vessel at about 298K (25\u00b0C) using a F2/N2 mixture with 12% F2 by volume and 0.05 MPa (500 mbar) for respectively 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes. The hydrophobicity of samples with different fluorination time was measured by the static contact angle tests after corona aging. The variation of hydrophobicity with the lapse of time was recorded. DC flashover tests in different conditions were carried out between two plane electrodes on top of the material sample. The flashover voltage was found to be associated with the surface hydrophobicity status of samples. Obtained results showed the effects of the fluorination on the surface charge, hydrophobicity performance and dc flashover voltage. It is suggested that the appropriate fluorination can improve surface hydrophobicity and suppress surface charge accumulation, thus raising the dc flashover voltage.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hydrophobicity, surface charge and DC flashover characteristics of direct-fluorinated RTV silicone rubber","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2015.7076794","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel7/94/7076753/07076794.pdf","startPage":"934","endPage":"940","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2015.7076794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7076753","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7076794","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7076794/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 April 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","displayDocTitle":"Hydrophobicity, surface charge and DC flashover characteristics of direct-fluorinated RTV silicone rubber","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7076794/","dateOfInsertion":"09 April 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15041095","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hydrophobicity, surface charge and DC flashover characteristics of direct-fluorinated RTV silicone rubber","sourcePdf":"p0934-du.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069913S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"7076753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7076753","articleId":"7076794","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7076798,"authors":[{"name":"Shahid Alam","affiliation":["High Voltage Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/94/7076753/7076798/7076798-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shahid Alam was born in Peshawar, Pakistan, in 1986.

At present, there are two different types of data patterns used for analysis and evaluation of PD signals: phase resolved partial discharge (PRPD) mode and time resolved partial discharge (TRPD) mode. Using different types of data patterns separately can lead to inconsistent or even conflicted recognition results, but the two types of data patterns having complementary information between each other can be used together for data fusion. Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidence theory is introduced to address the problem of evidence conflict and low fusion efficiency. First, two sub-networks for PD recognition are established and compared employing the back propagation neural network (BPNN) learning algorithm under the two modes respectively. Secondly, to minimize (with possible elimination of) the possibility of misclassification, a new fusion decision-making system for PD recognition is proposed on the basis of fusing the results from the sub-networks. Finally, extensive field experiments on two artificial defects are conducted in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in this paper. The classification results reveal that the proposed method significantly outperforms the ways of using only single type of data patterns. The method proposed in this paper reduces the uncertainty and effectively improves the credibility of diagnosis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7076809/","volume":"22","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7076809/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15041108","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 April 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Partial discharge recognition in gas insulated switchgear based on multi-information fusion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial discharge recognition in gas insulated switchgear based on multi-information fusion","sourcePdf":"p1080-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061936S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"7076753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7076753","articleId":"7076809","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":7076812,"authors":[{"name":"Junhyuck Seo","affiliation":["The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/94/7076753/7076812/7076812-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Junhyuck Seo (S\u2018 13) received his B.Eng degree from Gyeongsang National University, South Korea in 2001 and the M.Phil degree from the University of Queensland, Australia in 2014.

However, extensive interferences and noise can significantly jeopardize the measured PD signals and cause ambiguity in PD measurement interpretation. Necessary PD signal de-noising techniques need to be adopted and wavelet transform is one of such techniques. Mother wavelet selection, decomposition level determination and thresholding are important processes for effective PD extraction using wavelet transform. Various methods have been proposed in the literature to improve the above processes of wavelet transform. In these methods a single threshold is normally adopted at each decomposition level and a binary decision is made to indicate whether an extracted signal is PD signal or noise. However, in online PD measurements it is difficult to find a threshold, which can be used for extracting only PD signals without including any noise. As such, the signals determined by a single threshold cannot be assured as PD signals with certainty. To address the limitations caused by the single thresholding method in wavelet transform for PD signals extraction, this paper proposes quantile based multi-scale thresholding method at each decomposition level, which can thus provide probability indexes for the extracted signals evaluating the likelihood of these signals to be PD signals. To evaluate the proposed method, PD measurements have been conducted on both experimental PD models and inservice transformers at substation. The results are provided in the paper.","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2015.7076812","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel7/94/7076753/07076812.pdf","startPage":"1105","endPage":"1117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2015.7076812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7076753","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic wavelet transform for partial discharge measurement of transformer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7076812","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 April 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7076812/","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic wavelet transform for partial discharge measurement of transformer","volume":"22","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15041077","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7076812/","dateOfInsertion":"09 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic wavelet transform for partial discharge measurement of transformer","sourcePdf":"p1105-seo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066202S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"7076753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7076753","articleId":"7076812","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7076892,"authors":[{"name":"Shamsul Anuar Mokhtar","affiliation":["Malaysian Institute of Information Technology (MIIT) University Kuala Lumpur, kuala lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Shamsul Anuar","lastName":"Mokhtar","id":"38253679900"},{"name":"Siti Haryani Shaikh Ali","affiliation":["Malaysian Inst. of Inf.

The load is also uncertain. Hence, it is necessary to use power reserve equipment to compensate unforeseen imbalances between production and load. However, this power reserve must be ideally minimized in order to reduce the system cost with a satisfying security level. The quantification of power reserve could be calculated through analysis of forecasting uncertainty errors of both generation and load. Therefore, in this paper, a back propagation artificial neural network approaches is derived to forecast solar radiations. Predictions have been analyzed according to weather classification. Some error indexes have been introduced to evaluate forecasting models performances and calculate the prediction accuracy.

This is done based on a pattern recognition approach using higher order statistics (HOS) features and a decision tree (J48) classifier. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of space-time block coding (STBC) techniques, a comparative study is performed between the Quasi-Orthogonal STBC (QOSTBC) and the orthogonal STBC (OSTBC).

Therefore, the ability of determine voltage stability before voltage collapse has received a great attention due to the complexity of power system. This paper proposes a particle swarm optimization method for solving optimal reactive power planning (ORPP) problem using Thyristor Controlled Series Compensator (TCSC). The proposed PSO have been applied for the ORPP problem to improve the system voltage stability by minimizing the fast voltage stability index (FVSI) and to minimize the investment cost of TCSC devices and the system voltage deviations, satisfying various constraints of power flow equation, generator voltage limits, TCSC's reactance limits, transformer tap changer limits, and transmission line limits. The Fast Voltage Stability Index (FVSI) are used to identify the stressed lines which will receive the FACTS devices (TCSC). The proposed method has been examined and tested on the Algerian electric power system 114-bus and the obtained results are compared with two other methods, namely, Genetic Algorithm (GA), interior point method (IPM).The result comparisons demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach and show its effectiveness and robustness to solve the ORPP problem. Therefore, the proposed PSO can be a promising solution method for dealing the ORPP problem.","doi":"10.1109/CISTEM.2014.7077015","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Electrical Sciences and Technologies in Maghreb (CISTEM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISTEM.2014.7077015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7076747","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Electrical Sciences and Technologies in Maghreb (CISTEM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7064053/7076747/07077015.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle swarm optimization based reactive power planning for voltage stability improvement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7077015/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Particle swarm optimization based reactive power planning for voltage stability improvement","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7077015/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15026243","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"3-6 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Nov. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle swarm optimization based reactive power planning for voltage stability improvement","confLoc":"Tunis, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"RF51461562014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077441S","chronDate":"3-6 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7064053","isNumber":"7076747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7064053","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7076747","articleId":"7077015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7077021,"authors":[{"name":"Mustafa Mosbah","affiliation":["Distribution Company SDC, Sonelgaz, Algiers Algeria"],"firstName":"Mustafa","lastName":"Mosbah","id":"37085798967"},{"name":"Abdelhafid Hellal","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'Analyse et de Commande des Syst\u00e8mes d'Energie et R\u00e9seaux Electriques (LACoSERE) University of Laghouat, Algeria"],"firstName":"Abdelhafid","lastName":"Hellal","id":"37563496600"},{"name":"Ridha djamel Mohammedi","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'Analyse et de Commande des Syst\u00e8mes d'Energie et R\u00e9seaux Electriques (LACoSERE) University of Laghouat, Algeria"],"firstName":"Ridha djamel","lastName":"Mohammedi","id":"37085465055"},{"name":"Salem Arif","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'Analyse et de Commande des Syst\u00e8mes d'Energie et R\u00e9seaux Electriques (LACoSERE) University of Laghouat, Algeria"],"firstName":"Salem","lastName":"Arif","id":"37872875100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7300-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7077021","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7077021","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transient analysis","Power system stability","Stability analysis","Load flow","Optimization","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","IEEE standards","load flow","load shedding","power system dynamic stability","power system transient stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","optimal load shedding","transient stability constraints","voltage collapse","under voltage load shedding","UVLS","optimal power flow procedure","TSC optimal power flow","meta-heuristic approach","electrical network","IEEE 30 bus network model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["under voltage","load shedding","optimal power flow","stability constraints"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CISTEM.2014.7077021","pdfPath":"/iel7/7064053/7076747/07077021.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Electrical Sciences and Technologies in Maghreb (CISTEM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Electrical Sciences and Technologies in Maghreb (CISTEM)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7076747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISTEM.2014.7077021","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic Algorithms based Optimal Load Shedding with Transient Stability Constraints","abstract":"This paper proposes a technique for shedding against voltage collapse (Under Voltage Load Shedding or UVLS) which is based on the optimal power flow procedure OPF with transient stability constraints (Transient Stability Constraints Optimal Power Flow TSC-OPF).

These models are used to help refine and enrich the requirements for the system. Unified Modelling Language (UML) has become the standard for modelling software requirements. However, software requirements are captured in the form of Natural Language and, generating UML models from natural language requirements relies heavily on individual expertise. In this paper, we present an approach towards automated generation of behavioural UML models, namely activity diagrams and sequence diagrams. Our approach is based on transforming the requirements statements to intermediary structured representations \u2014 frames and then, translate them to the behavioural UML models. We are using Grammatical Knowledge Patterns and lexical and syntactic analysis of requirements statements to populate frames for the corresponding statements. Knowledge stored in frames is then used to automatically generate activity and sequence diagram. We present our approach through the case-studies performed.","publicationTitle":"2014 9th International Conference on Evaluation of Novel Approaches to Software Engineering (ENASE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 9th International Conference on Evaluation of Novel Approaches to Software Engineering (ENASE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7052447/7077084/07077118.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077084","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated generation of activity and sequence diagrams from natural language requirements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7077118/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 April 2014","displayDocTitle":"Automated generation of activity and sequence diagrams from natural language requirements","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7077118/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","publicationDate":"April 2014","conferenceDate":"28-30 April 2014","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated generation of activity and sequence diagrams from natural language requirements","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"ENASE201433CR.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099289S","chronDate":"28-30 April 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7052447","isNumber":"7077084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7052447","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7077084","articleId":"7077118","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"SCITEPRESS","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7077159,"authors":[{"name":"Steve Freeland","affiliation":["Power Electronics Group, California Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Freeland"},{"name":"R.D.

Recognition of the topological structure uniting these converters \u2014 and the PWM converters on which they are based \u2014 leads to general models of their dc and low-frequency ac behavior. An expression is derived that yields the dc conversion ratio of a quasi-resonant converter in terms of the well-known conversion ratio of the underlying PWM topology. A small-signal, low-frequency dynamic model is developed whose parameters also incorporate the PWM conversion ratio. The dc and ac models reveal that any quasi-resonant converter with a full-wave resonant switch has dc and low-frequency behavior identical to that of its PWM parent, with switching frequency control replacing duty ratio control. Converters with half-wave resonant switches act more like PWM converters under current programming or discontinuous conduction mode, exhibiting lossless damping in the small-signal model and output resistance at dc.","displayPublicationTitle":"1987 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7079171/7077145/07077159.pdf","startPage":"20","endPage":"30","publicationTitle":"1987 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1987.7077159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1987.7077159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077145","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7077159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A unified analysis of converters with resonant switches","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation converters","Pulse width modulation","Topology","Transistors","Switches","Inductors","Equations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7077159/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-26 June 1987","displayDocTitle":"A unified analysis of converters with resonant switches","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 1987","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"21-26 June 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified analysis of converters with resonant switches","confLoc":"Blacksburg, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"020030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022404S","chronDate":"21-26 June 1987","isNumber":"7077145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7079171","citationCount":"40","articleId":"7077159","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7077181,"authors":[{"name":"Robert John Dirkman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Lowell, Lowell, Massachusetts"],"firstName":"Robert John","lastName":"Dirkman"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-9306"}],"articleNumber":"7077181","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7077181","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Equations","Mathematical model","Inductors","Capacitors","Integrated circuit modeling","Switching circuits"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PESC.1987.7077181","publicationTitle":"1987 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"1987 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7079171/7077145/07077181.pdf","startPage":"185","endPage":"194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1987.7077181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The simulation of general circuits containing ideal switches","abstract":"Issues related to the design and use of a digital computer simulation of generai circuits containing ideal switching elements are presented.

The power factor is controlled by adjusting the relative position of the fundamental component of an optimized PWM type voltage with respect to the supply voltage. Current harmonic distortion is minimized by the use of optimized firing angles for the converter at a frequency where GTO's can be used. This feature makes this approach very attractive at power levels of 100 kW to 600 kW. An 8096 microcontroller is used to minimize the interface hardware requirements. This paper presents the theoretical analysis of the converter, the control strategy and experimental results for a low power prototype.","displayPublicationTitle":"1987 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7079171/7077145/07077190.pdf","startPage":"264","endPage":"270","publicationTitle":"1987 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1987.7077190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1987.7077190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077145","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7077190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high frequency AC/DC converter with unity power factor and minimum harmonic distortion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Reactive power","Steady-state","Microcontrollers","Switches","Capacitors","Harmonic analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7077190/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-26 June 1987","displayDocTitle":"A high frequency AC/DC converter with unity power factor and minimum harmonic distortion","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 1987","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"21-26 June 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high frequency AC/DC converter with unity power factor and minimum harmonic distortion","confLoc":"Blacksburg, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"264270.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032369S","chronDate":"21-26 June 1987","isNumber":"7077145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7079171","citationCount":"18","articleId":"7077190","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7077193,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Experimental verification of the control to output transfer function and the output impedance is presented, and good agreement between theory and experiment is obtained.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","Mathematical model","Equations","Capacitors","Switching frequency","Steady-state","Switches"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1987.7077243","startPage":"693","endPage":"704","publicationTitle":"1987 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"1987 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7079171/7077145/07077243.pdf","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1987.7077243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Small signal ac equivalent circuit modelling of the series resonant converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Small signal ac equivalent circuit modelling of the series resonant converter","publicationDate":"June 1987","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-26 June 1987","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7077243/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-26 June 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small signal ac equivalent circuit modelling of the series resonant converter","confLoc":"Blacksburg, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"693704.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027386S","chronDate":"21-26 June 1987","isNumber":"7077145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7079171","citationCount":"25","articleId":"7077243","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7077247,"authors":[{"name":"Walter Houser","affiliation":["Open Web Application Securtity Project"],"bio":{"p":["Walter Houser is an application security engineer supporting a major government organization.

It is regularly considered in the literature but no satisfactory solution is known and only sensitivity or performance analyses of existing methods (usually subspace-based) are proposed mostly in the exact data case. We show that projecting the observations on the nominal array manifold is a solution to this problem that greatly reduces the degradations in performance induced by modeling errors. Except for some very specific array geometries, this projection is unfeasible in practice, hence the interest of the Global Matched Filter (GMF) which, when using as inputs a finite number of beamformer-outputs, benefits from the projection that is implicitly performed by the conventional beamformer. Its performance is quite remarkable.","publicationTitle":"2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference","startPage":"1963","endPage":"1967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077262","pdfPath":"/iel7/7077261/7077262/07077269.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Direction-of-arrival estimation","Matched filters","Abstracts","Covariance matrices","Noise","Simulation","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","geometry","matched filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction of arrival estimation","DOA estimation","modeling errors","global matched filter approach","GMF","array manifold","array geometries","beamformer-outputs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"DOA estimation in the presence of modeling errors, the Global Matched Filter approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7077269/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7077269/","accessionNumber":"15036616","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DOA estimation in the presence of modeling errors, the Global Matched Filter approach","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"1569180150.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101619S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"7077261","isNumber":"7077262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7077261","xplore-issue":"7077262","articleId":"7077269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7077279,"authors":[{"name":"Amelia Ritahani Ismail","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, IIUM, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Amelia Ritahani","lastName":"Ismail","id":"38253899000"},{"name":"Recky Desia","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, IIUM, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Recky","lastName":"Desia","id":"37085527187"},{"name":"Muhammad Fuad Riza Zuhri","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Kulliyah of Information Communication Technology, IIUM, P.O Box 10, 50728 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Muhammad Fuad Riza","lastName":"Zuhri"},{"name":"Raja Muhamad Daniel","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, IIUM, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Raja Muhamad","lastName":"Daniel","id":"37085526950"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8115-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8114-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7077279","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":187},"abstract":"Mobile robot navigation has become as a challenging problem over the last few decades.

In this paper, we proposed investigate the cognitive mapping algorithm that is been implemented to the mobile robot. This mobile robot will be given some inputs which are horizontal and vertical value and start and goal point and a task which is to move from start point to goal point. Some obstacles are also located in the arena and the mobile robot must be able to avoid any given obstacles to reach the goal point. The performance of the cognitive mapping algorithm is compared with an edge follower navigation algorithm, which is an algorithm for a mobile robot to navigate by following the edges or the wall. Based on the experiments that have been performed the cognitive mapping algorithm can be an alternative way for the robot's navigation systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 4th World Congress on

In this method, features were extracted from Android applications byte-code through static code analysis, selected and were used to train supervised classifiers. Using a number of candidate detectors, the true positive rate of detecting malicious code is maximized, while the false positive rate of wrongful detection is minimized.

Moreover, power consumption is also moderate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high speed bit plane coder for JPEG 2000 and it's FPGA implementation","publicationTitle":"2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7077261/7077262/07077347.pdf","startPage":"2231","endPage":"2234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7077347","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7077347/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A high speed bit plane coder for JPEG 2000 and it's FPGA implementation","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7077347/","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"15036252","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high speed bit plane coder for JPEG 2000 and it's FPGA implementation","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"1569184656.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079164S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"7077261","isNumber":"7077262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7077261","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7077262","articleId":"7077347","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7077349,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Mehlf\u00fchrer","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Radio-Frequency Engineering, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Mehlf\u00fchrer","id":"37296855600"},{"name":"Martin Wrulich","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Radio-Frequency Engineering, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Wrulich","id":"37395809100"},{"name":"Josep Colom Ikuno","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Radio-Frequency Engineering, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Josep Colom","lastName":"Ikuno","id":"37704553600"},{"name":"Dagmar Bosanska","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Radio-Frequency Engineering, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Dagmar","lastName":"Bosanska","id":"37939090200"},{"name":"Markus Rupp","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Radio-Frequency Engineering, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Rupp","id":"37276736700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-161-7388-76-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7077349","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":26,"totalDownloads":1358},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Receivers","OFDM","Computational modeling","Physical layer","MATLAB","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","cellular radio","Long Term Evolution","multi-access systems","parallel processing","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["long term evolution physical layer","signal processing algorithms","UMTS long term evolution","MATLAB based downlink physical layer simulator","single downlink cellular radio","single cellular radio","multiuser system","multicellular radio system","parallel computing toolbox"]}],"abstract":"Research and development of signal processing algorithms for UMTS Long Term Evolution (LTE) requires a realistic, flexible, and standard-compliant simulation environment.

We also measure the performance of the equalizer after a low-density parity-check channel decoder has detected the received sequence. Typically, most channel equalizers concentrate on reducing the bit error rate, instead of providing accurate posterior probability estimates. GPC is a Bayesian nonlinear classification tool that provides accurate posterior probability estimates with short training sequences. We show that the accuracy of these estimates is essential for optimal performance of the channel decoder and that the error rate outputted by the equalizer might be irrelevant to understand the performance of the overall communication receiver.

The so-called PARAllel FACtor (PARAFAC) decomposition is certainly the most used tensor tool. In general, the parameter estimation of a PARAFAC decomposition is carried out by means of the iterative ALS algorithm, which exhibits the following main drawbacks: convergence towards local minima, a high number of iterations for convergence, and difficulty to take, optimally, special matrix structures into account. In this paper, we propose a non-iterative parameter estimation method for a PARAFAC decomposition when one matrix factor has a Toeplitz structure, a situation that is commonly encountered in signal processing applications. We illustrate the proposed method by means of simulation results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7077261/7077262/07077557.pdf","startPage":"691","endPage":"695","publicationTitle":"2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7077557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-iterative solution for PARAFAC with a Toeplitz matrix factor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tensile stress","Matrix decomposition","Vectors","Signal processing","Convergence","Signal processing algorithms","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix decomposition","signal processing","tensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noniterative solution","Toeplitz matrix factor","tensor signal processing","parallel factor decomposition","PARAFAC decomposition","noniterative parameter estimation method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7077557/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Non-iterative solution for PARAFAC with a Toeplitz matrix factor","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7077557/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"15036657","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-iterative solution for PARAFAC with a Toeplitz matrix factor","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"1569191300.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088389S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"7077261","isNumber":"7077262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7077261","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7077262","articleId":"7077557","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7077559,"authors":[{"name":"Pascal Chevalier","affiliation":["Thales-Communications, EDS/SPM, Colombes, France"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Chevalier","id":"37265596600"},{"name":"Jean-Pierre Delmas","affiliation":["TELECOM SudParis, CNRS UMR 5157, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Pierre","lastName":"Delmas","id":"37284991500"},{"name":"Abdelkader Oukaci","affiliation":["TELECOM SudParis, CNRS UMR 5157, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Abdelkader","lastName":"Oukaci","id":"37645882500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-161-7388-76-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7077559","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7077559","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Abstracts","Signal to noise ratio","Maximum likelihood detection","Nonlinear filters","Arrays","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","error statistics","linear phase filters","signal denoising","T invariance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal widely linear MVDR beamformer","optimal WL minimum variance distorsionless response beamformer","signal of interest","second order noncircular background noise","SO noncircular background interference","SOl","arbitrary noncircularity properties","signal to interference plus noise ratio","SINR","symbol error rate","SER","Capon beamformer","time invariant complex filter"]}],"publicationTitle":"2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7077261/7077262/07077559.pdf","startPage":"587","endPage":"591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of the optimal widely linear MVDR beamformer","abstract":"This paper presents a comprehensive performance analysis of the optimal widely linear (WL) minimum variance distorsionless response (MVDR) beamformer for the reception of an unknown signal of interest (SOI) corrupted by potentially second order (SO) noncircular background noise and interference.

We consider an over-determined case so that we can form multiple sub-arrays (of which there are as many sensors as speech signals), and propose a novel hybrid scheme to obtain high fidelity speech signals after separation. Firstly, the proposed method applies the commonly-used BSS technique at each sub-array to separate the speech signals. Next, the outputs of the same speech signal from different sub-arrays are grouped to form a new sub-array. We can then exploit the spatial diversity of the new sub-array to achieve high fidelity source separation. This configuration is the key innovation of this paper. Another contribution of the paper is on the justification of using the hybrid configuration to further increase the output SINR. From numerical analysis, it is demonstrated that 12 dB SINR improvement can be achieved using 5-element sensor array in the presence of two other interfering speech signals over a range of input SNR values. A significant improvement can also be seen from the output signal-to-artifact ratio (SAR) of the recovered signals.","publicationTitle":"2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference","startPage":"859","endPage":"863","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077262","pdfPath":"/iel7/7077261/7077262/07077576.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Facsimile","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Abstracts","Irrigation","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","blind source separation","sensor arrays","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high fidelity blind source separation","speech signal separation","BSS","signal-to-interference-noise ratio","SINR","spatial diversity","sensor array","SNR","signal-to-artifact ratio","SAR"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"High fidelity blind source separation of speech signals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7077576/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7077576/","accessionNumber":"15036650","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High fidelity blind source separation of speech signals","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"1569191458.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041911S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"7077261","isNumber":"7077262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7077261","xplore-issue":"7077262","articleId":"7077576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7077590,"authors":[{"name":"Louise H.

In this paper, two FAP algorithms based on the Gauss-Seidel method and using a variable step-size (VSS) are proposed for AEC.

In this paper, the spectral components are estimated by the averaged periodogram non-parametric approach using an FFT. The signals of interest are further processed to determine the type of modulation (single-carrier or multi-carrier). In particular, we develop a parameter estimation tool for ZP-OFDM signals based on power autocorrelation to determine their symbol and zero padding duration.

A likelihood map is built by means of a template matching between the signal acquired at the microphone and a template signal obtained by simulating the propagation of the signal to all the potential obstacles locations. The position of the reflectors is inferred by the analysis of the likelihood map. Simulations assess the best working conditions for the device in terms of test signal duration, radius of the circular trajectory and Signal to Noise Ratio. A simulation has been carried out also in the presence of multiple and interacting reflectors to show the feasibility of the approach also in more complex scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7077681/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7077681/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"15036196","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Acoustic reconstruction of the geometry of an environment through acquisition of a controlled emission","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acoustic reconstruction of the geometry of an environment through acquisition of a controlled emission","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"1569192156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058966S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"7077261","isNumber":"7077262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7077261","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7077262","articleId":"7077681","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7077692,"authors":[{"name":"Di Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Di","lastName":"Wu","id":"37654070700"},{"name":"Johan Eilert","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Johan","lastName":"Eilert","id":"37282012700"},{"name":"Dake Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Dake","lastName":"Liu","id":"37277011300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-161-7388-76-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7077692","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":49},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Throughput","Signal to noise ratio","Detectors","Adaptation models","Vectors","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","automatic repeat request","block codes","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO symbol detectors","adaptive detection","adaptive transmission","hybrid automatic repeat request","downlink multiantenna transmission","MIMO detection methods","3GPP LTE terminals"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates various MIMO detection methods for 3GPP LTE open-loop downlink multi-antenna transmission.

According to this approach, each relay multiplies the received signal by its specific spreading matrix, which is selected as having random independent and identically distributed entries. It is shown that the asymptotic diversity order of this system can vary from 2 to the total number of relays plus one.

First, a FB based scheme, conceptually similar to the single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) developed by 3GPP for uplink in the Long Term Evolution of UMTS, is analyzed. Specifically, a method for synthesizing spectrally well-localized uplink waveforms with low peak-to-average power ratio, using FB based multicarrier (FBMC) modulation in combination with FB spreading, is introduced. Secondly, the superior frequency selectivity of the FB approach, when combined with frequency sampling -designed subchannel/subband processing, is found to enable flexible and bandwidth efficient multi-mode uplink transmission with relaxed constraints on inter-user timing synchronization. The proposed concept allows different mobile terminals to operate in the reverse link simultaneously in multicarrier, SC-FDMA, or conventional single carrier mode according to attributes such as the required transmission power.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Filter bank based multi-mode multiple access scheme for wireless uplink","publicationTitle":"2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7077261/7077262/07077750.pdf","startPage":"1354","endPage":"1358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7077750","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7077750/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Filter bank based multi-mode multiple access scheme for wireless uplink","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7077750/","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"15036648","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Filter bank based multi-mode multiple access scheme for wireless uplink","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"1569192520.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089085S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"7077261","isNumber":"7077262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7077261","xplore-issue":"7077262","articleId":"7077750","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7077751,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The relay terminals are constrained by half-duplex assumption and a limit on the maximum total transmit power. We present two practical link adaptation schemes, asymmetric rate transmission (ART) for single-source and layered space-time ART (LST-ART) for multiple-source scenario. ART adapts the modulation modes and the transmission duration in the two hops separately such that the throughput is maximized. For ease of implementation the transmission duration of the hops are selected from a predefined look-up table (LUT). LST-ART allows for simultaneous transmission from the source terminals to the relay and from the relay to the destination through spatial multiplexing (SM) and it also adapts the transmission duration for each hop based on the combined data rate than can be achieved in that hop. Analytical expressions are derived for average spectral efficiency for both single and multiple source scenarios. From the performance analysis, ART is shown to offer higher throughput compared to that of symmetric rate transmission with fixed hop duration by a gap of 2dB between their achievable spectral efficiency.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077262","publicationTitle":"2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7077261/7077262/07077758.pdf","startPage":"789","endPage":"793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive-rate transmission schemes for two-hop multiple access relay networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive-rate transmission schemes for two-hop multiple access relay networks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/7077758/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"15036544","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7077758/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive-rate transmission schemes for two-hop multiple access relay networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"1569192543.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099043S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"7077261","isNumber":"7077262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7077261","xplore-issue":"7077262","articleId":"7077758","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7077769,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmet Serbes","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Yildiz Technical University, Yildiz, Besiktas, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ahmet","lastName":"Serbes","id":"38190392200"},{"name":"Lutfiye Durak","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Yildiz Technical University, Yildiz, Besiktas, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Lutfiye","lastName":"Durak","id":"37398785100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-161-7388-76-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7077769","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","Chirp","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Matrix decomposition","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","matrix algebra","parameter estimation","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DFT","discrete fractional Fourier transform","chirp signal parameter estimation","eigentransforms","Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization algorithm","eigenvectors","matrix computation"]}],"abstract":"We propose a new discrete fractional Fourier transform (DFrFT) scheme based on eigentransforms of the centered DFT matrix and present its application to chirp parameter estimation problem.

Experimental results show that with this approach performance improvements are introduced with a fraction of design time, reducing dramatically time-to-market for modern diagnostic devices.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architectural exploration in biomedical hardware design using a novel behavioral synthesis methodology","publicationTitle":"2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7077261/7077262/07077793.pdf","startPage":"983","endPage":"987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7077793","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7077793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Architectural exploration in biomedical hardware design using a novel behavioral synthesis methodology","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7077793/","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"15036423","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architectural exploration in biomedical hardware design using a novel behavioral synthesis methodology","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"1569192680.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110758S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"7077261","isNumber":"7077262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7077261","xplore-issue":"7077262","articleId":"7077793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7077805,"authors":[{"name":"Henrique Oliveira","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es - Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Universidade T\u00e9cnica de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal","Escola Superior de Tecnologia e Gest\u00e3o, Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico de Beja, Beja, Portugal"],"firstName":"Henrique","lastName":"Oliveira","id":"37590689000"},{"name":"Paulo Lobato Correia","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es - Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Universidade T\u00e9cnica de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Paulo Lobato","lastName":"Correia","id":"37368835900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-161-7388-76-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7077805","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":987},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7077805","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Roads","Entropy","Image databases","Histograms","Image segmentation","Surface cracks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crack detection","image classification","image filtering","image segmentation","matrix algebra","roads"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic road crack segmentation","image dynamic thresholding","pavement surface distress data collection","human observation","periodic road survey","automatic crack detection","automatic crack classification","morphological filter","pixel intensity variance reduction","entropy block matrix"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077262","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference","publicationTitle":"2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic road crack segmentation using entropy and image dynamic thresholding","startPage":"622","endPage":"626","pdfPath":"/iel7/7077261/7077262/07077805.pdf","abstract":"Human observation is commonly used to collect pavement surface distress data, during periodic road surveys. This method is labour-intensive, subjective and potentially hazardous for both inspectors and road users. This paper presents a novel framework for automatic crack detection and classification using survey images acquired at high driving speeds. The resulting images are pre-processed using morphological filters for reducing pixel intensity variance. Then, a dynamic thresholding is applied to identify dark pixels in images, as these correspond to potential crack pixels. Thresholded images are divided into non-overlapping blocks for entropy computation. A second dynamic thresholding is applied to the resulting entropy blocks matrix, used as the basis for identification of image blocks containing crack pixels. The classification system then labels images as containing horizontal, vertical, miscellaneous or no cracks. Two image databases are used for test purposes, to infer about the method's robustness, one of which acquired using professional high speed equipment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7077805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7077805/","accessionNumber":"15036481","displayDocTitle":"Automatic road crack segmentation using entropy and image dynamic thresholding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic road crack segmentation using entropy and image dynamic thresholding","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"1569192726.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041386S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"7077261","isNumber":"7077262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7077261","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7077262","articleId":"7077805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7077808,"authors":[{"name":"Jani Even","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Jani","lastName":"Even","id":"37294742400"},{"name":"Hiroshi Saruwatari","affiliation":["Nara Sentan Kagaku Gijutsu Daigakuin Daigaku, Ikoma, Nara, JP"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Saruwatari"},{"name":"Kiyohiro Shikano","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Kiyohiro","lastName":"Shikano","id":"37284589100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-161-7388-76-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7077808","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":44},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Signal to noise ratio","Abstracts","Indexes","Hidden Markov models","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","frequency-domain analysis","human computer interaction","microphone arrays","noise abatement","signal denoising","speech enhancement","speech recognition","speech-based user interfaces","Wiener filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial projection","blind signal separation noise estimate","human/machine hands-free speech interface","user voice","microphone array","diffuse background noise suppression","speech estimate","frequency domain blind signal separation","FD-BSS","Wiener filter based postprocessing","diffuse background noise estimation","speech enhancement","word recognition","speech recognition task"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider the human/machine hands-free speech interface where the user voice is picked at a distance with a microphone array. It is assumed that the user is close enough to the machine to be considered as a point source. The noise is a diffuse background noise, created by all the sources present in the environment. The proposed method aims at suppressing the diffuse background noise efficiently without distorting the speech estimate. This method is a modification of a method combining frequency domain blind signal separation (FD-BSS) and Wiener filter based postprocessing. Contrary to the conventional approach, we modify the estimate of the diffuse background noise given by FD-BSS before applying the Wiener filter based post-processing. We also have to build a modified observation using the FD-BSS in order to apply our modified post-processing. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can achieve a better speech enhancement, measured in term of word recognition in a speech recognition task, than the conventional Wiener filter based post-processing.","publicationTitle":"2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7077261/7077262/07077808.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077262","startPage":"1442","endPage":"1446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced wiener post-processing based on partial projection back of the blind signal separation noise estimate","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7077808","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced wiener post-processing based on partial projection back of the blind signal separation noise estimate","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7077808/","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"15036292","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7077808/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced wiener post-processing based on partial projection back of the blind signal separation noise estimate","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"1569192738.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105522S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"7077261","isNumber":"7077262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7077261","xplore-issue":"7077262","articleId":"7077808","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7077816,"authors":[{"name":"Ali N.

Using a combination of leading zero and trailing zero guard intervals to eliminate inter-block interference, jointly optimal MMSE designs for the block processors in the relay layer and the destination are derived under the assumption of channel state information availability across most of the link. This proposed technique is compared to an extension of state-of-the-art block based methods, which are operated back-to-back across the link and may contain an intermittent non-linear detection stage in the relay.

However, recent years have seen the spectrum of languages and techniques splinter in an application specific manner, resulting in an ad-hoc design process which is increasingly dependent on the particular application under development. This poses a major problem for automated tool flows attempting to provide rapid system synthesis for a wide ranges of applications. By analysing a number of dataflow FPGA implementation case studies, this paper shows that despite this common traits may be found in current techniques, which fall largely into three classes. Further, it exposes limitations pertaining to their ability to adapt algorith models to implementations for different operating environments and target platforms.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7077261/7077262/07077856.pdf","startPage":"2688","endPage":"2692","publicationTitle":"2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7077856","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolutionary requirements for next-generation dataflow-based FPGA system design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Table lookup","Abstracts","Dynamic range","Throughput","Production","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic design automation","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","network synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary requirement","next-generation dataflow based FPGA system design","dataflow digital signal processing system","FPGA modelling technique","FPGA synthesis technique","automated tool flow"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7077856/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Evolutionary requirements for next-generation dataflow-based FPGA system design","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7077856/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"15036613","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolutionary requirements for next-generation dataflow-based FPGA system design","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"1569193849.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045492S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"7077261","isNumber":"7077262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7077261","xplore-issue":"7077262","articleId":"7077856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7077858,"authors":[{"name":"Erol \u00d6nen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Eng., Istanbul University Avcilar, Istanbul, TURKEY"],"firstName":"Erol","lastName":"\u00d6nen","id":"37688189500"},{"name":"Ayd\u0131n Akan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Eng., Istanbul University Avcilar, Istanbul, TURKEY"],"firstName":"Ayd\u0131n","lastName":"Akan","id":"37085673905"},{"name":"Luis F.

A particularly promising candidate for next-generation fixed and mobile wireless systems is the combination of MIMO technology with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). OFDM has become the standard method because of its advantages over single carrier modulation schemes on multi-path, frequency selective fading channels. Doppler frequency shifts are expected in fast-moving environments, causing the channel to vary in time, that degrades the performance of OFDM systems. In this paper, we present a time-varying channel modelling and estimation method based on the Discrete Evolutionary Transform to obtain a complete characterization of MIMO-OFDM channels. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated and compared on different levels of channel noise.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7077261/7077262/07077858.pdf","startPage":"1190","endPage":"1194","publicationTitle":"2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7077858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel estimation for fast-varying MIMO-OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Wireless communication","Channel estimation","Time-frequency analysis","Receivers","Doppler effect","Discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","discrete transforms","Doppler shift","evolutionary computation","fading channels","MIMO communication","mobile radio","multipath channels","next generation networks","OFDM modulation","radio links","telecommunication network reliability","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple input multiple output system","fast-varying MIMO-OFDM system link reliability","spectral efficiency","mobile wireless communication system","next generation fixed system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","carrier modulation scheme","Doppler frequency shifts","frequency selective fading channel noise","multipath channel estimation","time-varying channel modelling","discrete evolutionary transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7077858/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Channel estimation for fast-varying MIMO-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7077858/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"15036450","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","conferenceDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel estimation for fast-varying MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"1569197047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062819S","chronDate":"24-28 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"7077261","isNumber":"7077262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7077261","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7077262","articleId":"7077858","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7077864,"authors":[{"name":"Choo Leng Koh","affiliation":["University of Southampton, Southampton, Hampshire, GB"],"lastName":"Choo Leng Koh"},{"name":"Soydan Redif","affiliation":["Engineering Faculty, Near East University, Nikosia, Turkey"],"firstName":"Soydan","lastName":"Redif","id":"37298004900"},{"name":"Stephan Weiss","affiliation":["Dept. of EEE, University of Strathcylde, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Weiss","id":"37276935000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-161-7388-76-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7077864","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadband communication","Decorrelation","Artificial intelligence","Abstracts","Matrix decomposition","Covariance matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel bank filters","decorrelation","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","least mean squares methods","signal sampling","spatiotemporal phenomena"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband GSC beamformer","broadband adaptive beamforming algorithm","least mean square","LMS","broadband eigenvalue decomposition method","spatial decorrelation","temporal decorrelation","filter bank oversampling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7077864","publicationTitle":"2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference","abstract":"Broadband adaptive beamforming algorithms based on the least mean square (LMS) family are known to exhibit slow convergence, if the input is correlated.

Its performance is investigated using OFDM signaling with a QPSK signal constellation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Peak power reduction in OFDM systems using dynamic constellation shaping","publicationTitle":"2005 13th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 13th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7077326/7077327/07077927.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077327","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7077927","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7077927/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Peak power reduction in OFDM systems using dynamic constellation shaping","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7077927/","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"15036759","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Peak power reduction in OFDM systems using dynamic constellation shaping","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"cr1112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032942S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7077326","isNumber":"7077327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7077326","xplore-issue":"7077327","articleId":"7077927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7077933,"authors":[{"name":"Habib \u015eenol","affiliation":["Kadir Has Universitesi, Istanbul, TR"],"firstName":"Habib","lastName":"\u015eenol"},{"name":"Hakan A. \u00c7\u0131rpan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Hakan A.","lastName":"\u00c7\u0131rpan","id":"37347283800"},{"name":"Erdal Panay\u0131rc\u0131","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, I\u015fik University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Erdal","lastName":"Panay\u0131rc\u0131","id":"37344633800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-160-4238-21-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7077933","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","OFDM","Channel estimation","Vectors","Fading","Correlation","Bayes methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","fading channels","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation","series (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency selective fading channel estimation","OFDM systems","linear MMSE","minimum mean square error","channel estimation algorithm","KL series expansion","linear expansion","optimal truncation property","correlation mismatch"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a computationally efficient, linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimation algorithm based on KL series expansion for OFDM systems.

We investigate on the one hand, an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based multiple access scheme (OFDMA), and on the other hand, a multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) scheme. The studies of both transmission schemes are done in a cellular structure. The cellular environment model takes into account path loss and shadowing depending on the position of the mobile terminal. To enhance the performance of OFDMA, we introduce a radio resource management (RRM). Error performances are given to compare the two multiple access proposals. The results show that OFDMA outperforms MC-CDMA at the edge of the cell for low resource loads by using the RRM.

The proposed test statistic is the inner product between two hyperplanes constructed using the nonlinearly transformed template and observations, which becomes a simple quadratic form after applying the kernel trick. To obtain the optimal projections for the template and the observations we maximize the Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) criterion in the feature space. Under the white Gaussian noise assumption, closed-form expressions for the means and the variances under each hypothesis are obtained, and an iterative procedure to get the optimal projections is proposed. Interestingly, the analysis of the results shows that the optimal projections preserve the information about the original waveform shape. This can be used to simplify the optimization procedure since one of the projectors can be fixed in advance. Some simulation results indicate that the proposed test statistic achieves the optimal performance of the linear matched filter under Gaussian noise, but shows an increased robustness against impulsive noise distributions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Gaussian noise","Robustness","Signal to noise ratio","Detectors","Ear"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian noise","impulse noise","matched filters","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["impulsive noise distributions","linear matched filter","closed-form expressions","white Gaussian noise","fisher discriminant analysis criterion","nonlinearly transformed template","high dimensional transformed space","feature space","robust matched filtering"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077327","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2005 13th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 13th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7077326/7077327/07078051.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust matched filtering in the feature space","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robust matched filtering in the feature space","accessionNumber":"15037015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7078051/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078051/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust matched filtering in the feature space","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"cr1294.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049575S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7077326","isNumber":"7077327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7077326","xplore-issue":"7077327","articleId":"7078051","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7078058,"authors":[{"name":"Sara Sandberg","affiliation":["CSEE, Lule\u00e5 University of Technology, Lule\u00e5, Sweden"],"firstName":"Sara","lastName":"Sandberg","id":"37391799800"},{"name":"James P.

The computational cost of the four-dimensional mesh is shown to be lower than that of a bank of second-order resonators producing the same number of modes.","publicationTitle":"2005 13th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 13th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7077326/7077327/07078149.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077327","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial reverberation using a hyper-dimensional FDTD mesh","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078149","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Artificial reverberation using a hyper-dimensional FDTD mesh","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078149/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"15027057","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7078149/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial reverberation using a hyper-dimensional FDTD mesh","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"cr1422.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058323S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7077326","isNumber":"7077327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7077326","xplore-issue":"7077327","articleId":"7078149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7078178,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Philippe Javaudin","affiliation":["France Telecom, R&D Division, Cesson Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Philippe","lastName":"Javaudin","id":"37293776600"},{"name":"Jeremy Lain\u00e9","affiliation":["France Telecom, R&D Division, Cesson Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Lain\u00e9","id":"37085709169"},{"name":"Dominique Lacroix","affiliation":["France Telecom, R&D Division, Cesson Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Dominique","lastName":"Lacroix","id":"37425903300"},{"name":"Olivier Seller","affiliation":["France Telecom, R&D Division, Cesson Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Seller","id":"37269435500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-160-4238-21-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7078178","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","OFDM","Estimation","Resource management","Time-frequency analysis","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","decoding","interference","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inter-cell interference estimation","OFDMA wireless systems","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","multiple access technique","code division multiple access","CDMA","cellular mobile systems","interference estimation","soft-input channel decoders"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) is a multiple access technique that is starting to be examined as an alternative to Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) for cellular mobile systems. Until recently, OFDMA had received little attention for multicellular applications and as a consequence of this, few results are available on the impact of interference on OFDMA communications. In this paper, we study the behaviour of an OFDMA system with respect to the inter-cell interference. We show that due to the heterogeneous nature of the interference, interference estimation combined with soft-input channel decoders can be used to improve the performance of the system. We show through realistic simulations that OFDMA can cope with inter-cell interference even without estimating it. Moreover we evaluate the performance gains obtained for different interference estimation techniques and show that a low complexity algorithm can be used to achieve gains of up to 2 dB.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On inter-cell interference in OFDMA wireless systems","publicationTitle":"2005 13th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 13th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7077326/7077327/07078178.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077327","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078178","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078178/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"On inter-cell interference in OFDMA wireless systems","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7078178/","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"15036831","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On inter-cell interference in OFDMA wireless systems","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"cr1465.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050126S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7077326","isNumber":"7077327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7077326","xplore-issue":"7077327","articleId":"7078178","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7078179,"authors":[{"name":"Shigeki Miyabe","affiliation":["Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma-City, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeki","lastName":"Miyabe","id":"37391457700"},{"name":"Hiroshi Saruwatari","affiliation":["Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma-City, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Saruwatari","id":"37085611563"},{"name":"Kiyohiro Shikano","affiliation":["Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma-City, Japan"],"firstName":"Kiyohiro","lastName":"Shikano","id":"37085614755"},{"name":"Yosuke Tatekura","affiliation":["Shizuoka University, Japan"],"firstName":"Yosuke","lastName":"Tatekura","id":"37888427000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-160-4238-21-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7078179","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":13},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microphones","Loudspeakers","Speech","Echo cancellers","Speech recognition","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","interactive systems","microphone arrays","speech recognition","speech-based user interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["barge-in free spoken dialogue interface","nullspace-based sound field control","beamforming","barge-in free spoken dialogue system","multichannel sound field control","microphone array","loudspeakers","speech recognition"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Barge-in free spoken dialogue interface using nullspace-based sound field control and beamforming","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077327","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2005 13th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 13th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7077326/7077327/07078179.pdf","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078179","abstract":"This paper describes a new small-scale interface for a barge-in free spoken dialogue system combining a multichannel sound field control and a microphone array, in which the response sound from the system can be canceled out at the microphone points.

However, since the proposed method doesn't arrange the control points for the reproduction of the response sound to the user, the user's move is allowed. Furthermore, relaxation of the strict reproduction for the response sound enables us to design a stable system with fewer loudspeakers than the conventional method.

We prove that for a periodic DNA sequence whose length is a prime number the standard approach leads to significant sidelobes in the cross-correlation, the magnitude of which increases with the length of the sequence, while the phase-only approach allows attaining a perfect cross-correlation with zero sidelobes.

The approach we propose operates in three steps. Firstly, decorrelating filtering is carried out along each carrier to eliminate the multiple Access Interference (MAI). Secondly, the fading channel responses, modeled by autoregressive (AR) processes, are estimated by using Kalman filtering. Nevertheless, since the AR parameters are also unknown, one has to estimate both the channels and the corresponding AR parameters. Avoiding a non linear approach such as the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), the method we present is based on two cross coupled Kalman filters. Thirdly, the channel estimates are fed into a frequency diversity Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) rule for channel equalization and symbol detection. The performances of the proposed approach are investigated under realistic Jakes' fading model with slow and fast fading scenarios.","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 13th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7077326/7077327/07078193.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2005 13th European Signal Processing Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077327","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two cross coupled Kalman filters for joint estimation of MC-DS-CDMA fading channels and their corresponding autoregressive parameters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078193/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Two cross coupled Kalman filters for joint estimation of MC-DS-CDMA fading channels and their corresponding autoregressive parameters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7078193/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2017","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two cross coupled Kalman filters for joint estimation of MC-DS-CDMA fading channels and their corresponding autoregressive parameters","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"cr1489.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057052S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7077326","isNumber":"7077327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7077326","xplore-issue":"7077327","articleId":"7078193","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7078199,"authors":[{"name":"R.

SIMO-ICA can separate the mixed signals, not into monaural source signals but into SIMO-model-based signals from independent sources as they are at the microphones. Thus, the separated signals of SIMO-ICA can maintain the spatial qualities of each sound source, and directions-of-arrival (DOAs) of the sources can be estimated after the separation by SIMO-ICA. Owing to the attractive property, the supervised ABF can be applied to efficiently remove the residual interference components after SIMO-ICA and the DOA estimation procedures. The experimental results reveal that the separation performance can be considerably improved by using the proposed method. In addition, the proposed method outperforms the combination of the conventional SIMO-output-type ICA and ABF, as well as both of the simple ICA and ABF.","publicationTitle":"2005 13th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 13th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7077326/7077327/07078226.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077327","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-stage blind source separation combining SIMO-model-based ICA and adaptive beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078226","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Two-stage blind source separation combining SIMO-model-based ICA and adaptive beamforming","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078226/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"15037113","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7078226/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-stage blind source separation combining SIMO-model-based ICA and adaptive beamforming","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"cr1534.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059149S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7077326","isNumber":"7077327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7077326","xplore-issue":"7077327","articleId":"7078226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7078240,"authors":[{"name":"Claude D'Amours","affiliation":["University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, CA"],"firstName":"Claude","lastName":"D'Amours"},{"name":"Naser Salam","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Naser","lastName":"Salam","id":"37085761554"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-160-4238-21-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7078240","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":17},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receiving antennas","Fading","Multiaccess communication","Bit error rate","Channel estimation","Decorrelation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","code division multiple access","code division multiplexing","decorrelation","error statistics","radio receivers","radiofrequency interference","Rayleigh channels","receiving antennas","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiplexed pilots","CDM pilots","DS-CDMA systems","multiantenna receivers","channel estimation","direct-sequence code division multiple access systems","receive antennas","multiple access interference","MAI","bit error rate","BER","flat Rayleigh fading"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the use of code division multiplexed (CDM) pilots for channel estimation for direct-sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) systems with multiple receive antennas.

The vector formulation of the two-dimensional DCT (2D-VDCT) can be implemented in a matrix oriented language and a suitable compiler generates code for the vector architecture. We show in this paper how important speedup factors can be achieved with this methodology.","publicationTitle":"2005 13th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 13th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7077326/7077327/07078364.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077327","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and automatic code generation of a two-dimensional fast cosine transform for SIMD DSP architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078364","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078364/","displayDocTitle":"Design and automatic code generation of a two-dimensional fast cosine transform for SIMD DSP architectures","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"15037170","htmlLink":"/document/7078364/","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and automatic code generation of a two-dimensional fast cosine transform for SIMD DSP architectures","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"cr1793.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039756S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7077326","isNumber":"7077327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7077326","xplore-issue":"7077327","articleId":"7078364","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7078368,"authors":[{"name":"Lucia Valbonesi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL"],"firstName":"Lucia","lastName":"Valbonesi","id":"37273430100"},{"name":"Rashid Ansari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL"],"firstName":"Rashid","lastName":"Ansari","id":"37085672138"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-160-4238-21-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7078368","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":16},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Complexity theory","Vectors","Bit error rate","Discrete Fourier transforms","Probabilistic logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity method","PAPR reduction","OFDM framework","frame expansion parameter selection","erasure pattern selection","EPS","joint BER","reconstruction algorithm","probabilistic schemes"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a low-complexity scheme for PAPR reduction in OFDM based on the Erasure Pattern Selection (EPS) method. EPS has been recently proposed for joint BER and PAPR reduction by using frame expansion in combination with erasures in the OFDM framework. In this paper we discuss the selection of parameters in the EPS method that makes the erasure patterns tight subframes. Based on this selection we develop a low-complexity implementation of the reconstruction algorithm. We compare both complexity and PAPR performance of the proposed scheme with other probabilistic schemes. A key result presented in this paper is that the low-complexity EPS scheme can be effectively combined with existing probabilistic methods to provide improved performance. The combinations have the same complexity of the existing probabilistic methods, but simulation results show a significant improvement in PAPR reduction.","publicationTitle":"2005 13th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 13th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7077326/7077327/07078368.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077327","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity method for PAPR reduction in OFDM based on frame expansion parameter selection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078368","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity method for PAPR reduction in OFDM based on frame expansion parameter selection","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078368/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"15036927","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7078368/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity method for PAPR reduction in OFDM based on frame expansion parameter selection","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"cr1798.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044504S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7077326","isNumber":"7077327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7077326","xplore-issue":"7077327","articleId":"7078368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7078375,"authors":[{"name":"Tun\u00e7er Bayka\u015f","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Tun\u00e7er","lastName":"Bayka\u015f","id":"37298247900"},{"name":"Mohamed Siala","affiliation":["SUP'COM Cit\u00e9 Technologique des Communications, Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Siala","id":"37298260200"},{"name":"Abbas Yonga\u00e7o\u1e21lu","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Abbas","lastName":"Yonga\u00e7o\u1e21lu","id":"37284033600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-160-4238-21-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7078375","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Fading","Multipath channels","Channel estimation","Covariance matrices","Decorrelation","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","channel estimation","decorrelation","error statistics","interference suppression","MIMO communication","radio receivers","radio reception","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO generalized decorrelating discrete-time RAKE receiver","MIMO GD-DTR system","jointly decoding generalized rake receiver","JD-GRAKE","MIMO decorrelating discrete-time RAKE reception","MIMO D-DTR","correlated interference suppression","single antenna generalized RAKE receiver","single antenna decorrelating discrete-time RAKE system","channel estimation errors","diffuse channels","bit error rate"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a generalized decorrelating discrete-time RAKE receiver for MIMO systems (MIMO GD-DTR). The MIMO GD-DTR system is a combination of two other advanced MIMO RAKE reception methods: the jointly decoding generalized rake receiver (JD-GRAKE) and the MIMO decorrelating discrete-time RAKE reception (MIMO D-DTR). The JD-GRAKE has been proposed for correlated interference suppression in MIMO systems and it is obtained from the single antenna generalized RAKE receiver (G-RAKE). The MIMO D-DTR, which is obtained from the single antenna decorrelating discrete-time RAKE (D-DTR) system, improves the performance in the presence of channel estimation errors in diffuse channels. The MIMO GD-DTR combines the complementary advantages of both the JD-GRAKE and the MIMO D-DTR. It suppresses the interference, and takes into consideration the imperfect channel state information at the receiver. Our results show that the performance of the discrete-time version of the MIMO JD-GRAKE could be worse than a conventional RAKE receiver, when there are channel estimation errors in the system, whereas proposed MIMO GD-DTR provides gains up to 1.7 dB at a bit error rate of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2</sup>\n in 3 transmit 3 receive antenna system (3\u00d73).","publicationTitle":"2005 13th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 13th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7077326/7077327/07078375.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077327","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO generalized decorrelating discrete-time RAKE receiver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078375","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078375/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO generalized decorrelating discrete-time RAKE receiver","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"15037226","htmlLink":"/document/7078375/","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO generalized decorrelating discrete-time RAKE receiver","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"cr1819.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045232S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7077326","isNumber":"7077327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7077326","xplore-issue":"7077327","articleId":"7078375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7078376,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Moreover, the additional complexity is moderate, so that the proposed approach is well suited for practical applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 13th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7077326/7077327/07078399.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2005 13th European Signal Processing Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077327","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear multiuser receivers for asynchronous MC-CDMA systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Vectors","Delays","Bit error rate","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","code division multiple access","delay estimation","least mean squares methods","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear multiuser receiver","asynchronous MC-CDMA systems","MRC receivers","MMSE multiuser detector","channel estimation","delay estimation","minimum mean squared error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078399/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Linear multiuser receivers for asynchronous MC-CDMA systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7078399/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"15036842","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear multiuser receivers for asynchronous MC-CDMA systems","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"cr1878.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086211S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7077326","isNumber":"7077327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7077326","xplore-issue":"7077327","articleId":"7078399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7078408,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Molino","affiliation":["CERCOM - Dipartimento di Elettronica, Politecnico di Torino - Corso Duca degli, Torino, ITALY"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Molino","id":"37332322800"},{"name":"Fabrizio Vacca","affiliation":["CERCOM - Dipartimento di Elettronica, Politecnico di Torino - Corso Duca degli, Torino, ITALY"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Vacca","id":"37332322500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-160-4238-21-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7078408","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":28},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Equations","Motion estimation","Registers","Correlation","Computer architecture","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","correlation theory","motion estimation","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CORDIC core","phase correlation technique","motion estimation","phase difference","signal processing algorithm","standard-cell CMOS technology","coordinate rotation digital computer","complementary metal oxide semiconductor","size 25 mum"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes a CORDIC?based architecture to efficiently compute the phase difference between two complex numbers.

In recent years, 3D FR has shown promise to overcome these challanges. With the availability of cheaper acquisition methods, 3D face recognition can be a way out of these problems, both as a stand-alone method, or as a supplement to 2D face recognition.

To evaluate the sensitivity of the decision rule based on this function to threshold variations, a novel strategy is proposed based on the calculus of the partial derivative of the probabilities of detection and false alarm with respect to detection threshold. Results allow us to explain the dependence of the decision rule performance on design parameters such as the prior probabilities, the desired outputs and the signal to noise ratio selected for training (TSNR).

In the first iteration a minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalizer, adapted to the equivalent channel as seen after space-time combining, is used for multiuser detection, whereas for the second and successive iterations a bank of MMSE filters adapted to each user and optimized for the quasi MAI free case is employed.","publicationTitle":"2005 13th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 13th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7077326/7077327/07078493.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077327","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity iterative receivers for space-time block coded MC-CDMA downlink systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078493","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078493/","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity iterative receivers for space-time block coded MC-CDMA downlink systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"15036742","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7078493/","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity iterative receivers for space-time block coded MC-CDMA downlink systems","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"cr2034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039676S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7077326","isNumber":"7077327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7077326","xplore-issue":"7077327","articleId":"7078493","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7078543,"authors":[{"name":"Seyed Hamidreza Mohammadi","affiliation":["Center for Spoken Language Understanding, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Seyed Hamidreza","lastName":"Mohammadi","id":"37711461800"},{"name":"Alexander Kain","affiliation":["Center for Spoken Language Understanding, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Kain","id":"37299575100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7129-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7078543","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":841},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voice conversion using deep neural networks with speaker-independent pre-training","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7066250/7078533/07078543.pdf","startPage":"19","endPage":"23","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLT.2014.7078543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078533","doi":"10.1109/SLT.2014.7078543","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Speech","Artificial neural networks","Accuracy","Speech processing","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","Gaussian processes","mixture models","neural nets","signal representation","speaker recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voice conversion","deep neural network","speaker-independent pretraining","deep autoencoder","speaker short-term spectra compact representation","mapping features","artificial neural network training","target voice feature prediction","source voice features","back-propagation","Gaussian mixture models","frame-selection","conversion accuracy","speech quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["voice conversion","pre-training","deep neural network","autoencoder"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078543","abstract":"In this study, we trained a deep autoencoder to build compact representations of short-term spectra of multiple speakers.

In recent years, cross-lingual acoustic modeling techniques have been employed to overcome this problem. In this paper we propose multiple cross-lingual techniques to address the problem of data insufficiency. The first method, which we call as the cross-lingual phone-CAT, uses the principles of phone-cluster adaptive training (phone-CAT), where the parameters of context-dependent states are obtained by linear interpolation of monophone cluster models. The second method uses the interpolation vectors of phone-CAT, which is known to capture the phonetic context information, to map phonemes between two languages. Finally, the data-driven phoneme-mapping technique is incorporated into the cross-lingual phone-CAT, to obtain what we call as the phoneme-mapped cross-lingual phone-CAT. The proposed techniques are employed in acoustic modeling of three Indian languages namely Bengali, Hindi and Tamil. The phoneme-mapped cross-lingual phone-CAT gave relative improvements of 15.14% for Bengali, 16.4% for Hindi and 11.3% for Tamil over the conventional cross-lingual subspace Gaussian mixture model (SGMM) in low-resource scenario.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustics","Data models","Hidden Markov models","Vectors","Interpolation","Adaptation models","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational linguistics","interpolation","natural language processing","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven phoneme mapping technique","acoustic modeling","low-resource language","data sparsity","multiple cross-lingual techniques","data insufficiency problem","phone-cluster adaptive training","context-dependent state parameters","linear interpolation vectors","monophone cluster models","phonetic context information capture","Indian languages","Bengali language","Hindi language","Tamil language","phoneme-mapped cross-lingual phone-CAT","low-resource scenario"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["phoneme mapping","phone-CAT","cross-lingual","low-resource"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SLT.2014.7078546","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7066250/7078533/07078546.pdf","startPage":"36","endPage":"41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLT.2014.7078546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A data-driven phoneme mapping technique using interpolation vectors of phone-cluster adaptive training","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078546","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A data-driven phoneme mapping technique using interpolation vectors of phone-cluster adaptive training","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078546/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7078546/","accessionNumber":"15033660","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A data-driven phoneme mapping technique using interpolation vectors of phone-cluster adaptive training","confLoc":"South Lake Tahoe, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"0000036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061536S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7066250","isNumber":"7078533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7066250","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7078533","articleId":"7078546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":7078548,"authors":[{"name":"Franti\u0161ek Gr\u00e9zl","affiliation":["Brno University of Technology, Speech@FIT and IT4I Center of Excellence, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Franti\u0161ek","lastName":"Gr\u00e9zl","id":"37064183800"},{"name":"Ekaterina Egorova","affiliation":["Brno University of Technology, Speech@FIT and IT4I Center of Excellence, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Ekaterina","lastName":"Egorova","id":"38227673300"},{"name":"Martin Karafi\u00e1t","affiliation":["Brno University of Technology, Speech@FIT and IT4I Center of Excellence, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Karafi\u00e1t","id":"37697927900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7129-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7078548","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Training","Abstracts","Complexity theory","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","natural language processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ASR","multilingual resources","multilingual training data","multilingual stacked bottle-neck hierarchy","neural network feature extractor","multilingual networks","triphone states","phonemes","multilingual NN training","language variability","phonetic structure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multilingual training","neural networks","stacked bottle-neck","neural network adaptation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078548","abstract":"Multilingual training of neural networks for ASR is widely studied these days.

First, the performance of adapted multilingual networks preliminarily trained on different languages is studied. Next, the effect of different target units - phonemes vs. triphone states - used for multilingual NN training is evaluated. Then the impact of an increasing number of languages used for multilingual NN training is investigated. Here the condition of constant amount of data is added to separately control the influence of larger language variability and larger amount of data. The effect of adding languages from a different domain is also evaluated. Finally a study is performed where a language with the phonetic structure similar to the target's one is added to multilingual training data.","doi":"10.1109/SLT.2014.7078548","startPage":"48","endPage":"53","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLT.2014.7078548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078533","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7066250/7078533/07078548.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Further investigation into multilingual training and adaptation of stacked bottle-neck neural network structure","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078548/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Further investigation into multilingual training and adaptation of stacked bottle-neck neural network structure","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7078548/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15026481","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Further investigation into multilingual training and adaptation of stacked bottle-neck neural network structure","confLoc":"South Lake Tahoe, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"0000048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078606S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7066250","isNumber":"7078533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7066250","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7078533","articleId":"7078548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7078549,"authors":[{"name":"Weiran Wang","affiliation":["TTI-Chicago"],"firstName":"Weiran","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085555943"},{"name":"Raman Arora","affiliation":["Johns Hopkins University"],"firstName":"Raman","lastName":"Arora","id":"38575157900"},{"name":"Karen Livescu","affiliation":["TTI-Chicago"],"firstName":"Karen","lastName":"Livescu","id":"37298968000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7129-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7078549","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Abstracts","Speech","Indexes","Magnetic resonance imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio recording","matrix decomposition","mean square error methods","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["articulatory measurement reconstruction","smoothed low-rank matrix completion","speech science","electromagnetic articulography","recording technologies","time-consuming data source","low-rank matrix factorization techniques","temporal smoothness regularization","Wisconsin X-ray microbeam database","root mean squared error","phonetic recognition performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["articulatory data","X-ray microbeam","missing data","matrix factorization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078549","doi":"10.1109/SLT.2014.7078549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLT.2014.7078549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078533","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7066250/7078533/07078549.pdf","startPage":"54","endPage":"59","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction of articulatory measurements with smoothed low-rank matrix completion","abstract":"Articulatory measurements have been used in a variety of speech science and technology applications. These measurements can be obtained with a number of technologies, such as electromagnetic articulography and X-ray microbeam, typically involving pellets attached to individual articulators. Due to limitations in the recording technologies, articulatory measurements often contain missing data when individual pellets are mis-tracked, leading to relatively high rates of loss in this expensive and time-consuming data source. We present an approach to reconstructing such data, using low-rank matrix factorization techniques combined with temporal smoothness regularization, and apply it to reconstructing the missing entries in the Wisconsin X-ray microbeam database. Our algorithm alternates between two simple steps, each having a closed form as the solution of a linear system. The algorithm gives realistic reconstructions even when a majority of the frames contain missing data, improving over previous approaches to this problem in terms of both root mean squared error and phonetic recognition performance when using the reconstructions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078549/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/7078549/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15026525","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction of articulatory measurements with smoothed low-rank matrix completion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction of articulatory measurements with smoothed low-rank matrix completion","confLoc":"South Lake Tahoe, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"0000054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065183S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7066250","isNumber":"7078533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7066250","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7078533","articleId":"7078549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7078551,"authors":[{"name":"Bing Zhao","affiliation":["SRI International","LinkedIn Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085342313"},{"name":"Yik-Cheung Tam","affiliation":["SRI International, Menlo Park, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yik-Cheung","lastName":"Tam","id":"37636423300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7129-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7078551","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Abstracts","Engines","Artificial neural networks","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["language translation","natural language processing","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical machine translation","SMT","bilingual word-aligned sentences","bilingual recurrent neural network model","bag-of-word representation","recurrent neural network language model","neural network training","target side text","latent semantic analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bilingual recurrent neural network model","statistical machine translation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078551","abstract":"Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have been successfully applied for improved speech recognition and statistical machine translation (SMT) for N-best list re-ranking.

One challenging problem is discovering the word inventory of the language: the lexicon. Lexical clustering is the task of grouping unlabelled acoustic word tokens according to type. We propose a novel lexical clustering model: variable-length word segments are embedded in a fixed-dimensional acoustic space in which clustering is then performed. We evaluate several clustering algorithms and find that the best methods produce clusters with wide variation in sizes, as observed in natural language. The best probabilistic approach is an infinite Gaussian mixture model (IGMM), which automatically chooses the number of clusters. Performance is comparable to that of non-probabilistic Chinese Whispers and average-linkage hierarchical clustering. We conclude that IGMM clustering of fixed-dimensional embeddings holds promise as the lexical clustering component in unsupervised speech processing systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised lexical clustering of speech segments using fixed-dimensional acoustic embeddings","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","doi":"10.1109/SLT.2014.7078557","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7066250/7078533/07078557.pdf","startPage":"100","endPage":"105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLT.2014.7078557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078533","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078557","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078557/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised lexical clustering of speech segments using fixed-dimensional acoustic embeddings","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7078557/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15026550","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised lexical clustering of speech segments using fixed-dimensional acoustic embeddings","confLoc":"South Lake Tahoe, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"0000100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072307S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7066250","isNumber":"7078533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7066250","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7078533","articleId":"7078557","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7078562,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Providing better phonetic context information in the input gives improved performance for DNN. The state projection vectors (state specific vectors) in subspace Gaussian mixture model (SGMM) captures the phonetic information in low dimensional vector space. In this paper, we propose to use state specific vectors of SGMM as features thereby providing additional phonetic information for the DNN framework. To each observation vector in the train data, the corresponding state specific vectors of SGMM are aligned to form the state specific vector feature set. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) feature set are formed by applying LDA to the training data. Since bottleneck features are efficient in extracting useful discriminative information for the phonemes, LDA feature set and state specific vector feature set are converted to bottleneck features. These bottleneck features of both feature sets act as input features to train a single DNN framework. Relative improvement of 8.8% for TIMIT database (core test set) and 9.7% for WSJ corpus is obtained by using the state specific vector bottleneck feature set when compared to the DNN trained only with LDA bottleneck feature set. Also training Deep belief network - DNN (DBN-DNN) using the proposed feature set attains a WER of 20.46% on TIMIT core test set proving the effectiveness of our method. The state specific vectors while acting as features, provide additional useful information related to phoneme variation. Thus by combining it with LDA bottleneck features improved performance is obtained using the DNN framework.","doi":"10.1109/SLT.2014.7078562","startPage":"129","endPage":"134","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7066250/7078533/07078562.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLT.2014.7078562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving deep neural networks using state projection vectors of subspace Gaussian mixture model as features","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Training","Feature extraction","Hidden Markov models","Speech","Neural networks","Acoustics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","hidden Markov models","learning (artificial intelligence)","mixture models","neural nets","speech processing","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep neural networks","state projection vectors","subspace Gaussian mixture model","hidden Markov model-Gaussian mixture model","HMM-GMM framework","phonetic context information","SGMM","low dimensional vector space","linear discriminant analysis","LDA feature set","discriminative information extraction","TIMIT database","WSJ corpus","state specific vector bottleneck feature set","deep belief network training","DBN-DNN","phoneme variation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep neural network","SGMM","bottleneck features","state specific vectors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078562/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Improving deep neural networks using state projection vectors of subspace Gaussian mixture model as features","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7078562/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15026510","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving deep neural networks using state projection vectors of subspace Gaussian mixture model as features","confLoc":"South Lake Tahoe, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"0000129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061996S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7066250","isNumber":"7078533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7066250","xplore-issue":"7078533","articleId":"7078562","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7078563,"authors":[{"name":"Romain Serizel","affiliation":["HLT research unit, Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK), Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Romain","lastName":"Serizel","id":"37681556600"},{"name":"Diego Giuliani","affiliation":["HLT research unit, Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK), Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Diego","lastName":"Giuliani","id":"37352888400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7129-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7078563","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":319},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vocal tract length normalisation approaches to DNN-based children's and adults' speech recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7066250/7078533/07078563.pdf","startPage":"135","endPage":"140","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLT.2014.7078563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078533","doi":"10.1109/SLT.2014.7078563","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Abstracts","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","Context"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cepstral analysis","neural nets","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vocal tract length normalisation approach","DNN-based children speech recognition","DNN-based adult speech recognition","vocal tract length normalisation techniques","VTLN techniques","hybrid deep neural network","hidden Markov model","DNN-HMM automatic speech recognition","DNN-HMM system training","mel frequency cepstral coefficients","normalised MFCC","acoustic features","VTLN warping factors","augmented feature set","decoding","phone error rate performance improvement","relative improvement","children-adult speech mixture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Vocal tract length normalisation","automatic speech recognition","children's speech recognition","deep neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078563","abstract":"This paper introduces approaches based on vocal tract length normalisation (VTLN) techniques for hybrid deep neural network (DNN) -

In this later, novel, approach the warping factors are obtained with a separate DNN and the decoding can be operated in a single pass when standard VTLN approach requires two decoding passes.

This paper explores semi-supervised training of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in a meeting recognition task. We first analyse the impact of imperfect transcription on the DNN and the ASR performance. As labelling error is the source of the problem, we investigate two options available to reduce that: selecting data with fewer errors, and changing the dependence on noise by reducing label precision. Both confidence based data selection and label resolution change are explored in the context of two scenarios of matched and unmatched unlabelled data. We introduce improved DNN based confidence score estimators and show their performance on data selection for both scenarios. Confidence score based data selection was found to yield up to 14.6% relative WER reduction, while better balance between label resolution and recognition hypothesis accuracy allowed further WER reductions by 16.6% relative in the mismatched scenario.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078564/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15033659","htmlLink":"/document/7078564/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Semi-supervised DNN training in meeting recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-supervised DNN training in meeting recognition","confLoc":"South Lake Tahoe, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"0000141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081267S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7066250","isNumber":"7078533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7066250","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7078533","articleId":"7078564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7078565,"authors":[{"name":"Jen-Tzung Chien","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, ROC"],"firstName":"Jen-Tzung","lastName":"Chien","id":"37269128300"},{"name":"Tsai-Wei Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, ROC"],"firstName":"Tsai-Wei","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085538574"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7129-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7078565","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":196},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078565","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Hidden Markov models","Acoustics","Speech","Data models","Speech recognition","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boltzmann machines","speech recognition","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Tikhonov model regularization","deep neural network acoustic modeling","DNN acoustic model","speech recognition tasks","restricted Boltzmann machine","RBM","unsupervised feature learning","structural modeling","pre-training procedure","supervised cross-entropy training"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Tikhonov regularization","deep neural network","acoustic model","speech recognition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SLT.2014.7078565","pdfPath":"/iel7/7066250/7078533/07078565.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","startPage":"147","endPage":"152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLT.2014.7078565","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tikhonov regularization for deep neural network acoustic modeling","abstract":"Deep neural network (DNN) has been widely demonstrated to achieve high performance in different speech recognition tasks. This paper focuses on the issue of model regularization in DNN acoustic model. Our idea is to compensate for the perturbations over training samples in the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) which is applied as a pre-training stage for unsupervised feature learning and structural modeling. We introduce the Tikhonov regularization in pre-training procedure and pursue the invariance property of objective function over the variations in input samples. This Tikhonov regularization is further combined with the regularization based on weight decay. The error function in supervised cross-entropy training is accordingly reduced. Experimental results on using RM and Aurora4 tasks show that hybrid regularization in RBM pre-training improves the training condition in DNN acoustic model and the robustness in speech recognition performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078565/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15026524","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7078565/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Tikhonov regularization for deep neural network acoustic modeling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tikhonov regularization for deep neural network acoustic modeling","confLoc":"South Lake Tahoe, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"0000147.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065077S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7066250","isNumber":"7078533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7066250","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7078533","articleId":"7078565","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7078566,"authors":[{"name":"Ryan Price","affiliation":["Tokvo Institute of Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Price","id":"37085527417"},{"name":"Ken-ichi Iso","affiliation":["Yahoo Japan Corporation, Japan"],"firstName":"Ken-ichi","lastName":"Iso","id":"37283957200"},{"name":"Koichi Shinoda","affiliation":["Tokvo Institute of Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Koichi","lastName":"Shinoda","id":"37556931900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7129-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7078566","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":187},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Transforms","Abstracts","Adaptation models","Context","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","hidden Markov models","neural nets","probability","speaker recognition","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep neural networks","output layers","speech recognition","ONN speaker adaptation","acoustic modeling","context dependent triphone HMM states","CD states","speaker independent network","ONN output classes","phonetic classes","backpropagation","Japanese voice search task"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep Neural Networks (DNN)","Speaker Adaptation","Hierarchy"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SLT.2014.7078566","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7066250/7078533/07078566.pdf","startPage":"153","endPage":"158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLT.2014.7078566","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078566","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speaker adaptation of deep neural networks using a hierarchy of output layers","abstract":"Deep neural networks (DNN) used for acoustic modeling in speech recognition often have a very large number of output units corresponding to context dependent (CD) triphone HMM states. The amount of data available for speaker adaptation is often limited so a large majority of these CD states may not be observed during adaptation. In this case, the posterior probabilities of unseen CD states are only pushed towards zero during DNN speaker adaptation and the ability to predict these states can be degraded relative to the speaker independent network. We address this problem by appending an additional output layer which maps the original set of DNN output classes to a smaller set of phonetic classes (e.g. monophones) thereby reducing the occurrences of unseen states in the adaptation data. Adaptation proceeds by backpropagation of errors from the new output layer, which is disregarded at recognition time when posterior probabilities over the original set of CD states are used. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach over adapting the network with the original set of CD states using experiments on a Japanese voice search task and obtain 5.03% relative reduction in character error rate with approximately 60 seconds of adaptation data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078566/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15026520","htmlLink":"/document/7078566/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Speaker adaptation of deep neural networks using a hierarchy of output layers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speaker adaptation of deep neural networks using a hierarchy of output layers","confLoc":"South Lake Tahoe, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"0000153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099805S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7066250","isNumber":"7078533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7066250","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7078533","articleId":"7078566","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7078568,"authors":[{"name":"Yajie Miao","affiliation":["Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Yajie","lastName":"Miao","id":"37077078700"},{"name":"Lu Jiang","affiliation":["Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085448180"},{"name":"Hao Zhang","affiliation":["Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085440300"},{"name":"Florian Metze","affiliation":["Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Metze","id":"37284940200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7129-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7078568","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":223},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvements to speaker adaptive training of deep neural networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7066250/7078533/07078568.pdf","startPage":"165","endPage":"170","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLT.2014.7078568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078533","doi":"10.1109/SLT.2014.7078568","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Training","Speech","Acoustics","Filter banks","Convolution","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","feature extraction","Gaussian processes","learning (artificial intelligence)","mixture models","multimedia systems","natural language processing","neural nets","sensor fusion","speaker recognition","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speaker adaptive training","deep neural networks","SAT-DNN model","Gaussian mixture acoustic models","GMM","speaker i-vectors","feature learning","word error rates","WER","i-vector extractor training","flexible feature fusion","bottleneck feature generation","BNF generation","convolutional neural network acoustic modeling","CNN acoustic modeling","multilingual DNN-based feature extraction","multimedia data","global speaker attributes","video signals","instructional videos","visual features"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep neural networks","speaker adaptive training","speech recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078568","abstract":"Speaker adaptive training (SAT) is a well studied technique for Gaussian mixture acoustic models (GMMs).

Third, for transcribing multimedia data, we enrich the i-vector representation with global speaker attributes (age, gender, etc.) obtained automatically from video signals. On a collection of instructional videos, incorporation of the additional visual features is observed to boost the recognition accuracy of SAT-DNN.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078568/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15026538","htmlLink":"/document/7078568/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improvements to speaker adaptive training of deep neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvements to speaker adaptive training of deep neural networks","confLoc":"South Lake Tahoe, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"0000165.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05702S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7066250","isNumber":"7078533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7066250","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7078533","articleId":"7078568","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7078569,"authors":[{"name":"Pawel Swietojanski","affiliation":["Centre for Speech Technology Research, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Pawel","lastName":"Swietojanski","id":"38548382000"},{"name":"Steve Renals","affiliation":["Centre for Speech Technology Research, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Renals","id":"37284865700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7129-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7078569","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":94,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":566},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptation models","Acoustics","Training","Neural networks","Data models","Speech","Transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood estimation","neural nets","regression analysis","speech processing","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model-based neural network speaker adaptation technique","neural network acoustic models","unsupervised speaker adaptation","TED talks data","International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation evaluations","IWSLT evaluations","feature-space maximum likelihood linear regression","fMLLR","hidden unit activation functions","sigmoid function","maxout function","rectifying linear units function","ReLU function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speaker Adaptation","Deep Neural Networks","TED","IWSLT","LHUC"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SLT.2014.7078569","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078569","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLT.2014.7078569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078533","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7066250/7078533/07078569.pdf","startPage":"171","endPage":"176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning hidden unit contributions for unsupervised speaker adaptation of neural network acoustic models","abstract":"This paper proposes a simple yet effective model-based neural network speaker adaptation technique that learns speaker-specific hidden unit contributions given adaptation data, without requiring any form of speaker-adaptive training, or labelled adaptation data.

To minimize communication cost, a separate thread running on the GPU host receives minibatches from and sends updated models to the workers, and communicates with the SGD thread via a producer-consumer queue of minibatches. Using this architecture, it is possible to match the speed of GPU-based SGD cross-entropy (CE) training (1 hour of processing per 100 hours of audio on Switchboard). Additionally, we compare different ways of doing frame randomization and discuss experimental results on three LVCSR tasks (Switchboard 300 hours, English broadcast news 50 hours, and noisy Levantine telephone conversations 300 hours).","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7066250/7078533/07078571.pdf","startPage":"183","endPage":"188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A distributed architecture for fast SGD sequence discriminative training of DNN acoustic models","doi":"10.1109/SLT.2014.7078571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLT.2014.7078571","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078571","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078571/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A distributed architecture for fast SGD sequence discriminative training of DNN acoustic models","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15026495","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/7078571/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A distributed architecture for fast SGD sequence discriminative training of DNN acoustic models","confLoc":"South Lake Tahoe, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"0000183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.125204S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7066250","isNumber":"7078533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7066250","xplore-issue":"7078533","articleId":"7078571","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7078572,"authors":[{"name":"Kaisheng Yao","affiliation":["Microsoft"],"firstName":"Kaisheng","lastName":"Yao","id":"37712878600"},{"name":"Baolin Peng","affiliation":["Microsoft"],"firstName":"Baolin","lastName":"Peng","id":"37085449509"},{"name":"Yu Zhang","affiliation":["Microsoft"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085432163"},{"name":"Dong Yu","affiliation":["Microsoft"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Yu","id":"37419739100"},{"name":"Geoffrey Zweig","affiliation":["Microsoft"],"firstName":"Geoffrey","lastName":"Zweig","id":"37298983000"},{"name":"Yangyang Shi","affiliation":["Microsoft"],"firstName":"Yangyang","lastName":"Shi","id":"37085445931"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7129-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7078572","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":82,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1066},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078572","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Recurrent neural networks","Training","Vectors","Semantics","Speech"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","natural language processing","recurrent neural nets","speech processing","word processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spoken language understanding","long short-term memory neural networks","neural network based approach","natural language understanding tasks","word labeling task","recurrent neural networks","RNN","convolutional neural networks","CNN","conditional random fields","CRF","LSTM neural networks","output-label dependence","regression model","LSTM unnormalized scores","ATIS dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","long short-term memory","language understanding"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SLT.2014.7078572","pdfPath":"/iel7/7066250/7078533/07078572.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","startPage":"189","endPage":"194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLT.2014.7078572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spoken language understanding using long short-term memory neural networks","abstract":"Neural network based approaches have recently produced record-setting performances in natural language understanding tasks such as word labeling.

This paper investigates using long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, which contain input, output and forgetting gates and are more advanced than simple RNN, for the word labeling task. To explicitly model output-label dependence, we propose a regression model on top of the LSTM un-normalized scores. We also propose to apply deep LSTM to the task.

However, most previous methods use relatively simple retrieval techniques, resulting in weakness to out of vocabulary (OOV) database queries and inadequate handling of interactions between words in the sentence. To overcome this problem, in this paper we propose a method to utilize recursive neural network paraphrase identification to improve the accuracy and robustness of example-based dialog response retrieval. We model our dialog-pair database and user input query with distributed word representations, and employ recursive autoencoders and dynamic pooling to determine whether two sentences with arbitrary length have the same meaning. The distributed representations have the potential to improve handling of OOV cases, and the recursive structure can reduce confusion in example matching. We evaluate the system performance based on objective and subjective metrics.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLT.2014.7078592","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7066250/7078533/07078592.pdf","startPage":"306","endPage":"311","doi":"10.1109/SLT.2014.7078592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving the robustness of example-based dialog retrieval using recursive neural network paraphrase identification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Improving the robustness of example-based dialog retrieval using recursive neural network paraphrase identification","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/7078592/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15026544","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078592/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving the robustness of example-based dialog retrieval using recursive neural network paraphrase identification","confLoc":"South Lake Tahoe, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"0000306.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07717S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7066250","isNumber":"7078533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7066250","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7078533","articleId":"7078592","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7078593,"authors":[{"name":"Lihong Li","affiliation":["Minicrosoft Research, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Lihong","lastName":"Li","id":"37085354095"},{"name":"He He","affiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"He","id":"37085351167"},{"name":"Jason D.

Learning in this setting is challenging because dialog is a temporal process in which actions affect the future course of the conversation - i.e., dialog requires planning. Past work solved this problem with either conventional supervised learning or reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning provides a principled approach to planning, but requires more resources than a fixed corpus of examples, such as a dialog simulator or a reward function. Conventional supervised learning, by contrast, operates directly from example dialogs but does not take proper account of planning. We introduce a new algorithm called Temporal Supervised Learning which learns directly from example dialogs, while also taking proper account of planning. The key idea is to choose the next dialog action to maximize the expected discounted accuracy until the end of the dialog. On a dialog testbed in the calendar domain, in simulation, we show that a dialog manager trained with temporal supervised learning substantially outperforms a baseline trained using conventional supervised learning.","doi":"10.1109/SLT.2014.7078593","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLT.2014.7078593","startPage":"312","endPage":"317","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7066250/7078533/07078593.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temporal supervised learning for inferring a dialog policy from example conversations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Temporal supervised learning for inferring a dialog policy from example conversations","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7078593/","accessionNumber":"15026528","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078593/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temporal supervised learning for inferring a dialog policy from example conversations","confLoc":"South Lake Tahoe, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"0000312.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050319S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7066250","isNumber":"7078533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7066250","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7078533","articleId":"7078593","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7078595,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew Henderson","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Henderson","id":"38547644500"},{"name":"Blaise Thomson","affiliation":["VocalIQ Ltd., Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Blaise","lastName":"Thomson","id":"37645892300"},{"name":"Jason D.

Most existing spoken dialog systems are designed to work in a static, well-defined domain, and are not well suited to tasks in which the domain may change or be extended over time. This paper shows how recurrent neural networks can be effectively applied to tracking in an extended domain with new slots and values not present in training data. The method is evaluated in the third Dialog State Tracking Challenge, where it significantly outperforms other approaches in the task of tracking the user's goal. A method for online unsupervised adaptation to new domains is also presented. Unsupervised adaptation is shown to be helpful in improving word-based recurrent neural networks, which work directly from the speech recognition results. Word-based dialog state tracking is attractive as it does not require engineering a spoken language understanding system for use in the new domain and it avoids the need for a general purpose intermediate semantic representation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078601/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15026530","htmlLink":"/document/7078601/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robust dialog state tracking using delexicalised recurrent neural networks and unsupervised adaptation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust dialog state tracking using delexicalised recurrent neural networks and unsupervised adaptation","confLoc":"South Lake Tahoe, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"0000360.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050872S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7066250","isNumber":"7078533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7066250","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7078533","articleId":"7078601","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7078604,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Garcia-Romero","affiliation":["Human Language Technology Center of Excellence & Center for Language and Speech Processing, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Garcia-Romero","id":"38331622400"},{"name":"Xiaohui Zhang","affiliation":["Human Language Technology Center of Excellence & Center for Language and Speech Processing, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaohui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085483363"},{"name":"Alan McCree","affiliation":["Human Language Technology Center of Excellence & Center for Language and Speech Processing, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Alan","lastName":"McCree","id":"37078579400"},{"name":"Daniel Povey","affiliation":["Human Language Technology Center of Excellence & Center for Language and Speech Processing, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Povey","id":"37284507300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7129-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7078604","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":527},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speaker recognition","Speech","Conferences","Training","Acoustics","Neural networks","Speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","pattern clustering","speaker recognition","statistical analysis","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speaker recognition performance","domain adaptation challenge","deep neural networks","i-vector speaker recognition systems","Gaussian mixture model","GMM","sufficient statistics collection","DNN","unsupervised domain adaptation task","DAC","agglomerative hierarchical clustering","stopping criterion","unsupervised calibration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Unsupervised adaptation","speaker recognition","i-vectors","deep neural networks"]}],"abstract":"Traditional i-vector speaker recognition systems use a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to collect sufficient statistics (SS).

In this study, we propose an artificial neural network (ANN) architecture to learn a feature transform that is optimized for speaker diarization. We train a multi-hidden-layer ANN to judge whether two given speech segments came from the same or different speakers, using a shared transform of the input features that feeds into a bottleneck layer. We then use the bottleneck layer activations as features, either alone or in combination with baseline MFCC features in a multistream mode, for speaker diarization on test data. The resulting system is evaluated on various corpora of multi-party meetings. A combination of MFCC and ANN features gives up to 14% relative reduction in diarization error, demonstrating that these features are providing an additional independent source of knowledge.","doi":"10.1109/SLT.2014.7078608","pdfPath":"/iel7/7066250/7078533/07078608.pdf","startPage":"402","endPage":"406","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLT.2014.7078608","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural network features for speaker diarization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078608/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural network features for speaker diarization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","accessionNumber":"15026476","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/7078608/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural network features for speaker diarization","confLoc":"South Lake Tahoe, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"0000402.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083239S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7066250","isNumber":"7078533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7066250","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7078533","articleId":"7078608","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7078610,"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Sell","affiliation":["Human Language Technology Center of Excellence, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Gregory","lastName":"Sell","id":"37704854800"},{"name":"Daniel Garcia-Romero","affiliation":["Human Language Technology Center of Excellence, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Garcia-Romero","id":"38331622400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7129-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7078610","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":64,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1506},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Calibration","Density estimation robust algorithm","Principal component analysis","Speech processing","Speaker recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","pattern clustering","sampling methods","speaker recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speaker diarization","PLDA i-vector scoring","unsupervised calibration","unsupervised i-vector clustering","segmented speech","multispeaker conversation","speaker clusters","cosine score","probabilistic linear discriminant analysis","speaker recognition tasks","CALLHOME conversational telephone speech corpus","diarization error rate","DER","denser sampling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078610","abstract":"Speaker diarization via unsupervised i-vector clustering has gained popularity in recent years.

The technique of Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition (LVCSR) is playing an important role in KWS system. However, for a language with large vocabulary and relatively insufficient text corpus, the vocabulary size keeps going up very quickly with the increasing amount of text, as we observed in Tamil. This brings difficulty in training a reliable language model, which may undermine KWS performance. Subword unit has been successfully employed in KWS system to handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem. Inspired by this, we propose a novel subword scheme from the perspective of pronunciation to alleviate the large vocabulary problem. We find that the subword-based system outperforms our best word-based system on Tamil conversational telephone speech. The experiment of system combination shows that, over the best word-based system, a single subword-based system contains more complementary information than the total of that of the other three word-based systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7066250/7078533/07078622.pdf","startPage":"483","endPage":"488","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","doi":"10.1109/SLT.2014.7078622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLT.2014.7078622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078533","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subword scheme for keyword search","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vocabulary","Hidden Markov models","Speech","Training","Keyword search","Speech recognition","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural language processing","speech recognition","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["keyword search","spoken language technology","large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition technique","LVCSR technique","KWS system","large-vocabulary language","text corpus","vocabulary size","Tamil language","subword unit","out-of-vocabulary problem","OOV problem","pronunciation perspective","subword-based system","Tamil conversational telephone speech"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Keyword search","speech recognition","subword","large vocabulary"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078622/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Subword scheme for keyword search","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7078622/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15026490","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subword scheme for keyword search","confLoc":"South Lake Tahoe, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"0000483.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048404S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7066250","isNumber":"7078533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7066250","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7078533","articleId":"7078622","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7078629,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Ali","affiliation":["Qatar Computing Research Institute"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Ali","id":"37085382306"},{"name":"Yifan Zhang","affiliation":["Qatar Computing Research Institute"],"firstName":"Yifan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085395369"},{"name":"Patrick Cardinal","affiliation":["MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Cardinal","id":"37543323600"},{"name":"Najim Dahak","affiliation":["MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA"],"firstName":"Najim","lastName":"Dahak","id":"37085381272"},{"name":"Stephan Vogel","affiliation":["Qatar Computing Research Institute"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Vogel","id":"37283432700"},{"name":"James Glass","affiliation":["MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Glass","id":"37284185800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7129-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7078629","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":710},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Speech","Hidden Markov models","Acoustics","Speech recognition","Dictionaries","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["portals","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complete KALDI recipe","language resources","Arabic speech recognition systems","GALE data","LDC","MADA toolkit","text normalization","text vowelization","phonemes","language model","QCRI language resources Web portal","reproducible sizable training","MSA system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Arabic","ASR system","lexicon","KALDI","GALE"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present a recipe and language resources for training and testing Arabic speech recognition systems using the KALDI toolkit.

The network operates as a self-contained block in a strictly forward-pass configuration to directly generate keyword labels. We call these simple networks causal networks, where the current output is only weighted by the the past inputs and outputs. Since the basic network has a simpler architecture as compared to traditional memory networks used in keyword spotting, it also requires less data to train. Experiments on a standard speech database highlight the behavior and efficacy of such networks. Comparisons with a standard HMM-based keyword spotter show that these networks, while simple, are still more accurate.","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7066250/7078533/07078631.pdf","startPage":"536","endPage":"541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online word-spotting in continuous speech with recurrent neural networks","doi":"10.1109/SLT.2014.7078631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLT.2014.7078631","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078631","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078631/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Online word-spotting in continuous speech with recurrent neural networks","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15026543","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/7078631/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online word-spotting in continuous speech with recurrent neural networks","confLoc":"South Lake Tahoe, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"0000536.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055509S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7066250","isNumber":"7078533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7066250","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7078533","articleId":"7078631","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":7078632,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Zhao","affiliation":["Microsoft Search Technology Center Asia, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085378640"},{"name":"Jinyu Li","affiliation":["One Microsoft Way, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA"],"firstName":"Jinyu","lastName":"Li","id":"37279856000"},{"name":"Yifan Gong","affiliation":["One Microsoft Way, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA"],"firstName":"Yifan","lastName":"Gong","id":"37085380786"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7129-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7078632","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Standards","Vectors","Noise measurement","Speech","Hidden Markov models","Filter banks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","matrix algebra","neural nets","polynomials","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust speech recognition","variable-component deep neural network","VCDNN","context-dependent deep neural network hidden Markov model","CD-DNN-HMM","polynomial functions","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","weighting matrix","variable-parameter DNN","variable-output DNN","VODNN","first-order environment variable","variable activation DNN","VADNN","variable input DNN","VIDNN","hidden layer activation function","Aurora4 task"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["deep neural network","variable component","variable input","variable activation","robust speech recognition"]}],"abstract":"In a previous study, we proposed variable-component deep neural network (VCDNN) to improve the robustness of context-dependent deep neural network hidden Markov model (CD-DNN-HMM). We model the components of DNN a set of polynomial functions of environmental variables, more specifically signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We refined VCDNN on two types of DNN components: (1) weighting matrix and bias (2) the output of each layer. These two methods are called variable-parameter DNN (VPDNN) and variable-output DNN (VODNN). Although both methods got good gain over the standard DNN, they doubled the number of parameters even with only the first-order environment variable. In this study, we propose two new types of VCDNN, namely variable activation DNN (VADNN) and variable input DNN (VIDNN). The environment variable is applied to the hidden layer activation function in VADNN, and is applied directly to the input in VIDNN. Both DNNs only increase a negligible number of parameters compared to the standard DNN. Experimental results on Aurora4 task show that both methods are effective, and VIDNN can beat all other variations of VCDNN with relative 7.69% word error reduction from the standard DNN with the least increase in number of parameters.","doi":"10.1109/SLT.2014.7078632","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7066250/7078533/07078632.pdf","startPage":"542","endPage":"547","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLT.2014.7078632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078533","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable-activation and variable-input deep neural network for robust speech recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078632/","displayDocTitle":"Variable-activation and variable-input deep neural network for robust speech recognition","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7078632/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15026513","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable-activation and variable-input deep neural network for robust speech recognition","confLoc":"South Lake Tahoe, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"0000542.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.141005S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7066250","isNumber":"7078533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7066250","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7078533","articleId":"7078632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7078634,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Guo","affiliation":["Microsoft Research"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Guo","id":"37085400283"},{"name":"Gokhan Tur","affiliation":["Microsoft Research"],"firstName":"Gokhan","lastName":"Tur","id":"37284311400"},{"name":"Wen-tau Yih","affiliation":["Microsoft Research"],"firstName":"Wen-tau","lastName":"Yih","id":"37085401360"},{"name":"Geoffrey Zweig","affiliation":["Microsoft Research"],"firstName":"Geoffrey","lastName":"Zweig","id":"37298983000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7129-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7078634","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":653},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Syntactics","Joints","Semantics","Training","Recurrent neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","neural nets","recurrent neural nets","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint semantic utterance classification","recursive neural networks","slot filling","language processing task","language modeling","paraphrase detection","recurrent neural network language model","feedforward neural network language model","discrete syntactic structure","continuous-space word","phrase representations","core spoken language understanding task","spoken dialog system","RecNN model","Microsoft Cortana conversational understanding task"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Recursive Neural Networks","Dialog Systems","Domain Classification","Intent Determination","Slot Filling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078634","abstract":"In recent years, continuous space models have proven to be highly effective at language processing tasks ranging from paraphrase detection to language modeling. These models are distinctive in their ability to achieve generalization through continuous space representations, and compositionality through arithmetic operations on those representations. Examples of such models include feed-forward and recurrent neural network language models. Recursive neural networks (RecNNs) extend this framework by providing an elegant mechanism for incorporating both discrete syntactic structure and continuous-space word and phrase representations into a powerful compositional model. In this paper, we show that RecNNs can be used to perform the core spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks in a spoken dialog system, more specifically domain and intent determination, concurrently with slot filling, in one jointly trained model. We find that a very simple RecNN model achieves competitive performance on the benchmark ATIS task, as well as on a Microsoft Cortana conversational understanding task.","doi":"10.1109/SLT.2014.7078634","pdfPath":"/iel7/7066250/7078533/07078634.pdf","startPage":"554","endPage":"559","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLT.2014.7078634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint semantic utterance classification and slot filling with recursive neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078634/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Joint semantic utterance classification and slot filling with recursive neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","accessionNumber":"15026531","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/7078634/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint semantic utterance classification and slot filling with recursive neural networks","confLoc":"South Lake Tahoe, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"0000554.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063186S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7066250","isNumber":"7078533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7066250","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7078533","articleId":"7078634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7078680,"authors":[{"name":"Seema Rawat","affiliation":["Assistant Professor Amity University Noida"],"firstName":"Seema","lastName":"Rawat","id":"37085357024"},{"name":"Bhawna Dhruv","affiliation":["M.

However, in a world where digital information is everywhere, finding the desired information has become a crucial problem. In other hand, the users of cloud services starting asking about their privacy protection, particularly when they lose control of their data during the treatment and even some of them think about counting the service providers themselves as honest attackers. For that, new approaches had been published in every axis of the privacy preserving domain. One of these axis consists of a special retrieval models which allow both finding and hiding sensitive desired information at the same time. The substance of our work is a new system of private information retrieval protocol (PIR) composed of four steps the authentication to ensure the identification of authorised users. The encryption of stored documents by the server using the boosting algorithm based on the life of bees and multi-filter cryptosystems. The information retrieval step using a combination of distances by social bees where a document must pass through three dams controlled with three types of worker bees, the bee queen represents the query and the hive represents the class of relevant documents. Finally, a visualization step that permits the presentation of the results in graphical format understandable by humans as a 3D cube.

However, it also introduces new challenges for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and access control of the data. Some approaches are given to ensure these security requirements but they are lacked in some ways such as violation of data confidentiality due to collusion attack and heavy computation (due to large no keys). To address these issues we propose a scheme that uses threshold cryptography in which data owner divides users in groups and gives single key to each user group for decryption of data and, each user in the group shares parts of the key. In this paper, we use capability list to control the access. This scheme not only provides the strong data confidentiality but also reduces the number of keys.","doi":"10.1109/CICT.2015.149","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence & Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence & Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/7076746/7078645/07078695.pdf","startPage":"202","endPage":"207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICT.2015.149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Threshold Cryptography Based Data Security in Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078695","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 Feb. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078695/","displayDocTitle":"Threshold Cryptography Based Data Security in Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"15034852","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7078695/","conferenceDate":"13-14 Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Threshold Cryptography Based Data Security in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Ghaziabad, India","sourcePdf":"6023a202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053949S","chronDate":"13-14 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7076746","isNumber":"7078645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7076746","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7078645","articleId":"7078695","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7078697,"authors":[{"name":"Dinesh Kumar","affiliation":["School of Computer & Systems Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Dinesh","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085494914"},{"name":"Zahid Raza","affiliation":["School of Computer & Systems Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Zahid","lastName":"Raza","id":"37085390304"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6023-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6022-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7078697","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":712},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Vectors","Mathematical model","Equations","Virtual machining","Resource management","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","particle swarm optimisation","resource allocation","scheduling","virtual machines","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PSO based VM resource scheduling model","cloud computing","utility computing","IT industry","elastic on demand resource provisioning","computing resources","cloud infrastructure","virtualization technology","virtual machine scheduling strategy","virtual machine scheduling problem","physical machines","PM","VM placement","VM allocation","physical servers","total resource wastage minimization","worst-fit placement strategy","first-fit placement strategy","best-fit placement strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Virtual Machine Placement","Particle Swarm Optimization","Virtualized Data Center","Multi-dimensional Bin Packing"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing, a new paradigm for utility computing, has brought a revolutionary change in the IT industry by enabling the elastic on demand resource provisioning of computing resources. As cloud infrastructure heavily relies on virtualization technology, there is a need for an efficient and effective virtual machine scheduling strategy. Virtual machine scheduling problem can be defined as an allocation of a set of virtual machines (VMs) to a set of physical machines (PMs). The proposed work focuses on PSO based VM scheduling strategy for VM placement in cloud infrastructure. The strategy focuses on efficient VM allocation to physical servers in order to minimize the total resource wastage and the number of servers used. Simulation experiments were conducted to observe the allocation of VMs to the servers and to evaluate the proposed algorithm with respect to performance and scalability. The results are compared with Best-Fit, First-Fit and Worst-Fit placement strategies. Simulation study conducted to evaluate the performance reveals the effectiveness of the model.","doi":"10.1109/CICT.2015.35","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence & Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence & Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/7076746/7078645/07078697.pdf","startPage":"213","endPage":"219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICT.2015.35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078645","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078697","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A PSO Based VM Resource Scheduling Model for Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 Feb. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078697/","displayDocTitle":"A PSO Based VM Resource Scheduling Model for Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7078697/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"13-14 Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"15034942","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A PSO Based VM Resource Scheduling Model for Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Ghaziabad, India","sourcePdf":"6023a213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076668S","chronDate":"13-14 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7076746","isNumber":"7078645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7076746","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7078645","articleId":"7078697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7078703,"authors":[{"name":"Hou Shujuan","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, P.R.

ICI destroys the orthogonality of OFDM signals and degrades the system performance. Many ICI reduction techniques like frequency domain equalization, time domain windowing, pulse shaping and ICI self cancellation have been developed. ICI self cancellation is an efficient technique in terms of bit error rate, computational complexity. Interference in adjacent subcarriers is self cancelled by modulating the same data on adjacent subcarriers with predefined weighting coefficients. This paper gives a brief overview of various ICI self cancellation techniques based on this principle.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence &

Compared the beam forming and interference alignment transmission mechanism based on fairness relay selection, our scheme can achieve higher system capacity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 Feb. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078715/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15034959","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","conferenceDate":"13-14 Feb. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7078715/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming and Interference Alignment Transmission Mechanism Based on Optimal Relay Selection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming and Interference Alignment Transmission Mechanism Based on Optimal Relay Selection","confLoc":"Ghaziabad, India","sourcePdf":"6023a303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053314S","chronDate":"13-14 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7076746","isNumber":"7078645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7076746","xplore-issue":"7078645","articleId":"7078715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7078721,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Li","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Li","id":"37085522241"},{"name":"Hong Jiang","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37272626400"},{"name":"Yingchun Wei","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Yingchun","lastName":"Wei","id":"37085493293"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6023-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6022-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7078721","dbTime":"31 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":277},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO radar","Direction-of-arrival estimation","Estimation","Multiple signal classification","US Department of Defense","Arrays","Covariance matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","matrix algebra","MIMO radar","parameter estimation","polarisation","radar signal processing","sensors","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DOD-DOA-polarization estimation","large MIMO radar system","random matrix theory","multiple parameter estimation","multi-input multi-output radar system","transmitter sensors","receiver sensors","spatially close angle estimation","multiple electromagnetic vector sensors","multitarget sensors","RMT-based approach","direction-of-departure","direction-of-arrival","2D G-MUSIC algorithms","polarization diversity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO radar","random matrix theory","DOD","DOA","polarization","parameter estimation"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the problem of estimating multiple parameters for large multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radar system in the situation that the numbers of the transmitter and receiver sensors are large that the number of samples could not satisfy the request to confirm that the population covariance matrix would be replaced by the sample covariance matrix. To obtain high-resolution in spatially close angle estimation for multi-target, multiple electromagnetic vector sensors at the receiver are equipped. A novel random matrix theory (RMT)-based approach is proposed to joint estimate the direction-of-departure (DOD), direction-of-arrival (DOA) and two polarization parameters based on two 2D G-MUSIC algorithms. The estimation performance of this paper outperforms that of the conventional algorithms since it has the ability to estimate the parameters more exactly when the number of samples is not sufficient compared with the numbers of the transmitter and receiver sensors. In addition, the exploit of polarization diversity has improved the resolution especially when two or more targets are too close to be distinguished. The simulation results validate the better performance of the proposed method compared with that of the conventional MUSIC algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/CICT.2015.162","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence & Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence & Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/7076746/7078645/07078721.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICT.2015.162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078645","startPage":"334","endPage":"338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DOD-DOA-Polarization Estimation in Large MIMO Radar System Based on Random Matrix Theory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078721","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"DOD-DOA-Polarization Estimation in Large MIMO Radar System Based on Random Matrix Theory","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 Feb. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078721/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-14 Feb. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"15034918","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7078721/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DOD-DOA-Polarization Estimation in Large MIMO Radar System Based on Random Matrix Theory","confLoc":"Ghaziabad, India","sourcePdf":"6023a334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062082S","chronDate":"13-14 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7076746","isNumber":"7078645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7076746","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7078645","articleId":"7078721","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7078722,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Yafeng","affiliation":["Wireless Theory & Technology lab (WT&T), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Yafeng","id":"37293740300"},{"name":"Li Chao","affiliation":["Wireless Theory & Technology lab (WT&T), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Chao","id":"37061532800"},{"name":"Wen Tianwei","affiliation":["Wireless Theory & Technology lab (WT&T), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Tianwei","id":"37061839800"},{"name":"Wei Xiang","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Surveying, University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37396484300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6023-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6022-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7078722","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Probability","Throughput","System performance","Radio spectrum management","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","probability","telecommunication services","telecommunication traffic","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic channel reservation","cognitive radio network","primary user","frequency spectrum handoff","secondary user traffic","system maximum tolerable condition","grade of service","probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","channel reservation","dynamic mechanism","Grade of Service","secondary user traffic"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Channel Reservation for Cognitive Radio Networks","doi":"10.1109/CICT.2015.151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078645","endPage":"343","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence & Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence & Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/7076746/7078645/07078722.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICT.2015.151","startPage":"339","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078722","abstract":"In cognitive radio networks channel reservation has been a branch of deploying more efficient way to the utilization of spectrum. Because of the dominating status of primary users, secondary users have to make room for them when they come. Channel reservation is defined to reserve several fixed channels only for primary users, which will lead to less frequency spectrum handoffs comparing with no reservation mechanism. However, it is a waste of secondary traffic when the reserved channels are not all occupied. In this paper we define a new way to control the number of reserved channels with flexibility so as to enable more secondary user traffic to serve in the cognitive radio networks. We define system maximum tolerable conditions as Grade of Service to judge the performance. Simulation results show that under the same circumstances of the system maximum tolerable probabilities, dynamic channel reservation mechanism works better than fixed channel reservation mechanism by an increase of about 26% traffic gain.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078722/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 Feb. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","accessionNumber":"15034993","htmlLink":"/document/7078722/","conferenceDate":"13-14 Feb. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Channel Reservation for Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Channel Reservation for Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Ghaziabad, India","sourcePdf":"6023a339.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055869S","chronDate":"13-14 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7076746","isNumber":"7078645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7076746","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7078645","articleId":"7078722","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7078741,"authors":[{"name":"Mohd Sufiyan Faridi","affiliation":["Vienna University of Technology, Institute of Photonics, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Mohd Sufiyan","lastName":"Faridi","id":"37085367447"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6023-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6022-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7078741","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":369},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Correlation","Multiplexing","Switches","Transmitting antennas","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","array signal processing","correlation methods","diversity reception","Doppler shift","encoding","frequency division multiple access","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","space division multiplexing","telecommunication switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial correlation based MIMO mode switching","LTE downlink system","MIMO technology","HSPA","3GPP LTE","LTE-A","adaptive switching modes","e-NB","coverage range","OFDMA","4G","channel correlation","Doppler shift","SNR","modulation-and-coding switching scheme","MCS","performance enhancement","spatial multiplexing","open loop","closed loop","transmit beam forming","transmit diversity","Doppler channel","correlation factor","mode switching"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","OFDMA","link adaptation","space-time coding","spatial multiplexing","beamforming","LTE"]}],"abstract":"MIMO Technology is an essential component of HSPA, LTE, LTE-A and its a key technology for LTE where adaptive switching modes at e-NB provides higher throughput for user close to e-NB and broadens its coverage range for user at edges of cell.

To improve the performance of LTE downlink system, this paper investigate the MIMO modes adaptation schemes based on channel correlation, Rank, Doppler shift and SNR etc. 3GPP LTE has defined seven MIMO mode for adaptation and different Modulation and Coding Switching Scheme (MCS) to enhance the performance of LTE downlink. This paper is considering only four modes i.e., Spatial multiplexing for open loop and closed loop, transmit beam forming, and transmit diversity. This paper primarily focuses on how to take spatial correlation into account which also consider the highly Doppler channel for selecting particular MIMO mode.

The method uses the property that for a linear array with uniform element spacing, an inverse Fourier transform relationship exists between the array factor and the element excitations. This property is used in an iterative way to derive the array element excitations from the prescribed array factor. The effectiveness of this method for realizing lower values of side lobe levels and placing the single wide nulls and dual wide nulls at different FFT points will be demonstrated for linear arrays equipped with 34 elements. This demonstration of effectiveness also involves the recovery of the original low-side lobe levels as close as possible, in case of element failures.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence & Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/7076746/7078645/07078748.pdf","startPage":"471","endPage":"474","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence & Communication Technology","doi":"10.1109/CICT.2015.33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICT.2015.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078645","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078748","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Array Failure Correction with Placement of Wide Nulls in the Radiation Pattern of a Linear Array Antenna Using Iterative Fast Fourier Transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Linear antenna arrays","Antenna radiation patterns","Genetic algorithms","Fast Fourier transforms","Particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","fast Fourier transforms","iterative methods","linear antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["failure correction array","single wide null placement","antenna radiation pattern","linear antenna array","iterative fast Fourier transform technique","dual wide null placement","low-side lobe pattern","uniform element spacing","FFT"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna Array","Fast Fourier transform","Array Failure Correction","Low Sidelobe Level","Wide Nulls"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078748/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 Feb. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Array Failure Correction with Placement of Wide Nulls in the Radiation Pattern of a Linear Array Antenna Using Iterative Fast Fourier Transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7078748/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"15034968","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"13-14 Feb. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Array Failure Correction with Placement of Wide Nulls in the Radiation Pattern of a Linear Array Antenna Using Iterative Fast Fourier Transform","confLoc":"Ghaziabad, India","sourcePdf":"6023a471.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059853S","chronDate":"13-14 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7076746","isNumber":"7078645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7076746","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7078645","articleId":"7078748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7078755,"authors":[{"name":"Ramanpreet Singh Chhina","affiliation":["Electrical Department, Delhi Technological University, Delhi"],"firstName":"Ramanpreet Singh","lastName":"Chhina","id":"37085510930"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6023-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6022-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7078755","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Numerical models","Mathematical model","Memristors","Harmonic analysis","Integrated circuit modeling","Resistance","Passive circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonics","memristors","numerical analysis","passive networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memristor","passive circuit element","numerical model","fully symbolic homotopy based model","current time harmonics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Memristor","Mathematical Modelling"]}],"abstract":"Memristor is the fourth basic passive circuit element after resistor, capacitor and inductor.

This paper primarily focuses on generation and distribution parts of the grid. The multiple objectives that are opted for load scheduling are reduction in the electricity cost for the user and maximization of load factor benefitting the user as well as utility. Simulation results show that multi-objective approach proves advantageous in efficient and reliable operation of generating unit while supplying economically affordable electricity to the consumers. Extensive comparison between single objective and multi-objective approach is carried out, which is further justified with two-step and five-step tariff model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 Feb. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078757/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15034953","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7078757/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","conferenceDate":"13-14 Feb. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Consumer End Load Scheduling in DSM Using Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consumer End Load Scheduling in DSM Using Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm Approach","confLoc":"Ghaziabad, India","sourcePdf":"6023a518.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098275S","chronDate":"13-14 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7076746","isNumber":"7078645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7076746","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7078645","articleId":"7078757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7078758,"authors":[{"name":"Nitin Anand","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology (Deemed University) Mesra, Ranchi, Jharkhand"],"firstName":"Nitin","lastName":"Anand","id":"37085532461"},{"name":"Anubhav Sinha","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology (Deemed University) Mesra, Ranchi, Jharkhand"],"firstName":"Anubhav","lastName":"Sinha","id":"37085529985"},{"name":"Chandramauleshwar Roy","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology (Deemed University) Mesra, Ranchi, Jharkhand"],"firstName":"Chandramauleshwar","lastName":"Roy","id":"37085530641"},{"name":"Aminul Islam","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology (Deemed University) Mesra, Ranchi, Jharkhand"],"firstName":"Aminul","lastName":"Islam","id":"37085366270"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6023-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6022-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7078758","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":329},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a Stable Read-Decoupled 6T SRAM Cell at 16-Nm Technology Node","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078758","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["SRAM cells","Noise","MOSFET","Measurement","Monte Carlo methods","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","MOSFET","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stable read-decoupled 6T SRAM cell","single-port 6T SRAM cell","single-ended read operation","write-ability","read stability","pull-up transistors","bitline driver","PMOS transistor","CON6T SRAM cell","read static noise margin","RSNM","write static noise margin","WSNM","size 16 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SRAM","read-decoupled","read SNM","write SNM"]}],"abstract":"This work presents a new single-port 6T SRAM cell with a single-ended read operation (read-decoupled) and shows significant improvement in read stability and write-ability as compared to the conventional 6T (CON6T) SRAM cell.

Our objective is to provide the use of compressed sensing for speech signals which investigates the possibility of reliable reconstruction of a speech signal from very few sample and also to compare the performance of DFT and DCT on speech signal in compressed sensing. Since DCT representation produces comparatively less number of coefficients, it enables a better sparse representation of speech signal than DFT representation. The same hearing quality of speech signal is recovered by DCT using less number of measured coefficients than required by DFT. Since the coefficients of DCT are real, the reconstruction algorithm of DCT runs comparatively faster than DFT and also requires less time for recovery.","doi":"10.1109/CICT.2015.136","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence & Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence & Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/7076746/7078645/07078781.pdf","startPage":"632","endPage":"637","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICT.2015.136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Comparison of Discrete Transforms on Speech Compressed Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078781","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 Feb. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078781/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Comparison of Discrete Transforms on Speech Compressed Sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"15034865","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7078781/","conferenceDate":"13-14 Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Comparison of Discrete Transforms on Speech Compressed Sensing","confLoc":"Ghaziabad, India","sourcePdf":"6023a632.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097148S","chronDate":"13-14 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7076746","isNumber":"7078645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7076746","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7078645","articleId":"7078781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7078785,"authors":[{"name":"Vivek Kumar Agarwal","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology Mesra, Ranchi, Jharkhand, India"],"firstName":"Vivek Kumar","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37085501472"},{"name":"Manisha Guduri","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology Mesra, Ranchi, Jharkhand, India"],"firstName":"Manisha","lastName":"Guduri","id":"37085367661"},{"name":"Aminul Islam","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology Mesra, Ranchi, Jharkhand, India"],"firstName":"Aminul","lastName":"Islam","id":"37085366270"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6023-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6022-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7078785","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":318},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CNTFETs","CMOS integrated circuits","Power dissipation","Logic gates","MOSFET","CMOS technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carbon nanotube field effect transistors","CMOS logic circuits","low-power electronics","multiplexing equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["output waveform","CMOS transmission gate based circuit","energy-delay product","power-delay product","propagation delay","CNFET technology","2:1 MUX circuits","ultralowpower applications","CMOS logic style","power dissipation","deep-subthreshold-low-frequency region","2:1 multiplexer","size 16 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["subthreshold region","power-delay product (PDP)","energy-delay product (EDP)","ultralow-power design","CNFET"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Which is the Best 2-to-1 Line Multiplexer for Ultralow-Power Applications?","doi":"10.1109/CICT.2015.128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078645","endPage":"660","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence & Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence & Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/7076746/7078645/07078785.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICT.2015.128","startPage":"655","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078785","abstract":"This paper first investigates the output waveforms of various 2:1 multiplexer (2:1 MUX) circuits in different CMOS (Complementary MOS) logic styles at deep-sub threshold/low-frequency region at 16-nm technology node.

Based on this model, a 2 DOF control scheme with an H\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u221e</sub>\n robust controller combined with an inverse compensator is proposed for real-time trajectory tracking. The proposed control scheme can maintain system stability and tracking performance in the presence of system uncertainties and external disturbances. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed model and the corresponding control scheme can significantly improve the performance of the rate-dependent hysteresis system.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2015.2413497","startPage":"2432","endPage":"2439","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2015.2413497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7285253","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/87/7285253/07078835.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate-Dependent Modeling and - Robust Control of GMA Based on Hammerstein Model With Preisach Operator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078835/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Rate-Dependent Modeling and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{H}_{\\mathrm {\\infty }}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> Robust Control of GMA Based on Hammerstein Model With Preisach Operator","volume":"23","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7078835/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15520793","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 April 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"91016006, 37714401 and 61433011"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central High Education Institutions of China","grantNumber":"30420111109, 30420120305 and SWJTU11ZT06"},{"fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources","grantNumber":"LAPS13019"},{"fundingName":"High Speed Rail Joint Fund","grantNumber":"U1134205"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate-Dependent Modeling and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{H}_{\\mathrm {\\infty }}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> Robust Control of GMA Based on Hammerstein Model With Preisach Operator","sourcePdf":"tcst-guo-2413497-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092075S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"7285253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7285253","articleId":"7078835","onlineDate":"02 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7078839,"authors":[{"name":"Paul M.

Further improvements can be obtained using nonidentical training pulses, at the cost of requiring measurement of individual conductance during training.

It is demonstrated that FinFETs fail to maintain the performance at scaled dimensions, while VFETs demonstrate good scalability and eventually outperform lateral devices both in speed and power consumption. Lateral GAAFETs show better scalability with respect to FinFETs but still consume 35% more energy per switch than VFETs if made under 5-nm node design rules.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","FinFETs","Performance evaluation","Electrodes","Resistance","Capacitance","Layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","integrated circuit interconnections","MOSFET","oscillators","power consumption","semiconductor device models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS","FinFET","lateral gate-all-around FET","vertical GAAFET","VFET","ring oscillator","lateral devices","power consumption","size 5 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design technology cooptimization","FinFET","nanowire (NW)","scaling","vertical gate-all-around FET (VFET)."]},{"kwd":["Design technology cooptimization","FinFET","nanowire (NW)","scaling","vertical gate-all-around FET (VFET)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TED.2015.2414924","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/7089329/07078860.pdf","startPage":"1433","endPage":"1439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7089329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2015.2414924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vertical GAAFETs for the Ultimate CMOS Scaling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078860","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Vertical GAAFETs for the Ultimate CMOS Scaling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078860/","volume":"62","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7078860/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15072197","dateOfInsertion":"20 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 April 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vertical GAAFETs for the Ultimate CMOS Scaling","sourcePdf":"ted-yakimets-2414924-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063069S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"7089329","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"7089329","articleId":"7078860","onlineDate":"02 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-06"},{"_id":7078861,"authors":[{"name":"Priyanka Das","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Communication Engineering (ECE), Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore, Bangalore, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7182829/7078861/das-2419221-small.gif","p":["\n\nPriyanka Das (S'15) received the B.

However, unlike conventional relaying, the state of the links between the relay and the primary receiver affects the choice of the relay. Further, while the optimal amplify-and-forward (AF) relay selection rule for underlay CR is well understood for the peak interference-constraint, this is not so for the less conservative average interference constraint. For the latter, we present three novel AF relay selection (RS) rules, namely, symbol error probability (SEP)-optimal, inverse-of-affine (IOA), and linear rules. We analyze the SEPs of the IOA and linear rules and also develop a novel, accurate approximation technique for analyzing the performance of AF relays. Extensive numerical results show that all the three rules outperform several RS rules proposed in the literature and generalize the conventional AF RS rule.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Relay Selection Rules for Average Interference-Constrained Cognitive AF Relay Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2419221","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7182829/07078861.pdf","startPage":"4304","endPage":"4315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2419221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7182829","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078861","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078861/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 April 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Novel Relay Selection Rules for Average Interference-Constrained Cognitive AF Relay Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7078861/","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15364411","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Relay Selection Rules for Average Interference-Constrained Cognitive AF Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-das-2419221-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105383S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7182829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7182829","articleId":"7078861","onlineDate":"02 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7078865,"authors":[{"name":"Mauro Ettorre","affiliation":["Institut d\u2019Electronique et de T\u00e9l\u00e9communications de Rennes (IETR), UMR CNRS 6164, Universit\u00e9 de Rennes 1, Rennes Cedex, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7115198/7078865/ettor-2419261-small.gif","p":["Mauro Ettorre (M\u201908\u2013SM\u201915) was born in Tricarico, Matera, Italy, in 1979.

An azimuthally invariant inward traveling wave distribution is defined over the aperture of a radial line slot array (RLSA) to launch a Bessel beam whose normal electric-field component assumes a truncated, zeroth-order Bessel function. An optimization procedure based on a holographic approach is used for tuning the position and size of the slots of the RLSA. The antenna is centrally fed by a coaxial probe transition. The final structure operates at 12.5 GHz. Full-wave simulations and measurements of the vertical component of the electric field show that a non-diffractive radiation is obtained within a range larger than 12 wavelengths in front of the antenna. The generated Bessel beam presents a stable half-power beamwidth of about 20 mm within this range. The proposed system may open new opportunities for planar, low-profile Bessel beam generators at millimeter waves, Terahertz, and optics.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2015.2419261","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7115198/07078865.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2015.2419261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7115198","startPage":"2539","endPage":"2544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental Validation of Bessel Beam Generation Using an Inward Hankel Aperture Distribution","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078865","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Validation of Bessel Beam Generation Using an Inward Hankel Aperture Distribution","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078865/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 April 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15235805","dateOfInsertion":"01 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7078865/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Validation of Bessel Beam Generation Using an Inward Hankel Aperture Distribution","sourcePdf":"tap-pavone-2419261-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055352S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7115198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7115198","articleId":"7078865","onlineDate":"02 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7078866,"authors":[{"name":"Xiwei Huang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University","School of Electronics and Information, Hangzhou Dianzi University"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/7208914/7078866/huang-small.gif","p":["Xiwei Huang (S'10\u2013M'15) received the B.Eng. degree\n from the Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from\n Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in March 2015.","Since May 2014, he has been with Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China, as an Assistant Professor.

However, false pH detection happens at empty microwells due to crosstalk from neighboring microbeads. In this paper, a dual-mode CMOS ISFET sensor is proposed to have accurate pH detection toward DNA sequencing. Methods: Dual-mode sensing, optical and chemical modes, is realized by integrating a CMOS image sensor (CIS) with ISFET pH sensor, and is fabricated in a standard 0.18-\u03bcm CIS process. With accurate determination of microbead physical locations with CIS pixel by contact imaging, the dual-mode sensor can correlate local pH for one DNA slice at one location-determined microbead, which can result in improved pH detection accuracy. Moreover, toward a high-throughput DNA sequencing, a correlated-double-sampling readout that supports large array for both modes is deployed to reduce pixel-to-pixel nonuniformity such as threshold voltage mismatch. Results: The proposed CMOS dual-mode sensor is experimentally examined to show a well correlated pH map and optical image for microbeads with a pH sensitivity of 26.2 mV/pH, a fixed pattern noise (FPN) reduction from 4% to 0.3%, and a readout speed of 1200 frames/s. Conclusion: A dual-mode CMOS ISFET sensor with suppressed FPN for accurate large-arrayed pH sensing is proposed and demonstrated with state-of-the-art measured results toward accurate and high-throughput DNA sequencing. Significance: The developed dual-mode CMOS ISFET sensor has great potential for future personal genome diagnostics with high accuracy and low cost.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208914","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/7208914/07078866.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2015.2419233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2015.2419233","startPage":"2224","endPage":"2233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Dual-Mode Large-Arrayed CMOS ISFET Sensor for Accurate and High-Throughput pH Sensing in Biomedical Diagnosis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 April 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078866/","displayDocTitle":"A Dual-Mode Large-Arrayed CMOS ISFET Sensor for Accurate and High-Throughput pH Sensing in Biomedical Diagnosis","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7078866/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"15381600","pubMedId":"25850082","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Singapore National Research Foundation Proof-of-Concept","grantNumber":"NRF2011NRF-POCO01-050"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dual-Mode Large-Arrayed CMOS ISFET Sensor for Accurate and High-Throughput pH Sensing in Biomedical Diagnosis","sourcePdf":"tbme-yu-2419233-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07445S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"7208914","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"7208914","articleId":"7078866","onlineDate":"02 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":7078873,"authors":[{"name":"Meng-Lin Zhai","affiliation":["Key Lab of Ministry of Education of China for Research of Design and EMC of High Speed Electronic Systems, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Meng-Lin","lastName":"Zhai","id":"37085422327"},{"name":"Hong-Li Peng","affiliation":["Key Lab of Ministry of Education of China for Research of Design and EMC of High Speed Electronic Systems, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hong-Li","lastName":"Peng","id":"37399783800"},{"name":"Zhizhang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"],"firstName":"Zhizhang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085349597"},{"name":"Wen-Yan Yin","affiliation":["Key Lab of Ministry of Education of China for Research of Design and EMC of High Speed Electronic Systems, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China","Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wen-Yan","lastName":"Yin","id":"37278303000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"7078873","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":550},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time-domain analysis","Equations","Reflection","Stability analysis","Numerical stability","Perfectly matched layers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional perfectly matched layer","CPML","one step leapfrog HIE-FDTD method","hybrid implicit-explicit finite-difference time-domain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional perfectly matched layer (CPML)","hybrid implicit-explicit finite-difference time-domain (HIE-FDTD)","one-step leapfrog"]}],"abstract":"The convolutional perfectly matched layer (CPML) is modified and implemented for one-step leapfrog hybrid implicit-explicit finite-difference time-domain (HIE-FDTD) method.

We first address the advantages of such a modular approach, and we explain how distributed signal processing algorithms make WESNs more power-efficient, in particular by avoiding data centralization. We provide an overview of distributed signal processing algorithms that are potentially applicable in WESNs, and for illustration purposes, we also provide a more detailed case study of a distributed eye blink artifact removal algorithm. Finally, we study the power efficiency of these distributed algorithms in comparison to their centralized counterparts in which all the raw sensor signals are centralized in a near-end or far-end

The transmit array is divided into subarrays of equal length to show some improvements as compared to both phased array and MIMO radar alone. In this letter, a hybrid phased MIMO radar with unequal subarrays has been proposed to steer multiple beams of different gain and unique waveforms towards a particular target. The unequal size and greater length of subarrays give an extra degree of freedom by illuminating the small targets with more focused beams. As a result, the echoes received by the receiver provide better information about the target.

First, fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate the unknown and nonlinear functions. Next, a fuzzy state observer is developed to estimate the immeasurable states. Then, command-filtered backstepping control is designed to avoid the explosion of complexity in the backstepping design, and compensating signals are introduced to remove the effect of the errors caused by command filters. The proposed method guarantees that all signals in the closed-loop systems are bounded. The main contributions of this paper are the proposed control method can overcome two problems of linear in the unknown system parameter and explosion of complexity in backstepping-design methods and it does not require that all of the states of the system are measured directly. Finally, two examples are provided to illustrate its effectiveness.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7182400/07078882.pdf","startPage":"5962","endPage":"5970","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2418317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2418317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7182400","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Observer and Command-Filter-Based Adaptive Fuzzy Output Feedback Control of Uncertain Nonlinear Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Backstepping","Observers","Adaptive systems","Explosions","Vectors","Complexity theory","Trajectory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","feedback","filtering theory","fuzzy control","nonlinear control systems","nonlinear functions","observers","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive fuzzy output feedback control","uncertain nonlinear systems","parametric uncertainties","strict-feedback systems","unmeasured states","fuzzy logic systems","nonlinear functions","fuzzy state observer","backstepping control","compensating signals","command filters","closed-loop systems","backstepping-design methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy control","Output feedback control","Backstepping","Observer","Command filter"]},{"kwd":["Backstepping","command filter","fuzzy control","observer","output feedback control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078882/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Observer and Command-Filter-Based Adaptive Fuzzy Output Feedback Control of Uncertain Nonlinear Systems","volume":"62","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7078882/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15359547","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP140102180 and LP140100471"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61104076, 61174131, 61174033 and 61473160"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014T70620, 2013M541881 and 201303062"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Observer and Command-Filter-Based Adaptive Fuzzy Output Feedback Control of Uncertain Nonlinear Systems","sourcePdf":"tie-yu-2418317-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129106S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7182400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"171","xplore-issue":"7182400","articleId":"7078882","onlineDate":"02 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7078884,"authors":[{"name":"Liangliang Tang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/27/7102802/7078884/tang-2416195-small.gif","p":["Liangliang Tang was born in 1984.

In lots of launching experiments, a big chunk of deposit aluminum can be found on the rail surface at the start-up position of the armature-rail contact area, sometimes, erosion is even emerged. The transition at current ramp-up is mainly related to local degradation of armature. The larger value of maximum current densities at the rail/armature (A/R) interface would lead to armature local temperature increasing rapidly, which deteriorates the material property of armature, degrades the static electrical contact performance, and reduces the railgun lifetime significantly. In this paper, for restraining start-up transition, several influencing factors of armature degradation and melt are studied based on current concentration. Rail resistivity, rail dimensions, armature resistivity, and the shape of current supply are considered and simulated. At current startup, skin effect and induced current are analyzed, which are considered as the direct factors of armature's current distribution. Armature current distribution and the maximum current density are obtained and compared for each factor. Finally, launching experiments are carried out as the same condition with simulation. On the rail surface at the start-up position of the A/R interface, the depositions reflect the current distribution on armature with different factors influence at the current ramp-up. The results of experiments are in reasonable agreement with simulation description.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078884/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7078884/","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15107971","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"43","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Study of Some Influencing Factors of Armature Current Distribution at Current Ramp-Up Stage in Railgun","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education","grantNumber":"20120142120027"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51177055, 51237007 and 51307068"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of Some Influencing Factors of Armature Current Distribution at Current Ramp-Up Stage in Railgun","sourcePdf":"tps-tang-2416195-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073797S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"27","isNumber":"7102802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7102802","articleId":"7078884","onlineDate":"02 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7078889,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongliang Li","affiliation":["LSIS Laboratory, UMR CNRS 6168, FCLAB (CNRS 3539), Belfort Cedex, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7137713/7078889/li-2418324-small.gif","p":["\n\nZhongliang Li received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical \nengineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2009 and 2011, respectively.

Then, the decomposed tasks, models, and information flow of the proposed method are analyzed. The proposed coordinated controller installed between the Energy Internet and MG keeps voltage angles and amplitudes consensus, while providing accurate power-sharing and minimizing circulating currents. Finally, the Energy Internet can be integrated into the MG seamlessly if necessary. Hence, the Energy Internet can be operated as a spinning reserve system.

The architecture is suitable for digital beamforming in addition to offering multiple-input multiple-output capabilities. Essential to its realization is a code division multiplexing technique aggregating multiple signal paths at the analog front end into a single analog-to-digital converter. As a result, a significant hardware reduction and a higher power efficiency are achieved when compared with the conventional digital beamforming techniques. In this paper, we examine the system's performance with different types of spreading codes, both orthogonal and nonorthogonal, namely Walsh-Hadamard and Gold codes. Bit error rate calculations show that Walsh-Hadamard codes outperform Gold codes in achieving higher dynamic range with less signal-to-noise ratio degradation, assuming a perfectly synchronous system.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2419195","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7042252/07078894.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7042252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2419195","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","startPage":"260","endPage":"273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code Optimization for a Code-Modulated RF Front End","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078894","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Code Optimization for a Code-Modulated RF Front End","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078894/","volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7078894/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2015","accessionNumber":"15056008","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research, Arlington, VA, USA","grantNumber":"N00014-13-1-0495"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Code Optimization for a Code-Modulated RF Front End","sourcePdf":"access-alwan-2419195-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.237957S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7042252","articleId":"7078894","onlineDate":"02 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7078895,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Chen","affiliation":["Microwave Photonics Research Laboratory, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Xiang Chen (S'13) received the B.Eng. degree in communications\n engineering from the Donghua University, Shanghai, China, in 2009, and the M.Sc. degree in communications and\n information engineering from Shanghai University, Shanghai, in 2012.

At the transmitter, a continuous-wave light wave is amplitude- and phase-modulated by two microwave vector signals carried by a microwave carrier at an identical frequency. The modulated optical signal is polarization multiplexed with an unmodulated optical carrier and transmitted over a length of a single-mode fiber (SMF). At the receiver, the optical signal is detected coherently by a coherent receiver to which a local oscillator (LO) laser source is also applied. Through advanced digital signal processing, the microwave vector signals are recovered, and the phase noise introduced by both the transmitter laser source and LO laser source is cancelled. An experiment is performed. The transmission of a 2.5-Gb/s 16-QAM and a 1.25-Gb/s QPSK microwave vector signals both at 2.5 GHz over a 25-km SMF is implemented. The total bit rate of the MPL is 3.75 Gb/s. The transmission performance of the MPL in terms of error vector magnitudes and bit error rates is evaluated.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7156191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2419456","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7156191/07078895.pdf","startPage":"3091","endPage":"3097","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2419456","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High Spectral Efficiency Coherent Microwave Photonic Link Employing Both Amplitude and Phase Modulation With Digital Phase Noise Cancellation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July15, 15 2015","displayDocTitle":"A High Spectral Efficiency Coherent Microwave Photonic Link Employing Both Amplitude and Phase Modulation With Digital Phase Noise Cancellation","volume":"33","issue":"14","htmlLink":"/document/7078895/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"15 July15, 2015","accessionNumber":"15292257","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078895/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High Spectral Efficiency Coherent Microwave Photonic Link Employing Both Amplitude and Phase Modulation With Digital Phase Noise Cancellation","sourcePdf":"jlt-yao-2419456-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056361S","chronDate":"July15, 15 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7156191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7156191","articleId":"7078895","onlineDate":"02 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7078900,"authors":[{"name":"Ganesh Krishnamoorthy","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/7112232/7078900/krish-2307632-small.gif","p":["\nGanesh Krishnamoorthy received the B.E. degree in mechanical engineering \nfrom Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute, University of Mumbai, Mumbai, India, in 2002 and the M.S.E. and Ph.D. \ndegrees in mechanical engineering from The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA, in 2005 and 2010, \nrespectively.","He is currently with the General Electric Global Research Center, Niskayuna, NY, USA.

This paper describes a methodology using Bayesian networks to distinguish between sensor and process faults as well as faults involving multiple sensors or processes. A review of existing methodologies is presented first, followed by a description of the sensor/process fault detection and isolation (SPFDI) algorithm, its limitations and corresponding mitigating strategies. Discussions are also provided on the potential for false alarms and real-time updates of the system model based on validated sensor data. Factors that affect the algorithm such as the effect of network structure, sensor characteristics, effect of discretization, etc., are discussed. This is followed by details of implementation of the algorithm on an electromechanical actuator (EMA) test bed.","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2014.2307632","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/7112232/07078900.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2014.2307632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7112232","startPage":"335","endPage":"349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous Sensor and Process Fault Detection and Isolation in Multiple-Input\u2013Multiple-Output Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078900","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous Sensor and Process Fault Detection and Isolation in Multiple-Input\u2013Multiple-Output Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078900/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 April 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15144461","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7078900/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N000140910427"},{"fundingName":"Department of Energy through the University Research Program in Robotics","grantNumber":"DE-FG52-004NA2559"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous Sensor and Process Fault Detection and Isolation in Multiple-Input\u2013Multiple-Output Systems","sourcePdf":"jsyst-ashok-2307632-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.254678S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"7112232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7112232","articleId":"7078900","onlineDate":"02 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7078902,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This paper aims to maximize the transmission capacity of the femtocell networks while guaranteeing that the interference experienced at the macro base station does not exceed an interference constraint. We formulate a Bayesian Stackelberg game to model and analyze behaviors of macrocell and femtocell base stations (MBS and FBSs, respectively). In this game, the MBS is the leader, whereas the FBSs are the followers. The channel information between an FBS and its associated femtocell user is private information and is considered the type of the follower. The leader issues the price of interference charged to the followers first to maximize its own profit. Based on the price, the followers decide the strategies to maximize their payoffs defined as the difference between the transmission capacity and the cost of interference (CoI) paid to the leader. Using backward induction, we first analyze the follower game. The existence and uniqueness of the Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE) are examined, and the methods to obtain the BNE for a symmetric case are provided. Then, the leader game is analyzed.

In this paper, we investigate the origin of high spin-torque efficiency and give a phenomenological theory to describe the critical current reduction due to the subvolume activation. Based on various physical theories and structural parameters, a compact model of nanoscale MTJ is developed and demonstrates a satisfactory agreement with experimental results.

However, its one-dimensional (1-D) randomness inherently introduces large coherent aliasing artefacts along the undersampled direction in the reconstruction and, thus, degrades the image quality. This paper proposes a novel reconstruction scheme to reduce the 1-D undersampling-induced aliasing artefacts. Methods: The proposed reconstruction progress is separated into two steps in our new algorithm. In step one, we transfer the original two-dimensional (2-D) image reconstruction into a parallel 1-D signal reconstruction procedure, which takes advantage of the superior incoherence property in the phase direction. In step two, using the new k-space data obtained from the 1-D reconstructions, we implement a follow-up 2-D CS reconstruction to produce a better solution, which exploits the inherent correlations between the adjacent lines of 1-D reconstructed signals. Results: We evaluated the performance on various cases of typical MR images, including cardiac cine, brain, foot, and angiogram at the reduction factor up to 10 and compared the results with the conventional CS method. Experiments using the proposed method demonstrated faithful reconstruction of the MR images. Conclusion: Compared with conventional method, the new method achieves more accurate reconstruction results with 2-5 dB gain in peak SNR and higher structural similarity index. Significance: The proposed method improves image quality of the reconstructions and suppresses the coherent artefacts introduced by the random phase-encode undersampling.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/7208914/07078916.pdf","startPage":"2215","endPage":"2223","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2015.2419372","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2015.2419372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208914","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aliasing Artefact Suppression in Compressed Sensing MRI for Random Phase-Encode Undersampling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Magnetic resonance imaging","Discrete Fourier transforms","Foot","Sparse matrices","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","brain","cardiology","compressed sensing","image coding","image reconstruction","image sampling","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aliasing artefact suppression","compressed sensing MRI","random phase-encode undersampling","Cartesian k-space trajectories","one-dimensional randomness","image quality","1D undersampling-induced aliasing artefacts","original two-dimensional image reconstruction","parallel 1D signal reconstruction procedure","superior incoherence property","phase direction","k-space data","1D reconstructed signals","cardiac cine","brain","foot","angiogram","reduction factor","conventional CS method","higher structural similarity index"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed Sensing","Stationary MRI","Random phase-encode undersampling","Aliasing Artefact Suppression"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Artifacts","Brain","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Phantoms, Imaging"]},{"kwd":["Aliasing artefact suppression","compressed sensing","random phase-encode undersampling","stationary MRI"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Aliasing Artefact Suppression in Compressed Sensing MRI for Random Phase-Encode Undersampling","volume":"62","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7078916/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15381609","pubMedId":"25850083","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61372024"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aliasing Artefact Suppression in Compressed Sensing MRI for Random Phase-Encode Undersampling","sourcePdf":"tbme-liu-2419372-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.163806S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"7208914","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7208914","articleId":"7078916","onlineDate":"02 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7078918,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaolin Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/7110649/7078918/xu-2418288-small.gif","p":["Xiaolin Xu (S\u201915) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2008 and 2011, respectively.

The PUF studied in this paper utilizes the variation sensitivity of static random access memory (SRAM) data retention voltage (DRV), the minimum voltage at which each cell can retain state. Prior work shows that DRV can uniquely identify circuit instances with 28% greater success than SRAM power-up states that are used in PUFs [1]. However, DRV is highly sensitive to temperature, and until now this makes it unreliable and unsuitable for use in a PUF. In this paper, we enable DRV PUFs by proposing a DRV-based hash function that is insensitive to temperature. The new hash function, denoted DRV-based hashing (DH), is reliable across temperatures because it utilizes the temperature-insensitive ordering of DRVs across cells, instead of using the DRVs in absolute terms. To evaluate the security and performance of the DRV PUF, we use DRV measurements from commercially available SRAM chips, and use data from a novel DRV prediction algorithm. The prediction algorithm uses machine learning for fast and accurate simulation-free estimation of any cell's DRV, and the prediction error in comparison to circuit simulation has a standard deviation of 0.35 mV. We demonstrate the DRV PUF using two applications-secret key generation and identification.

Wearable devices enables gait to be measured in naturalistic environments, however questions remain regarding validity. Previous research suggests that when compared with a laboratory reference, measurement accuracy is acceptable for mean but not variability or asymmetry gait characteristics. Some fundamental reasons for this have been presented, (e.g., synchronization, different sampling frequencies) but to date this has not been systematically examined. The aims of this study were to: 1) quantify a comprehensive range of gait characteristics measured using a single triaxial accelerometer-based monitor; 2) examine outcomes and monitor performance in measuring gait in older adults and those with Parkinson's disease (PD); and 3) carry out a detailed comparison with those derived from an instrumented walkway to account for any discrepancies. Fourteen gait characteristics were quantified in 30 people with incident PD and 30 healthy age-matched controls. Of the 14 gait characteristics compared, agreement between instruments was excellent for four (ICCs 0.913-0.983); moderate for four (ICCs 0.508-0.766); and poor for six characteristics (ICCs 0.637-0.370). Further analysis revealed that differences reflect an increased sensitivity of accelerometry to detect motion, rather than measurement error. This is most likely because accelerometry measures gait as a continuous activity rather than discrete footfall events, per instrumented tools. The increased sensitivity shown for these characteristics will be of particular interest to researchers keen to interpret \u201creal-world\u201d gait data. In conclusion, use of a body-worn monitor is recommended for the measurement of gait but is likely to yield more sensitive data for asymmetry and variability features.","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2015.2419317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7466866","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2015.2419317","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221020/7466866/07078919.pdf","startPage":"838","endPage":"847","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Validation of an Accelerometer to Quantify a Comprehensive Battery of Gait Characteristics in Healthy Older Adults and Parkinson's Disease: Toward Clinical and at Home Use","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Validation of an Accelerometer to Quantify a Comprehensive Battery of Gait Characteristics in Healthy Older Adults and Parkinson's Disease: Toward Clinical and at Home Use","volume":"20","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7078919/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"15985589","pubMedId":"25850097","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078919/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000272","fundingName":"National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)"},{"fundingName":"Newcastle Biomedical Research Unit"},{"fundingName":"Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000774","fundingName":"Newcastle University"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004330","fundingName":"GlaxoSmithKline"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Validation of an Accelerometer to Quantify a Comprehensive Battery of Gait Characteristics in Healthy Older Adults and Parkinson's Disease: Toward Clinical and at Home Use","sourcePdf":"jbhi-deldin-2419317-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149392S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"7466866","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"144","xplore-issue":"7466866","articleId":"7078919","onlineDate":"02 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7078921,"authors":[{"name":"Wei He","affiliation":["School of Automation and Electrical Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7406788/7078921/he-2411285-small.gif","p":["Wei He (S\u201909\u2013M\u201912) received the B.Eng. degree in automatic control from the College of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore, in 2006 and 2011, respectively.","From 2011 to 2012, he joined the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, NUS, as a Research Fellow.

The Moore-Penrose inverse term is employed in order to prevent the violation of the full-state constraints.

The control performance of the closed-loop system is guaranteed by appropriately choosing the design parameters.

In this paper, we consider a path-selection-based multihop decode-and-forward (DF) cooperative system. A simple parallel multihop path-based cooperative communication system is considered. It is assumed that all hops in all cooperative paths are subject to independent Rayleigh fading. The best path, that is, the best multihop link between the source and the destination, is selected based on the max-min selection criterion. The relays in the selected cooperative path use the symbol-wise DF protocol, in which they demodulate the received data from the preceding node in a symbol-wise manner and forward it to the succeeding node. An analytical framework is developed for finding an accurate (almost close to exact) error performance of the considered system. To be more specific, we derive an accurate expression of the average bit error rate of the max-min-criterion-based best-path selection scheme, in terms of convergent power series. The coding gain and the diversity order of the scheme are also analytically obtained.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7452700/07078922.pdf","startPage":"2722","endPage":"2728","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2419451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2419451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7452700","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation of Best-Path Selection in a Multihop Decode-and-Forward Cooperative System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spread spectrum communication","Bit error rate","Protocols","Signal to noise ratio","Cooperative systems","Fading","Relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","decode and forward communication","error statistics","minimax techniques","protocols","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","best-path selection","multihop communication","decode-and-forward cooperative system","parallel multihop path","cooperative paths","independent Rayleigh fading","multihop link","max-min selection criterion","symbol-wise DF protocol","bit error rate","BER","convergent power series","coding gain","diversity order"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BER","cooperative communication","decode-and-forward protocol","multi-hop relaying","path selection","performance evaluation"]},{"kwd":["Bit error rate (BER)","broadcast","channel hopping","cognitive radio network","cooperative communication","decode-and-forward (DF) protocol","Langford pairing","multihop relaying","path selection","performance evaluation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078922/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation of Best-Path Selection in a Multihop Decode-and-Forward Cooperative System","volume":"65","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7078922/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15934353","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Department of Science and Technology, Government of India for the Project \u201cPath Selection in Multi-Hop Cooperative Wireless Networks: Algorithm Design and Hardware Implementation\u201d"},{"fundingName":"Academy of Finland under the project \u201cSpectrum Management for Future Wireless Systems\u201d","grantNumber":"133652"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation of Best-Path Selection in a Multihop Decode-and-Forward Cooperative System","sourcePdf":"tvt-bhatnagar-2419451-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068604S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7452700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7452700","articleId":"7078922","onlineDate":"02 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7078929,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7452700/7078929/yang-2419318-small.gif","p":["\n\nNan Yang (S'09\u2013M'11) received the B.S. degree in electronics from \nChina Agricultural University, Beijing, China, in 2005 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from \nthe Beijing Institute of Technology in 2007 and 2011, respectively.","He is currently a Future Engineering Research Leadership Fellow and a Lecturer with the Research School of \nEngineering, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.

We analyze the performance and determine the optimal transmission parameters for two distinct schemes: 1) an on-off transmission scheme and 2) an adaptive transmission scheme. For the on-off transmission scheme, where a channel-realization-independent secrecy rate is used for all transmission periods, we derive closed-form expressions for the secure transmission probability, the hybrid outage probability, and the effective secrecy throughput. For the adaptive transmission scheme, where a channel-realization-dependent secrecy rate is used for each transmission period, we derive closed-form expressions for the secure transmission probability, the secrecy outage probability, and the effective secrecy throughput. Using these closed-form expressions, we determine the optimal power allocation between information signals and artificial noise signals for both schemes to maximize the secure transmission probability. We also determine the optimal secrecy rate for both schemes to maximize the effective secrecy throughput. We explicitly examine the impact of N and M on the optimal power allocation and the optimal secrecy rate. Finally, we demonstrate the performance gain of the adaptive transmission scheme over the on-off transmission scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2419318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2419318","startPage":"2170","endPage":"2181","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7452700/07078929.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7452700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Transmission With Artificial Noise in MISOME Wiretap Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078929/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Transmission With Artificial Noise in MISOME Wiretap Channels","volume":"65","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2016","accessionNumber":"15934381","publicationDate":"April 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7078929/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Australian Research Council Discovery Projects","grantNumber":"DP120102607 and DP150103905"},{"fundingName":"Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development","grantNumber":"102.04-2013.13"},{"fundingName":"Australian Research Council Discovery Project","grantNumber":"DP120102607"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Transmission With Artificial Noise in MISOME Wiretap Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-yang-2419318-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.186164S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7452700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"7452700","articleId":"7078929","onlineDate":"02 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7078930,"authors":[{"name":"Hongyi Li","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Bohai University, Jinzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7406788/7078930/li-2413134-small.gif","p":["Hongyi Li received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mathematics from Bohai University, Jinzhou, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in intelligent control from the University of Portsmouth, Portsmouth, U.K., in 2012.","He was a Research Associate with the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, and Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, in 2010 and 2012, respectively.

One of its key topics has been studied in this paper, i.e., the style-oriented driver modeling for speed control, and a modeling scheme based on distal learning control and real-world vehicle test data (VTD) is proposed to make this possible. The driver model adapts to be an inverse model of the vehicle at run, which is accomplished under the distal guidance of the discrepancy between the actual and the desired vehicle speed. To tackle the divergence and local mutability of real-world vehicle data, the partly connected multilayered perceptron (PCMLP), which is a locally designed neural network, is utilized to fulfill the imitating of human operations on gas or brake pedals during real-world driving. The FTP-75 driving cycles are borrowed to test the established driver models, and driving styles of the original human drivers are retained and reproduced while accomplishing the speed following task. Simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/7277123/07078931.pdf","startPage":"2522","endPage":"2530","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2015.2409870","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2015.2409870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7277123","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Establishing Style-Oriented Driver Models by Imitating Human Driving Behaviors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Biological system modeling","Hidden Markov models","Computational modeling","Roads","Data models","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobile industry","behavioural sciences","intelligent transportation systems","learning systems","multilayer perceptrons","neurocontrollers","road traffic control","road vehicles","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human driving behaviors imitation","automobile industry","intelligent transportation","style-oriented driver modeling","speed control","modeling scheme","distal learning control","real-world vehicle test data","VTD","inverse model","distal guidance","vehicle speed","local mutability","real-world vehicle data","partly connected multilayered perceptron","PCMLP","locally designed neural network","human operations","gas pedals","brake pedals","real-world driving","FTP-75 driving cycles","speed following task"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Driver model","driving style","distal learning control","driving cycle test","VTD","PCMLP"]},{"kwd":["Driver model","driving style","distal learning control","driving cycle test","VTD","PCMLP"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078931/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Establishing Style-Oriented Driver Models by Imitating Human Driving Behaviors","volume":"16","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7078931/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15475160","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100002427","fundingName":"Ford Motor Company","grantNumber":"URP 2012-6043R"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Establishing Style-Oriented Driver Models by Imitating Human Driving Behaviors","sourcePdf":"tits-hu-2409870-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090986S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"7277123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"7277123","articleId":"7078931","onlineDate":"02 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-04"},{"_id":7078932,"authors":[{"name":"Guan-Yu Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7452700/7078932/lin-2418811-small.gif","p":["\n\nGuan-Yu Lin received the B.S. degree from the Departmentof Electrical \nEngineering, National TaiwanUniversity, Taipei, Taiwan, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","He is interested in evaluating systemperformance and designing protocols for wirelesscommunication systems.

Surging random-access attempts cause not only severe preamble collisions but downlink resource shortage as well, thus degrading the performance of the random-access procedure. However, the effect of downlink resource shortage on system performance has yet to be comprehensively studied. In addition, most existing random-access contention resolution mechanisms sacrifice random-access channel (RACH) throughput for a high success probability, and thus, the price is that low-throughput mechanisms need a lot of time to deal with access attempts. In this paper, we evaluate the medium-access-control (MAC)-level performance for the four-step random-access procedure in Long-Term Evolution (LTE) systems, both with and without constrained downlink resources. Furthermore, we propose a novel RACH contention resolution scheme, i.e., the dynamic backoff (DB) scheme. DB can achieve high RACH throughput, yielding a high random-access success probability under various RACH overloaded scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2418811","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7452700/07078932.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2418811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7452700","startPage":"2560","endPage":"2577","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation and Adaptation for Bursty LTE Random Access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078932","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Estimation and Adaptation for Bursty LTE Random Access","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078932/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 April 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"65","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15934336","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7078932/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Chunghwa Telecom Co., Ltd."},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007225","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"102-2221-E-002-077-MY2 and 103-2221-E-002-086-MY3."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation and Adaptation for Bursty LTE Random Access","sourcePdf":"tvt-wei-2418811-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.188177S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7452700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"7452700","articleId":"7078932","onlineDate":"02 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7078934,"authors":[{"name":"Slawomir Koziel","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics, Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk, Poland"],"firstName":"Slawomir","lastName":"Koziel","id":"37270222900"},{"name":"Adrian Bekasiewicz","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics, Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk, Poland"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Bekasiewicz","id":"38233401400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"7078934","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":530},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Reflection","Dielectric resonator antennas","Ultra wideband antennas","Reflector antennas","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["monopole antennas","optimisation","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fabricated prototype","UWB monopole","quasiisotropic dielectric resonator antenna","trust region framework","optimization process","antenna size","optimization technique","trust regions","adjoint sensitivities","antenna structures","EM-driven size reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adjoint sensitivity","antenna design","compact antennas","EM-driven optimization","trust regions"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, a simple yet robust and computationally efficient optimization technique for explicit size reduction of antenna structures is presented.

The constructed optimal RS models consist of only significant regression terms, which were selected by using PSO. Then, a PSO-based multiobjective optimization coupled with the constructed RS models, instead of the finite-element analysis, was performed to generate the Pareto front with a significantly reduced computational cost.

Flexible and efficient frequency reuse is one of promising approaches to tackling interference among femtocells. In this paper, we propose a semistatic intercell interference coordination (ICIC) scheme called adaptive frequency reuse (AFR). The proposed AFR scheme involves two algorithms, namely, primary subchannel self-configuration (PSC-SC), that served as ICIC, and interference-aware resource allocation, that served as intracell resource allocation. Compared with the no-ICIC scheme (i.e., Reuse 1), the proposed AFR scheme can achieve around 100% gain in terms of spectrum efficiency of cell-edge users with a minimal impact on the spectrum efficiency of cell-center users. Furthermore, the proposed PSC-SC algorithm is characteristic of low signaling overhead and fast convergence, which is very suitable for femtocell networks with constrained-capacity backhaul.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7452700/07078940.pdf","startPage":"2413","endPage":"2423","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2418813","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2418813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7452700","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078940","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Mitigation for Femtocell Networks Via Adaptive Frequency Reuse","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Resource management","Femtocell networks","Algorithm design and analysis","Games","Macrocell networks","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","frequency allocation","interference suppression","mobility management (mobile radio)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocell networks","adaptive frequency reuse","interference management","semistatic intercell interference coordination scheme","ICIC scheme","AFR scheme","primary subchannel self-configuration","PSC-SC","interference-aware resource allocation","intracell resource allocation","cell-edge users","spectrum efficiency","constrained-capacity backhaul"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocell","interference mitigation","frequency reuse","sub-channel allocation","interference graph","game theory"]},{"kwd":["Femtocell","frequency reuse","game theory","interference graph","interference mitigation","subchannel allocation (SCA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078940/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Interference Mitigation for Femtocell Networks Via Adaptive Frequency Reuse","volume":"65","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7078940/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15934409","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61231008"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2009CB320404"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61102057"},{"fundingName":"Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University","grantNumber":"IRT0852"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"B08038"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Mitigation for Femtocell Networks Via Adaptive Frequency Reuse","sourcePdf":"tvt-huang-2418813-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155153S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7452700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7452700","articleId":"7078940","onlineDate":"02 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7078943,"authors":[{"name":"Fan Li","affiliation":["Department of Systems Design Engineering, University of Wateroo, Waterloo, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Li","id":"37085359064"},{"name":"Linlin Xu","affiliation":["Department of Systems Design Engineering, University of Wateroo, Waterloo, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Linlin","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085362863"},{"name":"Alexander Wong","affiliation":["Department of Systems Design Engineering, University of Wateroo, Waterloo, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Wong","id":"37286976100"},{"name":"David A.

A novel stochastic polarimetric SAR despeckling technique based on quasi Monte Carlo sampling (QMCS) and region-based probabilistic similarity likelihood has been developed. The despeckling of complex polarimetric SAR images is formulated as a Bayesian least squares optimization problem, where the posterior distribution is estimated by QMCS in a nonparametric manner. The QMCS approach allows the incorporation of the statistical description of local texture pattern similarity. Experiments on two benchmark quad-pol SAR images demonstrate that the proposed QMC texture likelihood sampling (QMCTLS) filter outperforms referenced methods in terms of both noise removal and detail

To realize proximity based services such as mobile social networks and mobile marketing using D2D communications, each device should first discover nearby devices, which have mobile applications of interest, by using a discovery protocol. The proposed discovery protocol makes use of a short discovery code that contains compressed information of mobile applications in a device. A discovery code is generated by using either a hash function or a Bloom filter. When a device receives a discovery code broadcast by another device, the device can approximately find out the mobile applications in the other device. The proposed protocol is capable of quickly discovering massive number of devices while consuming a relatively small amount of radio resources. We analyze the performance of the proposed protocol under the random direction mobility model and a real mobility trace. By simulations, we show that the analytical results well match the simulation results and that the proposed protocol greatly outperforms a simple non-filtering protocol.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2015.2418767","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/7373720/07078949.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7373720","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2015.2418767","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","startPage":"336","endPage":"349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discovering Mobile Applications in Cellular Device-to-Device Communications: Hash Function and Bloom Filter-Based Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078949","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Discovering Mobile Applications in Cellular Device-to-Device Communications: Hash Function and Bloom Filter-Based Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078949/","volume":"15","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7078949/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15689305","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007431","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Korean government","grantNumber":"2014R1A5A1011478"},{"fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007431","fundingName":"NRF"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002701","fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"NRF-2014R1A1A2059187"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discovering Mobile Applications in Cellular Device-to-Device Communications: Hash Function and Bloom Filter-Based Approach","sourcePdf":"tmc-hossain-2418767-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144913S","chronDate":"Feb. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"7373720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7373720","articleId":"7078949","onlineDate":"02 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7078956,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Li","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Li","id":"37085786668"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"7078956","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":368},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose and investigate four amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying schemes for both the primary user (PU) and the cognitive user (CU), depending on whether both users transmit their signals to the common relay in parallel or serially and whether the relay forwards their signals to the respective receivers in parallel or serially. The advantage of the proposed schemes is that both users can share the same relay, which is different from previous works. Our goal is to minimize the normalized total power consumption while guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) of both users and their individual transmit power constraints. Based on the feasible conditions for the optimization problem (OP), we define a new performance metric called relay sharing (RS) probability to characterize proposed schemes and derive closed-form expressions for asymptotically tight approximation and exact performance analysis.

While most of the existing works in literature consider continuous transmit power, in practical systems such as 3GPP LTE networks, the downlink transmit power is quantized into discrete levels. Moreover, how to apply those power control schemes into such systems is not specified, so one can consider a simple rounding scheme, however, the optimality, convergence, and uniqueness may not be preserved. Therefore, in this letter, we propose a distributed resource allocation for energy efficiency in multi-cell wireless networks, considering discrete power control. We formulate the problem as a fractional discrete optimization problem, show its NP-hardness, and propose a suboptimal polynomial time solution by exploiting the convenience of non-linear fractional programming. The algorithm is executed before each transmission interval, and in each iteration, each base station first assigns the user for the radio resource and then updates the transmit power using a randomized procedure. Simulations are provided to evaluate the convergence and advantages of the proposed algorithm.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Resource management","Convergence","Interference","Power demand","Downlink","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","cellular radio","computational complexity","Long Term Evolution","mathematical programming","power control","quantisation (signal)","radio spectrum management","resource allocation","telecommunication power management","telecommunication scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete power control","multicell networks energy efficiency","distributed resource allocation","wireless cellular networks","3GPP LTE networks","fractional discrete optimization problem","NP hard","polynomial time solution","nonlinear fractional programming","radio resource","distributed scheduling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy efficiency","discrete power control","nonlinear fractional programming","resource allocation"]},{"kwd":["Energy efficiency","discrete power control","non-linear fractional programming","resource allocation"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7349260","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2418771","startPage":"2198","endPage":"2201","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7349260/07078959.pdf","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2418771","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Scheduling and Discrete Power Control for Energy Efficiency in Multi-Cell Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 April 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Distributed Scheduling and Discrete Power Control for Energy Efficiency in Multi-Cell Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15661645","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","volume":"19","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2015","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7078959/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078959/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program"},{"fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004085","fundingName":"Ministry of Education, Science and Technology","grantNumber":"NRF-2011-0024888"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Scheduling and Discrete Power Control for Energy Efficiency in Multi-Cell Networks","sourcePdf":"lcomm-hwang-2418771-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051242S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7349260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7349260","articleId":"7078959","onlineDate":"02 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7078967,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo S.

The proposed circuit does not require very high opamp DC gain; the gain can be as low as 60 dB for 100 dB SNR data conversion.

We first focus on the solution analysis of the NEP and derive sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a Nash Equilibrium (NE). Then, we develop a general best-response-based algorithmic framework wherein the users can explicitly choose the degree of desired cooperation and signaling, converging to different types of solutions, namely: 1) a NE of the NEP when there is no cooperation among users and 2) a stationary point of the Network Utility Maximization (NUM) problem associated with the NEP, when some cooperation among the users in the form of (pricing) message passing is allowed. Finally, as a benchmark, we design a globally optimal but centralized solution method for the nonconvex NUM problem. Our experiments show that in many scenarios the sum-throughput at the NE of the NEP is very close to the global optimum of the NUM problem, which validates our noncooperative and distributed approach. When the gap of the NE from the global optimality is non negligible (e.g., in the presence of \u201chigh\u201d coupling among users), exploiting cooperation among the users in the form of pricing enhances the system performance.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2015.2412116","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/90/7452693/07078972.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7452693","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2015.2412116","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","startPage":"1153","endPage":"1166","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"To Transmit or Not to Transmit?

The data set recorded for this purpose is presented along with the performance metrics that are used to evaluate the algorithms and statistical significance tests to compare the submitted methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acoustic Scene Classification: Classifying environments from the sounds they produce","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2014.2326181","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/79/7078981/07078982.pdf","startPage":"16","endPage":"34","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2014.2326181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078981","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7078982","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7078982/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 April 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","displayDocTitle":"Acoustic Scene Classification: Classifying environments from the sounds they produce","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7078982/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15035478","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acoustic Scene Classification: Classifying environments from the sounds they produce","sourcePdf":"32msp03-barchiesi-2326181-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112386S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"7078981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"178","xplore-issue":"7078981","articleId":"7078982","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7078985,"authors":[{"name":"Yoav Shechtman","affiliation":["Technion Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Haifa, IL"],"bio":{"p":["Yoav Shechtman (yoavsh@stanford.edu) received his B.

Since then, PF has become very popular because of its ability to process observations represented by nonlinear state-space models where the noises of the model can be non-Gaussian. This methodology has been adopted in various fields, including finance, geophysical systems, wireless communications, control, navigation and tracking, and robotics. The popularity of PF has also spurred the publication of several review articles. In this article, the state of the art of resampling methods was reviewed. The methods were classified and their properties were compared in the framework of the proposed classifications. The emphasis in the article was on the classification and qualitative descriptions of the algorithms. The intention was to provide guidelines to practitioners and researchers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079001/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 April 2015","volume":"32","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"15035477","publicationDate":"May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7079001/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2015","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Resampling Methods for Particle Filtering: Classification, implementation, and strategies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resampling Methods for Particle Filtering: Classification, implementation, and strategies","sourcePdf":"32msp03-li-2330626-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104992S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"7078981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"273","xplore-issue":"7078981","articleId":"7079001","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7079025,"authors":[{"name":"Shuibing He","affiliation":["School of Computer, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China","Department of Computer Science, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Shuibing","lastName":"He","id":"37538338500"},{"name":"Yan Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085521155"},{"name":"Xian-He Sun","affiliation":["School of Computer, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Xian-He","lastName":"Sun","id":"37276409100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6750-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7079025","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":65},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7079025","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Layout","Throughput","Performance evaluation","Benchmark testing","Media","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["disc drives","file servers","flash memories","hard discs","input-output programs","parallel processing","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PSA data layout scheme","performance and space-aware data layout scheme","hybrid parallel file systems","hybrid PFS","SSD-based file servers","SServer","HDD-based file servers","HServer","adaptive varied-size file stripes","heterogeneous file servers","OrangeFS parallel file system","HPC domain","superior I/O throughput"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Parallel I/O System; Parallel File system; Data Layout; Solid State Drive"]}],"abstract":"The underlying storage of hybrid parallel file systems (PFS) is composed of both SSD-based file servers (SServer) and HDD-based file servers (HServer). Unlike a traditional HServer, an SServer consistently provides improved storage performance but lacks storage space. However, most current data layout schemes do not consider the differences in performance and space between heterogeneous servers, and may significantly degrade the performance of the hybrid PFSs. In this paper, we propose PSA, a novel data layout scheme, which maximizes the hybrid PFSs performance by applying adaptive varied-size file stripes. PSA dispatches data on heterogeneous file servers not only based on storage performance but also storage space. We have implemented PSA within OrangeFS, a popular parallel file system in the HPC domain. Our extensive experiments using a representative benchmark show that PSA provides superior I/O throughput than the default and performance-aware file data layout schemes.","doi":"10.1109/DISCS.2014.10","publicationTitle":"2014 International Workshop on Data Intensive Scalable Computing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Workshop on Data Intensive Scalable Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7078524/7079015/07079025.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"48","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DISCS.2014.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7079015","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PSA: A Performance and Space-Aware Data Layout Scheme for Hybrid Parallel File Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079025/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-16 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"PSA: A Performance and Space-Aware Data Layout Scheme for Hybrid Parallel File Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"15037247","htmlLink":"/document/7079025/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","conferenceDate":"16-16 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PSA: A Performance and Space-Aware Data Layout Scheme for Hybrid Parallel File Systems","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"6750a041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053168S","chronDate":"16-16 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7078524","isNumber":"7079015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7078524","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7079015","articleId":"7079025","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7079057,"authors":[{"name":"Priyanka Kushwah","affiliation":["ITM Gwalior, M.P., India"],"firstName":"Priyanka","lastName":"Kushwah","id":"37085517440"},{"name":"Nikhil Saxena","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE, ITM, Gwalior, M.P., India"],"firstName":"Nikhil","lastName":"Saxena","id":"37085337940"},{"name":"Shyam Akashe","affiliation":["Dept.of ECE, ITM University, Gwalior, M.P., India"],"firstName":"Shyam","lastName":"Akashe","id":"38234922000"},{"name":"Saurabh","affiliation":["DRDO Institute of Technology Management, Mussoorie, Uttarakhand, IN"],"lastName":"Saurabh"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8488-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8487-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-0659"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-0632"}],"articleNumber":"7079057","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":410},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Transistors","Switching circuits","Leakage currents","Noise measurement","Capacitors","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","DRAM chips","leakage currents","logic design","sleep"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM logic compatible 3T cell","on chip data","program memory","transistor-capacitor cell structure","memory array","word line","bit line","sleep transistor technique","semantic design","voltage source","slew rate","read access time","leakage current","noise measurement","cadence virtuoso simulating tool","voltage 0.7 V to 1.3 V","size 45 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DRAM","Leakage current","Leakage power","Slew Rate","Noise measurement","Settling time"]}],"abstract":"In this paper the analysis of DRAM logic compatible 3T cell has been shown. Due to its high density and low cost of memory, it is universally used by the advanced processor for on chip data and program memory. DRAM has transistor-capacitor cell structure, where capacitor is charged to produce 1 or 0. Memory array, which is arranged in row and column, is word line and bit line respectively. Here I have proposed sleep transistor technique at 3T dram with semantic design, for improvement of leakage and also calculated stability by calculating noise, slew rate and settling time. This circuit proposed two voltage source are connected to bit line and bit line bar respectively. Switching of main transistor is performed by word line, which is at low for write operation and high for read operation. The simulation result shows that when a wide range of operating voltage is taken, which is from 0.7 to 1.3v then it is observed that low voltage operation is suitable for low slew rate or low read access time and the leakage current reduced as increase in the range of operating voltage. At 0.7v the leakage current is 595.4\u00d710-12 amp, slew rate is 6.96\u00d7103 dB, noise measurement is 5.995\u00d710-14, settling time is 46.63\u00d710-9.

Static conditions include static and uniform background, identical poses, similar illumination, neutral frontal face. Non static conditions include position, partial occlusion orientation, varying lightening conditions and facial hair which make recognition process a complex problem. All these factors influence face recognition process. The main stages for face recognition include face detection, feature representation and classifications. Researchers have described distinct approaches for face recognition.

Due to the scaling, size of the chip decreases and number of transistor in system on chip (SOC) increases and this phenomenon also apply on memories that are used in SOC. Generally the number of transistors used in chip to store data is more as compared to the number of transistors used for other function. So in future the need of low power memories is increasing and to design low power memories leakage power is attentive parameter to design low power devices because it plays a major role in increasing the total power consumption of the devices. In this paper, 7T simple SRAM and technique based 7T SRAM has been designed and parameters like total power and leakage power has been calculated. SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) is a type of memory that provide a link with CPU and designing of SRAM is very critical because it takes large part of power and area therefore to achieve low power SRAM we have designed Memristor based SRAM. Memristor is a forth missing non-linear resistor which acts as memory and it improves the power and speed. It is invented in 1971 by L. O. Chua and in this paper MTCMOS (Multi Threshold CMOS) technique is used, recently it is very famous in academia and industry. It is a power reducing technique that helps in reducing leakage power in the SRAM by turning of the inactive circuit domains. Designing and calculation of parameters of simple SRAM, Memristor based SRAM and MTCMOS based Memristor SRAM has been done with cadence virtuoso tool and that was done at 45 nm technology with the operating voltage of 0.7 volt.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7079031","publicationTitle":"2015 Fifth International Conference on Advanced Computing & Communication Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Fifth International Conference on Advanced Computing & Communication Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel7/7078816/7079031/07079083.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ACCT.2015.58","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCT.2015.58","startPage":"222","endPage":"226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Power Memristor Based 7T SRAM Using MTCMOS Technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Feb. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079083/","displayDocTitle":"Low Power Memristor Based 7T SRAM Using MTCMOS Technique","htmlLink":"/document/7079083/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-22 Feb. 2015","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15037388","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Power Memristor Based 7T SRAM Using MTCMOS Technique","confLoc":"Haryana, India","sourcePdf":"8488a222.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076131S","chronDate":"21-22 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7078816","isNumber":"7079031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7078816","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7079031","articleId":"7079083","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7079087,"authors":[{"name":"Bhavin Shah","affiliation":["L.

This KDD CUP 1999 data set was generated by domain expert at MIT Lincon lab. To reduced number of features of this KDD CUP data set, various feature reduction techniques has been already used. These techniques reduce features from 41 into range of 10 to 22. Usage of such reduced dataset in machine learning algorithm leads to lower complexity, less processing time and high accuracy. Out of the various feature reduction technique available, one of them is Information Gain (IG) which has been already applied for the random forests classifier by Tesfahun et al. Tesfahun's approach reduces time and complexity of model and improves the detection rate for the minority classes in a considerable amount. This work investigates the effectiveness and the feasibility of Tesfahun et al.'s feature reduction technique on Back Propagation Neural Network classifier. We had performed various experiments on KDD CUP 1999 dataset and recorded Accuracy, Precision, Recall and Fscore values. In this work, we had done Basic, N-Fold Validation and Testing comparisons on reduced dataset with full feature dataset. Basic comparison clearly shows that the reduced dataset outer performs on size, time and complexity parameters. Experiments of N-Fold validation show that classifier that uses reduced dataset, have better generalization capacity. During the testing comparison, we found both the datasets are equally compatible. All the three comparisons clearly show that reduced dataset is better or is equally compatible, and does not have any drawback as compared to full dataset. Our experiments shows that usage of such reduced dataset in BPNN can lead to better model in terms of dataset size, complexity, processing time and generalization ability.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Fifth International Conference on Advanced Computing & Communication Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel7/7078816/7079031/07079087.pdf","startPage":"247","endPage":"251","publicationTitle":"2015 Fifth International Conference on Advanced Computing & Communication Technologies","doi":"10.1109/ACCT.2015.131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCT.2015.131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7079031","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7079087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing Features of KDD CUP 1999 Dataset for Anomaly Detection Using Back Propagation Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Accuracy","Training","Power capacitors","Complexity theory","Feature extraction","Intrusion detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","data handling","generalisation (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["KDD CUP 1999 dataset","anomaly detection","back propagation neural network classifier","computer network","KDD CUP 1999 data set","domain expert","MIT Lincon lab","feature reduction techniques","reduced dataset","machine learning algorithm","information gain","IG","Fscore values","n-fold validation","generalization capacity","BPNN","dataset size","complexity","generalization ability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Intrusion Detection System","Feature Reduction","Back Propagation Neural Network","N Fold Validation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079087/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Feb. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Reducing Features of KDD CUP 1999 Dataset for Anomaly Detection Using Back Propagation Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7079087/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"15037298","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","conferenceDate":"21-22 Feb. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing Features of KDD CUP 1999 Dataset for Anomaly Detection Using Back Propagation Neural Network","confLoc":"Haryana, India","sourcePdf":"8488a247.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110031S","chronDate":"21-22 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7078816","isNumber":"7079031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7078816","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7079031","articleId":"7079087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7079089,"authors":[{"name":"Joshika Sharma","affiliation":["ITM Gwalior, M.P, India"],"firstName":"Joshika","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37085592442"},{"name":"Saurabh Khandelwal","affiliation":["DRDO Institute of Technology Management, Mussoorie, Uttarakhand, IN"],"firstName":"Saurabh","lastName":"Khandelwal","id":"37061304200"},{"name":"Shyam Akashe","affiliation":["ITM Gwalior, M.P, India"],"firstName":"Shyam","lastName":"Akashe","id":"38234922000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8488-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8487-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-0659"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-0632"}],"articleNumber":"7079089","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":452},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7079089","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["SRAM cells","Logic gates","Leakage currents","Computer architecture","Delays","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microprocessor chips","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high performance SRAM cell","transmission gate","static random access memory","microprocessor","nanometers","leakage parameters","delay","TG8Twrite operation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SRAM","TG8T","leakage current","leakage power","Delay"]}],"abstract":"Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) plays a most substantial role in the microprocessor world, but as the technology is scaling down in nanometers, leakage parameters and delay are the most common problems for SRAM cell which is basically designed for very low power application. Transmission gate is used to further reduced leakage current penetrating in the 8T SRAM cell. Comparative analysis is performed by using transmission gate. This paper represents a method for design a variability aware SRAM cell. The proposed architecture of the TG8T SRAM cell is analogous to the standard 6T SRAM cell, the only exception is that they possess full transmission gates which replace an access pass transistor. The paper studies the different parameters of TG8Twrite operation at 0.7 V like leakage current is 229.2fA, leakage power is 297.4nW, delay is 20.92ns and SNR is 4.77dB.

It plays a vital role in management task of SDN controller for controlling the traffic. Anomaly detection considered as one of the important issues while monitoring the traffic. More efficiently we detect the anomalies, easier it will be for us, to manage the traffic. However we have to consider the workload, response time and overhead on network while applying the network monitoring policies, so that our network perform with similar efficiency. To reduce the overhead, it is required to perform analysis on certain portion of traffic instead of analyzing each and every packet in the network. This paper presents an adaptive mechanism for dynamically updating the policies for aggregation of flow entries and anomaly detection, so that monitoring overhead can be reduced and anomalies can be detected with greater accuracy. In previous work, rules for expansion and contraction of aggregation policies according to adaptive behavior are defined. This paper represents a work towards reducing the complexity of dynamic algorithm for updating policies of flow counting rules for anomaly detection.","doi":"10.1109/ACCT.2015.98","publicationTitle":"2015 Fifth International Conference on Advanced Computing & Communication Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Fifth International Conference on Advanced Computing & Communication Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel7/7078816/7079031/07079109.pdf","startPage":"367","endPage":"370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCT.2015.98","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7079031","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting Anomalies Efficiently in SDN Using Adaptive Mechanism","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7079109","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Feb. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079109/","displayDocTitle":"Detecting Anomalies Efficiently in SDN Using Adaptive Mechanism","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"15037379","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7079109/","conferenceDate":"21-22 Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting Anomalies Efficiently in SDN Using Adaptive Mechanism","confLoc":"Haryana, India","sourcePdf":"8488a367.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050711S","chronDate":"21-22 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7078816","isNumber":"7079031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7078816","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7079031","articleId":"7079109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7079112,"authors":[{"name":"Lavish Kansal","affiliation":["Department of Electronics &Communication Engineering, Lovely Professional University, Jalandhar, India"],"firstName":"Lavish","lastName":"Kansal","id":"37085579919"},{"name":"Vishal Sharma","affiliation":["Department of Electronics &Communication Engineering, SBSSTC, Kapurthala, Punjab, India"],"firstName":"Vishal","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37061321700"},{"name":"Jagjit Singh","affiliation":["Department of Electronics &Communication Engineering, SBSSTC, Kapurthala, Punjab, India"],"firstName":"Jagjit","lastName":"Singh","id":"37085580418"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8488-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8487-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-0659"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-0632"}],"articleNumber":"7079112","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Encoding","Rayleigh channels","Modulation","Forward error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BCH codes","channel coding","data communication","error statistics","forward error correction","OFDM modulation","phase shift keying","radiocommunication","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elevated data rate transmission","fading immunity","bandwidth efficient capability","error free transmission","FEC incorporated OFDM-MPSK wireless communication system","Rayleigh fading channel encoding technique","BER assessment","BCH codes","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","forward error correcting codes","Bose-Chadhuri-Hocquenghem encoder"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","CC","BCH","RS","M-PSK"]}],"abstract":"Due to elevated data rate transmission, fading immunity and bandwidth efficient capability, OFDM comes out as a key technology in contemporary wireless communication systems.

Some giant companies are offering the cloud services now. Migrating data to the cloud remains a tempting trend from a financial perspective but there are several other aspects that must be taken into account before it is decided to do so. One of the most important aspects is security. Cloud computing security refers to a broad set of policies, technologies, and controls deployed to protect data, applications, and the associated infrastructure of cloud computing.

Data security for RFID technology is now a mandatory condition to be provided by the manufacturer for better customer support and services. In this paper, we have proposed a security scheme which introduces a trusted Key management system. In this system, not a single key but several keys will be maintained, controlled and provided by the Key distribution server system (KDSS). It will be extremely useful for military persons in remote places where it is useful to identify specific item or guide to right route. Data will be encrypted using different programmable cellular automata (PCA) rules which is also provided with the key by the server.

The channel capacity of such systems does not merely depend on the number of degrees of freedom (DoF) it can support, but also on their gains, represented by the singular values of the channel matrix. A radio frequency based orbital angular momentum (OAM) communication system can be modeled as a MIMO multiplexing system. In the ideal case, message signals transmitted on the same frequency using multiple OAM modes can be separated by using a circular array of receive antennas. In this paper, we characterize circular arrays using three parameters: angular spacing between consecutive antennas, angular span of the elements within the array and the standard deviation of the angular spacing. We show that, the effective degrees of freedom in RF based OAM communication systems depend on the characteristics of the circular array used to receive the transmitted OAM signals.","doi":"10.1109/ACCT.2015.52","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCT.2015.52","startPage":"608","endPage":"613","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Fifth International Conference on Advanced Computing & Communication Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel7/7078816/7079031/07079154.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 Fifth International Conference on Advanced Computing & Communication Technologies","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7079031","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Degrees of Freedom in Wireless Line-of-Sight OAM Multiplexing Systems Using a Circular Array of Receiving Antennas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Feb. 2015","displayDocTitle":"The Degrees of Freedom in Wireless Line-of-Sight OAM Multiplexing Systems Using a Circular Array of Receiving Antennas","conferenceDate":"21-22 Feb. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7079154/","accessionNumber":"15037387","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079154/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Degrees of Freedom in Wireless Line-of-Sight OAM Multiplexing Systems Using a Circular Array of Receiving Antennas","confLoc":"Haryana, India","sourcePdf":"8488a608.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073929S","chronDate":"21-22 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7078816","isNumber":"7079031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7078816","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7079031","articleId":"7079154","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7079155,"authors":[{"name":"Kwasi A.

QLTS has better performance than the existing common fixed-time traffic signalization (FTS) in dealing with the ramp flow due to its flexibility in changing the traffic signal with accordance to the traffic conditions and necessity.","doi":"10.1109/AMS.2014.16","startPage":"21","endPage":"26","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 8th Asia Modelling Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel7/7078817/7079252/07079269.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 8th Asia Modelling Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AMS.2014.16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7079252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Agent-Based Traffic Flow Optimization at Multiple Signalized Intersections","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Asia"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","multi-agent systems","road traffic control","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["agent-based traffic flow optimization","multiple signalized intersections","urban traffic congestion","dynamic traffic network","traffic flow control","traffic ramp","massive traffic network problem","Q-learning actuated traffic signalization","traffic phases","QLTS","traffic signal","traffic conditions","traffic necessity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Disturbance","Multi-Agent","Q-Learning","Traffic Signalization","Traffic Flow Optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079269/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Agent-Based Traffic Flow Optimization at Multiple Signalized Intersections","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7079269/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15037443","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Agent-Based Traffic Flow Optimization at Multiple Signalized Intersections","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"6487a021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091181S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7078817","isNumber":"7079252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7078817","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7079252","articleId":"7079269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7079286,"authors":[{"name":"Abdullah Tashtoush","affiliation":["Biomedical systems, Yarmouk University, Irbid, Jordan"],"firstName":"Abdullah","lastName":"Tashtoush","id":"37085375889"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6487-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6486-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-1164"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-1172"}],"articleNumber":"7079286","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"abstract":"So far, DNA microarrays are known as a surface on which sequences from thousands of different genes are covalently attached to fixed probes.

Analysis of Enhanced Genetic Algorithm Based Network Coding in Wireless Networks","abstract":"Network coding combines several packets from different sources and broadcasts the combined packet to several destinations in single transmission time slot. Each destination is capable to extract the intended information by decoding from a common packet. In short, network coding improves the throughput for wireless and wired networks but also causes side effects such as complexity of packets management and increased delay for coding opportunity. Hence, genetic algorithm is used to optimize the resources for network coding. Genetic algorithm will search for suitable routes to the destination according to the desired throughput with a desired multicast rate. In this paper, genetic algorithm is further enhanced in searching of optimum route for a packet. The simulation results show that enhanced genetic algorithm can adapt to various situations with different topologies, providing an optimum route for a packet in the network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079302/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15037409","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7079302/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Enhanced Genetic Algorithm Based Network Coding in Wireless Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Enhanced Genetic Algorithm Based Network Coding in Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"6487a213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071052S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7078817","isNumber":"7079252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7078817","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7079252","articleId":"7079302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7079344,"authors":[{"name":"R.

While the subject of face detection and recognition has received a lot of focus, research into the features or cognitive processes that are useful for identifying gender have received relatively little attention. Researchers have attempted to extract hand crafted features like wavelet coefficients, histograms etc. on the basis of which to generate a model to classify the male and female faces. However, these models tend to compress the image into a vector and disregard the two dimensional spatial correlations between the pixels in an image. Additionally, these features have to hand crafted and may or may not be ideal for the classification at hand. Ideally, the system should be able to generate specific features from the input face image which would help in classification of male faces from female faces. In this paper and a Deep Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model is presented for gender classification. The features generated by the CNN appear to agree with known results from the cognitive science community indicating that these models may be closer to biological neuronal processes governing gender classification. The classification results are compared with different regularization techniques and other standard classifiers, and the CNN models yield higher accuracy than both svms and random forest classifiers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079349/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15037264","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7079349/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","conferenceDate":"26-27 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using Convolutional Neural Networks to Discover Cogntively Validated Features for Gender Classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Convolutional Neural Networks to Discover Cogntively Validated Features for Gender Classification","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"6751a033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102534S","chronDate":"26-27 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7078525","isNumber":"7079333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7078525","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7079333","articleId":"7079349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7079381,"authors":[{"name":"Zidong Du","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/7166378/7079381/du-2419628-small.gif","p":["Zidong Du received the bachelor\u2019s degree of engineering from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2011.

Driven by the principle of trading tolerable amounts of application accuracy in return for significant resource savings-the energy consumed, the (critical path) delay, and the (silicon) area-this approach has been limited to application-specified integrated circuits (ASICs) so far. These ASIC realizations have a narrow application scope and are often rigid in their tolerance to inaccuracy, as currently designed; the latter often determining the extent of resource savings we would achieve. In this paper, we propose to improve the application scope, error resilience and the energy savings of inexact computing by combining it with hardware neural networks. These neural networks are fast emerging as popular candidate accelerators for future heterogeneous multicore platforms and have flexible error resilience limits owing to their ability to be trained. Our results in 65-nm technology demonstrate that the proposed inexact neural network accelerator could achieve 1.78-2.67\u00d7 savings in energy consumption (with corresponding delay and area savings being 1.23 and 1.46\u00d7, respectively) when compared to the existing baseline neural network implementation, at the cost of a small accuracy loss (mean squared error increases from 0.14 to 0.20 on average).","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2015.2419628","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/7166378/07079381.pdf","startPage":"1223","endPage":"1235","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2015.2419628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7166378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leveraging the Error Resilience of Neural Networks for Designing Highly Energy Efficient Accelerators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079381/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 April 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Leveraging the Error Resilience of Neural Networks for Designing Highly Energy Efficient Accelerators","volume":"34","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15310625","htmlLink":"/document/7079381/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSF of China","grantNumber":"61100163, 61133004, 61222204, 61221062, 61303158, 61432016, 61472396, 61473275 and 60921002"},{"fundingName":"973 Program of China","grantNumber":"2015CB358800 and 2011CB302504"},{"fundingName":"Strategic Priority Research Program of the CAS","grantNumber":"XDA06010403 and XDB02040009"},{"fundingName":"International Collaboration Key Program of the CAS","grantNumber":"171111KYSB20130002"},{"fundingName":"10 000 Talent Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leveraging the Error Resilience of Neural Networks for Designing Highly Energy Efficient Accelerators","sourcePdf":"tcad-du-2419628-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079952S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"7166378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7166378","articleId":"7079381","onlineDate":"03 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7079386,"authors":[{"name":"Dae Hee Won","affiliation":["Department of Aerospace Engineering Science, University of Colorado at Boulder, Boulder, CO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/7182394/7079386/won-2415091-small.gif","p":["Dae Hee Won received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in aerospace information engineering from Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea, in 2006, 2008, and 2012, respectively.","He is currently a Research Associate with the Colorado Center for Astrodynamics Research, University of Colorado at Boulder, Boulder, CO, USA.

Given that carrier phase measurement is affected by satellite and user dynamics as well as unexpected anomalies, we propose four sequential processes to detect and identify an anomaly: 1) dynamics separation; 2) anomaly detection; 3) validation; and 4) position domain test. First, terms related to the satellite and user dynamics are estimated individually and removed from the carrier phase measurement to yield an error term, which possibly includes an anomaly and should be detected. The error term is examined with respect to a threshold level, and the measurement values are divided into anomaly candidates and normal candidates. Anomaly candidates are reexamined and validated one-by-one using a normal measurement set and the anomaly is determined. Finally, the position domain is evaluated so that position errors can be used as additional criteria for detecting the anomaly attributed to satellite deployment. The proposed algorithm is verified by simulation analyses and an experimental test. The proposed methods can be effective in detecting anomalies and increasing the reliability of precise vehicle positioning.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GNSS Carrier Phase Anomaly Detection and Validation for Precise Land Vehicle Positioning","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2015.2415091","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/7182394/07079386.pdf","startPage":"2389","endPage":"2398","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2015.2415091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7182394","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7079386","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079386/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 April 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","displayDocTitle":"GNSS Carrier Phase Anomaly Detection and Validation for Precise Land Vehicle Positioning","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7079386/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15359385","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Transportation System Innovation Program through the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs within the Korean Government"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GNSS Carrier Phase Anomaly Detection and Validation for Precise Land Vehicle Positioning","sourcePdf":"tim-lee-2415091-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108364S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"7182394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7182394","articleId":"7079386","onlineDate":"03 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7079390,"authors":[{"name":"Alice P.

The scheme requires an optimal number of samples, given by the degrees of freedom in the spectral domain, for the accurate representation of the HRTF that is band-limited in the spherical harmonic domain. The proposed scheme allows for the samples to be easily taken over the sphere due to its iso-latitude structure and non-dense sampling near the poles. In addition, the scheme can be used when samples are not taken from the south polar cap region of the sphere as the HRTF measurements are not reliable in south polar cap region due to reflections from the ground. Furthermore, the scheme has a hierarchical structure, which enables the HRTF to be analyzed at different audible frequencies using the same sampling configuration. In comparison to the proposed scheme, none of the other sampling schemes on the sphere simultaneously possess all these properties. We conduct several numerical experiments to determine the accuracy of the SHT associated with the proposed sampling scheme. We show that the SHT attains accuracy on the order of numerical precision (10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-14</sup>\n) when samples are taken over the whole sphere, both in the optimal sample placement and hierarchical configurations, and achieves an acceptable level of accuracy (10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-5</sup>\n) when samples are not taken over the south polar cap region of the sphere for the band-limits of interest.

The coplanar structure significantly simplifies the transmit-array design and eases the fabrication, in particular, at millimeter-wave frequencies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079455/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 April 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15235794","volume":"63","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7079455/","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"01 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"77-GHz Dual-Layer Transmit-Array for Automotive Radar Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"77-GHz Dual-Layer Transmit-Array for Automotive Radar Applications","sourcePdf":"tap-yeap-2419691-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117395S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7115198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"7115198","articleId":"7079455","onlineDate":"03 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7079457,"authors":[{"name":"Rengang Shi","affiliation":["College Of Science, China University of Petroleum, QingDao, China","Department of Applied Mathematics, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Rengang","lastName":"Shi","id":"37085658806"},{"name":"Haitian Yang","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Mechanics, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Haitian","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085666145"},{"name":"Liping Gao","affiliation":["Department of Computational Mathematics, China University of Petroleum(Huadong), Huangdao, Qingdao, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Liping","lastName":"Gao","id":"37711083900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"7079457","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":526},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"This letter is concerned with a new finite difference method of the 2-D Maxwell's equations in time domain by using adaptive time steps (called ATS-FDTD). First, based on the Yee's staggered points and the central difference formulas for spatial derivatives, the Maxwell's equations are reduced into a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Second, the continuous field functions of time in the system are approximated by Taylor's polynomials of high and adaptive degrees. Then, an algorithm for computing coefficients of the polynomials is proposed and, finally, the ATS-FDTD method is formed. It is shown that ATS-FDTD is second order accurate in space and any order accurate in time. By analyzing the stability domain of the system of ODEs, a criterion to select adaptively the discretizing time steps and the accuracy in time (or the degree of polynomials) is provided and the stability of ATS-FDTD is proven. Numerical experiments to compute the errors, test energy conservation, and simulate a wave propagation generated by a point source in a waveguide are carried out. Computational results confirm validity of the method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/7024204/07079457.pdf","startPage":"1706","endPage":"1709","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2015.2419625","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2015.2419625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7024204","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7079457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Time Step FDTD Method for Maxwell\u2019s Equations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Maxwell equations","Time-domain analysis","Accuracy","Stability analysis","Energy conservation","Numerical stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential equations","electromagnetic wave propagation","finite difference time-domain analysis","Maxwell equations","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wave propagation","polynomial degree","Taylor polynomials","ODE","ordinary differential equations","Yee staggered points","2D Maxwell equations","ATS-FDTD method","adaptive time step FDTD method","finite difference time domain method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alternating direction implicit finite-difference time-domain (ADI-FDTD)","convergence","energy conservation","FDTD","Maxwell\u2019s equations","stability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079457/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Time Step FDTD Method for Maxwell\u2019s Equations","volume":"14","htmlLink":"/document/7079457/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2015","accessionNumber":"15422943","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Time Step FDTD Method for Maxwell\u2019s Equations","sourcePdf":"lawp-rengang-2419625-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060254S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"7024204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7024204","articleId":"7079457","onlineDate":"03 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7079463,"authors":[{"name":"Omar Abuzaghleh","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Bridgeport, Bridgeport, CT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221039/7031990/7079463/abuza-2419612-small.gif","p":["Omar Abuzaghleh (S\u201912) received the M.S. degree in computer science from the School of Engineering, University of Bridgeport, CT, in 2007.

Statistical evidence has revealed that the majority of deaths resulting from skin cancer are as a result of melanoma. Further investigations have shown that the survival rates in patients depend on the stage of the cancer; early detection and intervention of melanoma implicate higher chances of cure. Clinical diagnosis and prognosis of melanoma are challenging, since the processes are prone to misdiagnosis and inaccuracies due to doctors' subjectivity. Malignant melanomas are asymmetrical, have irregular borders, notched edges, and color variations, so analyzing the shape, color, and texture of the skin lesion is important for the early detection and prevention of melanoma. This paper proposes the two major components of a noninvasive real-time automated skin lesion analysis system for the early detection and prevention of melanoma. The first component is a real-time alert to help users prevent skinburn caused by sunlight; a novel equation to compute the time for skin to burn is thereby introduced. The second component is an automated image analysis module, which contains image acquisition, hair detection and exclusion, lesion segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. The proposed system uses PH2 Dermoscopy image database from Pedro Hispano Hospital for the development and testing purposes. The image database contains a total of 200 dermoscopy images of lesions, including benign, atypical, and melanoma cases. The experimental results show that the proposed system is efficient, achieving classification of the benign, atypical, and melanoma images with accuracy of 96.3%, 95.7%, and 97.5%, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/JTEHM.2015.2419612","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221039/7031990/07079463.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JTEHM.2015.2419612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7031990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noninvasive Real-Time Automated Skin Lesion Analysis System for Melanoma Early Detection and Prevention","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7079463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 April 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079463/","displayDocTitle":"Noninvasive Real-Time Automated Skin Lesion Analysis System for Melanoma Early Detection and Prevention","volume":"3","publicationDate":"2015","accessionNumber":"15055993","pubMedId":"27170906","isOpenAccess":true,"externalId":"4300212","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7079463/","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Noninvasive Real-Time Automated Skin Lesion Analysis System for Melanoma Early Detection and Prevention","sourcePdf":"jtehm-faezipour-2419612-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.190216S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6221039","isNumber":"7031990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221039","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"7031990","articleId":"7079463","onlineDate":"03 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7079465,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, Australian National University, Canberra, A.C.T., Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7108080/7079465/yang-2419634_print-small.gif","p":["\nNan Yang (S'09\u2013M'11) received the B.S. degree in electronics from \nChina Agricultural University in 2005, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from the Beijing \nInstitute of Technology in 2007 and 2011, respectively.

We consider two transmission schemes: 1) an on-off transmission scheme with a constant secrecy rate for all transmission periods, and 2) an adaptive transmission scheme with a varying secrecy rate during each transmission period. For the on-off transmission scheme, an easy-to-compute expression is derived for the hybrid outage probability, which allows us to evaluate the transmission outage probability and the secrecy outage probability. For the adaptive transmission scheme where transmission outage does not occur, we derive a closed-form expression for the secrecy outage probability. Using these expressions, we determine the optimal power allocation between the information signal and the AN signal and also determine the optimal secrecy rate such that the effective secrecy throughput is maximized for both transmission schemes. We show that the maximum effective secrecy throughput requires more power to be allocated to the AN signal when the quality of the transmitter-receiver channel or the transmitter-eavesdropper channel improves. We also show that both transmission schemes achieve a higher maximum effective secrecy throughput while incurring a lower secrecy outage probability than existing schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2419634","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7108080/07079465.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2419634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7108080","startPage":"1771","endPage":"1783","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial Noise: Transmission Optimization in Multi-Input Single-Output Wiretap Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7079465","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Artificial Noise: Transmission Optimization in Multi-Input Single-Output Wiretap Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079465/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 April 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15142314","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7079465/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Australian Research Council Discovery Project","grantNumber":"DP120102607"},{"fundingName":"Australian Research Council Discovery Projects","grantNumber":"DP120102607 and DP150103905"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial Noise: Transmission Optimization in Multi-Input Single-Output Wiretap Channels","sourcePdf":"tcomm-yang-2419634-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116988S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7108080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"7108080","articleId":"7079465","onlineDate":"03 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7079468,"authors":[{"name":"Beg\u00fcl Bilgin","affiliation":["EEMCS-SCS, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands","ESAT-COSIC and iMinds, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/7124553/7079468/bilgi-2419623-small.gif","p":["Beg\u00fcl Bilgin received the master\u2019s degree in cryptography from Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, in 2010.

Threshold implementations (TIs) provide provable security against first-order power analysis attacks for hardware and software implementations. Like masking, the approach relies on secret sharing but it differs in the implementation of logic functions. While masking can fail to provide protection due to glitches in the circuit, TIs rely on few assumptions about the hardware and are fully compatible with standard design flows. We investigate two important properties of TIs in detail and point out interesting trade-offs between circuit area and randomness requirements. We propose two new TIs of AES that, starting from a common previously published implementation, illustrate possible trade-offs. We provide concrete ASIC implementation results for all three designs using the same library, and we evaluate the practical security of all three designs on the same FPGA platform. Our analysis allow us to directly compare the security provided by the different trade-offs, and to quantify the associated hardware cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079468/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 April 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7079468/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15215560","volume":"34","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Trade-Offs for Threshold Implementations Illustrated on AES","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Council of KU Leuven","grantNumber":"OT/13/071 and GOA/11/007"},{"fundingName":"FWO","grantNumber":"G.0550.12"},{"fundingName":"Hercules Foundation","grantNumber":"AKUL/11/19"},{"fundingName":"FWO Project G0B4213N"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trade-Offs for Threshold Implementations Illustrated on AES","sourcePdf":"tcad-bilgin-2419623-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095685S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"7124553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"7124553","articleId":"7079468","onlineDate":"03 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7079470,"authors":[{"name":"Gyu Sang Choi","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Yeungnam University, 280 Daehak-Ro, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk, Republic of Korea 712-749"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/7177178/7079470/choi-small.gif","p":["Gyu Sang Choi received the PhD degree in computer science and\n engineering from Pennsylvania State University.

It is two to four times denser than DRAM, orders of magnitude better than NAND Flash memory in read latency, and 10 times better than NAND Flash memory in write endurance. However, it still limits the number of write operations to at most 106 times per PCM cell. To extend its lifetime, it is necessary to evenly distribute write operations over all the memory cells. Up to now, the B\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">+</sup>\n-Tree index structure has been used to quickly locate a search key in a relational database management system (RDBMS).

Unfortunately, the practicality of mobile crowdsensing can be crippled due to the lack of incentive mechanisms that stimulate human participation. In this paper, we study incentive mechanisms for a novel Mobile Crowdsensing Scheduling (MCS) problem, where a mobile crowdsensing application owner announces a set of sensing tasks, then human users (carrying mobile devices) compete for the tasks based on their respective sensing costs and available time periods, and finally the owner schedules as well as pays the users to maximize its own sensing revenue under a certain budget.

Secure Reconfigurable Crypto IC With Countermeasures Against SPA, DPA, and EMA","abstract":"A secure reconfigurable cryptographic co-processor supporting multiple algorithms of advanced encryption standard (AES), data encryption standard (DES), rivest cipher 6, and international data encryption algorithm is proposed using its own reconfigurable feature to resist side-channel attack (SCA). It is integrated into a system-onchip and fabricated in 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS process with 1.8 V supply voltage and 100 MHz max frequency. Several kinds of specific countermeasures are proposed to hide leakage information by utilizing idle reconfigurable processing elements to do dummy operations. Its advantages lie in its little impact on area and frequency as well as high flexibility after silicon that countermeasures can also be reconfigured. Furthermore, different protections including several kinds of global countermeasures and encryption flow related countermeasures can be stacked, thus the security level can be tuned by trading for some performance or power consumption. Experimental SCA attack results show that it resists simple power analysis and differential power analysis without revealing the subkey. For correlation-based electromagnetic analysis (EMA) of DES configuration, it increases 36\u00d7 measure to disclosure when applied with partial countermeasures compared to unprotected DES. As to AES configuration with full countermeasures, it resists EMA with no sign to reveal the right subkey for up to 1.2 million electromagnetic traces.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079495/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 April 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7079495/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15215563","volume":"34","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Secure Reconfigurable Crypto IC With Countermeasures Against SPA, DPA, and EMA","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Qing Lan Project"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program)","grantNumber":"2012AA012703"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61006029"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Secure Reconfigurable Crypto IC With Countermeasures Against SPA, DPA, and EMA","sourcePdf":"tcad-shan-2419621-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036878S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"7124553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7124553","articleId":"7079495","onlineDate":"03 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7079497,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Cagatay Cirik","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Ali Cagatay","lastName":"Cirik","id":"37085390989"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"7079497","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":823},"abstract":"We consider a cellular system with a full-duplex (FD) base station (BS) serving multiple uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) users simultaneously, where all the nodes are equipped with multiple antennas.

This technique is based on a new approach, down-converted carrier co-location (DC\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n), in conjunction with a 2-D carrier co-located memory polynomial model in PA forward modeling. The concurrent dual-band DPD models for each band can then be extracted successfully according to the forward modeling results. Experimental tests have been performed for a commercial Mini Circuits amplifier and a 120-W peak power GaN base-station PA. Different signal combinations have been tested for both balanced and unbalanced output power operations in the dual bands. The results validate that the proposed method is able to achieve linearization performances comparable to those of the conventional two parallel feedback loops based technique. Even when a nonideal feedback loop with nonflat frequency responses in the two bands is used, the new method performs well when the feedback loop is calibrated in advance. This single feedback loop based concurrent dual-band DPD architecture is a strong candidate for future broadband dual-band transmitting systems.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2015.2417158","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7101309/07079498.pdf","startPage":"1556","endPage":"1568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2015.2417158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7101309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concurrent Dual-Band Digital Predistortion With a Single Feedback Loop","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7079498","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 April 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079498/","displayDocTitle":"Concurrent Dual-Band Digital Predistortion With a Single Feedback Loop","volume":"63","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15107875","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7079498/","dateOfInsertion":"04 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concurrent Dual-Band Digital Predistortion With a Single Feedback Loop","sourcePdf":"tmtt-liu-2417158-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135617S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7101309","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7101309","articleId":"7079498","onlineDate":"03 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7079499,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed A.

In a smart grid scenario, flexible devices are expected to aid the system in balancing the electric power in a technically and economically efficient way. To achieve this, the flexible devices' consumption data are theoretically recorded, elaborated, and their upcoming flexibility is bid to flexibility markets. However, there are many cases where explicit flexible device consumption data are absent. This paper presents a way to circumvent this problem and extract the potentially flexible load of a flexible device, namely a heat pump (HP), out of the aggregated energy consumption of a house. The main idea for accomplishing this is a comparison of the flexible consumer with electrically similar nonflexible consumers. The methodology is based on machine-learning techniques, probability theory, and statistics. After presenting this methodology, the general trend of the HP consumption is estimated and an hour-ahead forecast is conducted by employing seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average modeling. In this manner, the flexible consumption is predicted, establishing the basis for bidding flexibility in intraday markets, even in the absence of explicit device measurements.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2015.2414490","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","startPage":"1852","endPage":"1864","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2015.2414490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7128463","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/7128463/07079500.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Clustering algorithms","Estimation","Monitoring","Smart meters","Smart grids","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive moving average processes","energy consumption","heat pumps","learning (artificial intelligence)","load forecasting","power engineering computing","power markets","probability","smart power grids","statistical analysis","tendering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["residential heat pump consumption estimation","flexibility market applications","distribution grid","smart grid","electric power balancing","flexible device consumption data","aggregated energy consumption","machine learning technique","probability theory","statistics","HP consumption","hour-ahead forecast","autoregressive integrated moving average modeling","bidding flexibility","intraday market"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Estimation","flexibility","heat pump (HP)","nonintrusive load identification","prediction"]},{"kwd":["Estimation","flexibility","heat pump (HP)","nonintrusive load identification","prediction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of Residential Heat Pump Consumption for Flexibility Market Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079500/","volume":"6","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7079500/","accessionNumber":"15234599","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 April 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ForskEL Program through the TotalFlex Project"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of Residential Heat Pump Consumption for Flexibility Market Applications","sourcePdf":"tsg-kouzelis-2414490-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080835S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"7128463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7128463","articleId":"7079500","onlineDate":"03 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7079502,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Wen","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Division, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7272758/7079502/wen-small.gif","p":["Bo Wen (S'11\u2013M'15) received the B.S. degree from\n Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xian, China, in 2006, the M.S. and the Ph.D. degrees from Virginia Tech, USA, in 2011\n and 2014, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","He is currently a Research Associate in the Electrical Engineering Division, Department of Engineering, University\n of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.

Three-phase voltage-source converters (VSCs) are being installed more and more in the grid to improve efficiency or to utilize renewable energy sources. The same stability issues between VSCs are also reported and analyzed using a small-signal model of phase-locked loops (PLLs). This paper proposes a different impedance-based analysis method. The proposed method shows that synchronization instability in a VSC system is due to the negative incremental resistance behavior of grid-tied inverters' impedance when they are modeled in the d-q frame. System can be stabilized simply by changing the inverter's PLL design.

The received signals were recorded at each of eight antenna elements mounted on a van at locations outside and inside the flight loop. The analysis of the measurements shows that there are regions where the spatial diversity is significant, despite the sparse multipath environment, indicating spatial decorrelation at both the ground and air terminals. The variations in spatial correlation across the receiver array indicate the presence of nonplanar wavefronts produced by the signals' interaction with objects in the array near field, in particular the measurement vehicle. A similar effect is probable at the UAV, and it is expected that more significant near-field effects would arise on a more conventional air platform.

In the demand response paradigm, electric utilities provide incentives and benefits to private consumers as a compensation for their flexibility in the timing of their electricity consumption. In this paper, a dynamic energy management framework, based on highly resolved energy consumption models, is used to simulate automated residential demand response. The models estimate the residential demand using a novel bottom-up approach that quantifies consumer energy use behavior, thus providing an accurate estimation of the actual amount of controllable resources. The optimal schedule of all of the controllable appliances, including plug-in electric vehicles, is found by minimizing consumer electricity-related expenditures. Recently, time-varying electricity rate plans have been proposed by electric utilities as an incentive to their customers with the objective of re-shaping the aggregate demand. Large-scale simulations are performed to analyze and quantitatively assess the impact of demand response programs using different electricity price structures. Results show that simple time-varying electricity price structures, coupled with large-scale adoption of automated energy management systems, might create pronounced rebound peaks in the aggregate residential demand. To cope with the rebound peaks created by the synchronization of the individual residential demands, innovative electricity price structures-called Multi-TOU and Multi-CPP-are proposed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079509/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 April 2015","volume":"31","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"15786938","publicationDate":"March 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7079509/","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2016","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Residential Demand Response: Dynamic Energy Management and Time-Varying Electricity Pricing","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"","grantNumber":"1029337"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Residential Demand Response: Dynamic Energy Management and Time-Varying Electricity Pricing","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-muratori-2414880-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100691S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"7410135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"196","xplore-issue":"7410135","articleId":"7079509","onlineDate":"03 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7079511,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng-Yao Wang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/7355259/7079511/wang-2416127-small.gif","p":["Sheng-Yao Wang received the B.Sc. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2010, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include manufacturing scheduling and intelligent optimization methods."]},"firstName":"Sheng-Yao","lastName":"Wang","id":"38519051100"},{"name":"Ling Wang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/7355259/7079511/lwang-2416127-small.gif","p":["Ling Wang received the B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1995 and 1999, respectively.","Since 1999, he has been with the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, where he became a Full Professor in 2008.

A novel bi-vector-based method is proposed to represent a solution for the DAPFSP. In the searching phase of the EDA-based MA (EDAMA), the EDA-based exploration and the local-search-based exploitation are incorporated within the MA framework. For the EDA-based exploration phase, a probability model is built to describe the probability distribution of superior solutions. Besides, a novel selective-enhancing sampling mechanism is proposed for generating new solutions by sampling the probability model. For the local-search-based exploitation phase, the critical path of the DAPFSP is analyzed to avoid invalid searching operators. Based on the analysis, a critical-path-based local search strategy is proposed to further improve the potential solutions obtained in the EDA-based searching phase. Moreover, the effect of parameter setting is investigated based on the Taguchi method of design-of-experiment. Suitable parameter values are suggested for instances with different scales. Finally, numerical simulations based on 1710 benchmark instances are carried out. The experimental results and comparisons with existing algorithms show the effectiveness of the EDAMA in solving the DAPFSP. In addition, the best-known solutions of 181 instances are updated by the EDAMA.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2015.2416127","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/7355259/07079511.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2015.2416127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7355259","startPage":"139","endPage":"149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Estimation of Distribution Algorithm-Based Memetic Algorithm for the Distributed Assembly Permutation Flow-Shop Scheduling Problem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7079511","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Estimation of Distribution Algorithm-Based Memetic Algorithm for the Distributed Assembly Permutation Flow-Shop Scheduling Problem","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079511/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 April 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"46","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15663106","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7079511/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329503"},{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61174189"},{"fundingName":"Doctoral Program Foundation of Institutions of Higher Education of China","grantNumber":"20130002110057"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Estimation of Distribution Algorithm-Based Memetic Algorithm for the Distributed Assembly Permutation Flow-Shop Scheduling Problem","sourcePdf":"tsmc-wang-2416127-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124572S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"7355259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"7355259","articleId":"7079511","onlineDate":"03 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7079517,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Imani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, United States"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7101309/7079517/7079517-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alireza Imani (S\u201908) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronics engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2006 and 2008, respectively, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at the University of Southern California (USC), Los Angeles, CA, USA.","His research interests include analog and RF integrated circuits, noise in nonlinear dynamical systems, and frequency control.","Mr. Imani was ranked first in the National Olympiad of Electrical Engineering in 2006."]},"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Imani","id":"37661932900"},{"name":"Hossein Hashemi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, United States"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7101309/7079517/7079517-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Hossein Hashemi (SM\u201908) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronics engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1997 and 1999, respectively, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA, in 2001 and 2003, respectively.","In 2003, he joined the Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering Electrophysics, University of Southern California (USC), Los Angeles, CA, USA, where he is currently an Associate Professor, Ming Hsieh Faculty Fellow, and Co-Director of the Ming Hsieh Institute.

This paper investigates the impact of doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) control and operation on rotor angle stability. Acontrol strategy for both the rotor-side converter (RSC) and grid-side converter (GSC) of the DFIG is proposed to mitigate DFIGs impacts on the system stability. DFIG-GSC is utilized to be controlled as static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) to provide reactive power support during grid faults. In addition, a power system stabilizer (PSS) is implemented in the reactive power control loop of DFIG-RSC. The proposed approaches are validated on a realistic Western System Coordinating Council (WSCC) power system under both small and large disturbances. The simulation results show the effectiveness and robustness of both DFIG-GSC control strategy and PSS to enhance rotor angle stability of power system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165391/7127072/07079521.pdf","startPage":"759","endPage":"766","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","doi":"10.1109/TSTE.2015.2412176","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSTE.2015.2412176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7127072","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7079521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impacts of High Penetration of DFIG Wind Turbines on Rotor Angle Stability of Power Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system stability","Rotors","Reactive power","Stability analysis","Wind farms","Wind turbines","Oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous generators","power convertors","power system stability","reactive power control","rotors","static VAr compensators","wind turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DFIG wind turbines","rotor angle stability","wind power","power system stability","doubly fed induction generator control","rotor-side converter","grid-side converter","static synchronous compensator","STATCOM","reactive power support","grid faults","reactive power control loop"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)","power system stabilizer (PSS)","rotor angle stability","STATCOM"]},{"kwd":["Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)","power system stabilizer (PSS)","rotor angle stability","STATCOM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079521/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Impacts of High Penetration of DFIG Wind Turbines on Rotor Angle Stability of Power Systems","volume":"6","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7079521/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15219251","dateOfInsertion":"17 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impacts of High Penetration of DFIG Wind Turbines on Rotor Angle Stability of Power Systems","sourcePdf":"tste-edrah-2412176-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090096S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5165391","isNumber":"7127072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"133","xplore-issue":"7127072","articleId":"7079521","onlineDate":"03 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7079525,"authors":[{"name":"Ramprabhu Sivasamy","affiliation":["Sri Sivasubramaniya Nadar College of Engineering, Chennai, India","Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Anna University, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Ramprabhu","lastName":"Sivasamy","id":"38581204700"},{"name":"Malathi Kanagasabai","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Anna University, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Malathi","lastName":"Kanagasabai","id":"38516839900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"7079525","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2038},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"abstract":"A novel angular independent dual-band FSS with closely spaced response is discussed in this letter.

The unit cell size of the proposed FSS is 0.088 \u03bb \u00d7 0.088 \u03bb where \u03bb corresponds to the wavelength of the first resonant frequency. Both the bands are closely spaced providing the frequency ratio of upper to the lower resonant frequency value of 1.39. Additionally, the proposed dual-band FSS is symmetrical in nature, thereby providing identical stop-band response for both TE and TM operation modes. It also exhibits highly stable angular stability.

power-allocation problem in a two-tier femtocell network including a macrocell and multiple femtocells. Due to shadowing and fading effects, at each cell (macrocell or femtocell), the power levels of desired signal and interference signals vary with time. Under this circumstance, one method to achieve transmission quality in the cells is to first get channel state information (CSI) of all desired links and interference links and then perform power allocation. This method has very large communication and computation overhead. In this paper, we focus on power allocation in which the transmit power levels of the users in the cells do not need to change when the wireless channels fluctuate. We formulate a power-allocation problem subject to bounded outage probability in any cell (macrocell or femtocell). The formulated problem has probabilistic constraints. It is hard to have closed-form expressions of the probabilistic constraints. To solve this, we propose novel transformations of the constraints, based on which we obtain constraints in the format of worst-case value-at-risk. Such constraints can be converted to convex constraints, and thus, the research problem is transformed to a convex problem. For the convex problem, we provide an iterative algorithm that converges quickly. We also investigate the case when the channel gain distributions are unknown. Our proposed schemes have the merits of very small communication and computation overhead and are particularly useful in fast-fading environments.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2419512","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7452700/07079526.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2419512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7452700","startPage":"2806","endPage":"2815","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Allocation Robust to Time-Varying Wireless Channels in Femtocell Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7079526","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power Allocation Robust to Time-Varying Wireless Channels in Femtocell Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079526/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 April 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"65","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15934349","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7079526/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61473247"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2012CB720000"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Allocation Robust to Time-Varying Wireless Channels in Femtocell Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-fan-2419512-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122898S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7452700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7452700","articleId":"7079526","onlineDate":"03 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":7079528,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Yang Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7154538/7079528/lin-small.gif","p":["Fei Yang Lin (S\u201914) received the B.E.

However, such optimizations are normally performed for matched topologies which are similarly sized, over constant air gaps and without significant misalignment. In a real situation where the primary and secondary pads may not be matched and may be misaligned, pad designs must take into consideration coupling factors, leakage fluxes, pad quality factors, reflected impedance, and size. This paper analyzes the effects which variations in pad sizes, topologies, and displacements in three dimensions has on these parameters. It was found that solenoid pads should not be used as a primary pad due to high leakage fluxes, low native quality factors, and the fact that they are not fully interoperable over the whole desired range of use. Bipolar pad primaries are able to couple to any secondary pad over the entire range of use required and tend to have high native quality factors. Nonpolarized pads tend to have the lowest leakage fluxes but also low coupling. Suggestions on techniques to optimize these pads have also been included.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Magnetic Pad Sizes and Topologies for Electric Vehicle Charging","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2419592","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7154538/07079528.pdf","startPage":"6391","endPage":"6407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2419592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7154538","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7079528","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079528/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 April 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Magnetic Pad Sizes and Topologies for Electric Vehicle Charging","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7079528/","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15289507","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Magnetic Pad Sizes and Topologies for Electric Vehicle Charging","sourcePdf":"tpel-lin-2419592-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132276S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7154538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"7154538","articleId":"7079528","onlineDate":"03 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7079531,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Maria Zanchettin","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8856/7447676/7079531/7079531-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andrea Maria Zanchettin was born in Cremona, Italy, in 1983.

Moreover, in order to optimize production, humans and robots are expected to collaborate to some extent. In this scenario, involving a shared environment between humans and robots, common motion generation algorithms might turn out to be inadequate for this purpose. This paper proposes a kinematic control strategy which enforces safety, while maintaining the maximum level of productivity of the robot. The resulting motion of the (possibly redundant) robot is obtained as an output of an optimization-based real-time algorithm in which safety is regarded as a hard constraint to be satisfied. The methodology is experimentally validated on a dual-arm concept robot with 7-DOF per arm performing a manipulation task.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079531/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 April 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","volume":"13","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15918136","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2016","publicationDate":"April 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7079531/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Safety in human-robot collaborative manufacturing environments: Metrics and control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Safety in human-robot collaborative manufacturing environments: Metrics and control","sourcePdf":"tase-zanchettin-2412256-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076599S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"7447676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"7447676","articleId":"7079531","onlineDate":"03 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7079534,"authors":[{"name":"Cl\u00e9ment Jany","affiliation":["CEA LETI, Minatec, Grenoble, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7131594/7079534/7079534-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cl\u00e9ment Jany received the M.S. degree from the ENSEA engineering school in Cergy, France, in 2011.

It is composed of a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) whose supply is periodically switched on-and-off by the input signal, providing Periodically Repeated Oscillations Train (PROT). This multi-harmonic signal is injected into an oscillator (ILO) that locks onto the harmonic of interest, providing a continuous wave sinusoidal signal in the 60 GHz band.

A theoretical approach on the synchronization of the PROT signal generator and the ILO is proposed, based on custom approximated solutions of the Van der Pol oscillator and highlighting new synchronization phenomena. Based on this theory, this novel programmable multiplication technique requires a unique fixed low frequency reference to perform multi-channel mmW LO generation. The phase noise of the output LO signal is only limited by the input low frequency reference phase noise and the frequency ratio between the output and the input signals. Thus, a 60 GHz signal has been generated with this technique with a record phase noise of -104 dBc/Hz@1 MHz offset.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2015.2411623","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/7131594/07079534.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2015.2411623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7131594","startPage":"1669","endPage":"1679","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Programmable Frequency Multiplier-by-29 Architecture for Millimeter Wave Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7079534","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Programmable Frequency Multiplier-by-29 Architecture for Millimeter Wave Applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079534/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 April 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"50","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15250583","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7079534/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Programmable Frequency Multiplier-by-29 Architecture for Millimeter Wave Applications","sourcePdf":"jssc-jany-2411623-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080525S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"7131594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7131594","articleId":"7079534","onlineDate":"03 April 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7079578,"authors":[{"name":"Jarmo Lunden","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, Aalto University, Finland"],"bio":{"p":["Jarmo Lund\u00e9n is with the Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Finland."]},"firstName":"Jarmo","lastName":"Lunden","id":"37304324400"},{"name":"Visa Koivunen","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, Aalto University, Finland"],"bio":{"p":["Visa Koivunen is with the Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Finland."]},"firstName":"Visa","lastName":"Koivunen","id":"37269798700"},{"name":"H.

The scarcity of useful radio spectrum is mainly due to the static allocation and rigid regulation of the spectrum use rather than the spectrum being actually fully in use. Flexible spectrum use and cognitive radio technologies provide an approach to alleviating this problem by allowing for secondary spectrum use while the spectrum is underutilized by its primary licensed users. Idle spectrum is a time-frequency-location varying resource. It is a resource that also depends on the relative locations of the primary and secondary receivers and transmitters as well as the instantaneous propagation conditions. By acquiring awareness about the current radio environment and the other spectrum users, cognitive radios can more efficiently exploit idle spectrum and manage interference. Doing so requires a means to explore the spectrum to identify high-quality and persistent local spectral resources and access and share them among a number of users while strictly controlling the interference caused to others, in particular, licensed primary users (PUs). Situational awareness about the state of the spectrum allows for optimal exploitation of underutilized spectrum. For example, idle subbands may be allocated, and waveform parameters may be chosen to maximize the sum-rate for the cognitive users while making sure no harmful interference is caused to the other users of the spectrum.","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2014.2338894","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/79/7078981/07079578.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2014.2338894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078981","startPage":"123","endPage":"140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum Exploration and Exploitation for Cognitive Radio: Recent Advances","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7079578","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Exploration and Exploitation for Cognitive Radio: Recent Advances","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079578/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 April 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"32","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15035480","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7079578/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Exploration and Exploitation for Cognitive Radio: Recent Advances","sourcePdf":"32msp03-lunden-2338894-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153981S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"7078981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"7078981","articleId":"7079578","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7079593,"authors":[{"name":"Fredrik Rusek","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Sweden"],"bio":{"p":["Fredrik Rusek is an associate professor in the Department of Electrical and Information Technology at Lund University, Sweden."]},"firstName":"Fredrik","lastName":"Rusek","id":"37283101000"},{"name":"Giulio Colavolpe","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell'Informazione, University of Parma, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Giulio Colavolpe is an associate professor in the Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell'Informazione at the University of Parma, Italy."]},"firstName":"Giulio","lastName":"Colavolpe","id":"37269690300"},{"name":"Carl Erik W.

Least squares estimation of the complex amplitudes of sinusoids with known frequencies followed by extrapolation to the desired prediction range, is here interpreted as a linear FIR predictor using a sinusoidal filter. This interpretation enables an analysis of the properties of the predictor. An improved method utilizing a Wiener predictor, designed under the assumption that all the complex sinusoids have equal magnitudes, is proposed. The performance of the different prediction methods are evaluated in simulations and the proposed predictor is seen to have a performance close to the optimal Wiener predictor.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079790/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Sept. 2004","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 Sept. 2004","htmlLink":"/document/7079790/","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2004","accessionNumber":"15037581","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An fir predictor interpretation of LS estimation of sinusoidal amplitudes followed by extrapolation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An fir predictor interpretation of LS estimation of sinusoidal amplitudes followed by extrapolation","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"cr1273.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040628S","chronDate":"6-10 Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"7079653","isNumber":"7079654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7079653","xplore-issue":"7079654","articleId":"7079790","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7079792,"authors":[{"name":"Guichang Zhong","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Guichang Zhong","id":"37271413300"},{"name":"Fan Xu","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Xu","id":"37275296700"},{"name":"Alan N.

By first observing high correlation between ICIs of adjacent subcarriers, we then devise an inter-carrier cancellation scheme. From the ICI-reduced signal, we are able to achieve good channel estimation and equalization accuracy. Simulations show that the new method can effectively combat fast-fading channel conditions.

Iterative decoding of serially coded CPM yields high performances when reasonable interleaver sizes (less than 1024) are considered. Performances of some binary and quaternary coded CPM schemes are assessed, then the effect of the modulation index on waveform performance is emphasized. Simulation results will represent a guideline to select the best fitted CPM for future satellite communications systems in Ka band. The choice takes into account power and spectral performances, complexity as well as adaptive aspects. The latter criterion is justified by the significant channel fluctuations in Ka band. In such circumstances, non adaptive waveform leads automatically either to a non efficient channel exploitation or weak system availability.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTTA.2004.1307730","doi":"10.1109/ICTTA.2004.1307730","displayPublicationTitle":"2004 12th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7079653/7079654/07079869.pdf","startPage":"1083","endPage":"1086","publicationTitle":"2004 12th European Signal Processing Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7079654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous Phase Modulations for future satellite communication systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Continuous Phase Modulations for future satellite communication systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079869/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Sept. 2004","conferenceDate":"6-10 Sept. 2004","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2004","accessionNumber":"15037699","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7079869/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous Phase Modulations for future satellite communication systems","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"cr1402.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030135S","chronDate":"6-10 Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"7079653","isNumber":"7079654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7079653","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7079654","articleId":"7079869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":7079930,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander A.

The performance of the proposed equalizer is better compared to the performance of a CMA-based blind equalizer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079964/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Sept. 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","accessionNumber":"15037505","htmlLink":"/document/7079964/","conferenceDate":"6-10 Sept. 2004","displayDocTitle":"A symbol by symbol clustering based blind equalizer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A symbol by symbol clustering based blind equalizer","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"cr1553.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046221S","chronDate":"6-10 Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"7079653","isNumber":"7079654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7079653","xplore-issue":"7079654","articleId":"7079964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7079978,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Now, the time has come to demonstrate this progress in terms of applications, where the intermediate step towards a customized product consists in more or less rapid \u201cprototyping\u201d. Due to the multitude of different algorithmic approaches, i.e. beamforming, space-time coding, spatial multiplexing, and of different standards, i.e. UMTS, WLAN's, an ideal prototyping platform requires a high degree of flexibility and modularity in order to be qualified for a wide range of potential applications. The aim of this contribution is to give an overview about the challenges, the rich variety and the usefulness of such MIMO hardware platforms.","publicationTitle":"2004 12th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2004 12th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7079653/7079654/07079978.pdf","startPage":"681","endPage":"688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7079654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prototyping for MIMO systems - an overview","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7079978","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Sept. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079978/","displayDocTitle":"Prototyping for MIMO systems - an overview","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2004","accessionNumber":"15037648","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7079978/","conferenceDate":"6-10 Sept. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prototyping for MIMO systems - an overview","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"cr1577.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.294578S","chronDate":"6-10 Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"7079653","isNumber":"7079654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7079653","xplore-issue":"7079654","articleId":"7079978","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7079980,"authors":[{"name":"Renato Cavalcante","affiliation":["Dept. of Communications and Integrated Systems, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Renato","lastName":"Cavalcante","id":"37426062200"},{"name":"Isao Yamada","affiliation":["Dept. of Communications and Integrated Systems, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Isao","lastName":"Yamada","id":"37282458700"},{"name":"Kohichi Sakaniwa","affiliation":["Dept. of Communications and Integrated Systems, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Kohichi","lastName":"Sakaniwa","id":"37283009600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-320-0001-65-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7079980","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":20},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Multiaccess communication","Abstracts","Noise","Adaptive algorithms","Adaptive filters","Filtering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude estimation","code division multiple access","expectation-maximisation algorithm","filtering theory","gradient methods","interference suppression","radiofrequency interference","set theory","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast blind multiple access interference reduction","DS-CDMA systems","adaptive projected subgradient method","blind multiple access interference suppression filter","blind MAl suppression filter","convex sets","desired signal amplitude estimation","stochastic approximation","EM type algorithm"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel blind multiple access interference (MAI) suppression filter in DS/CDMA systems. The filter is adaptively updated by parallelly projecting them onto a series of convex sets. These sets are defined based on the received signal as well as a priori knowledge about the desired user's signature. In order to achieve fast convergence and good performance at steady state, the adaptive projected subgradient method (Yamada et al., 2003) is applied. The proposed scheme also jointly estimates the desired signal amplitude and the filter coefficients based on a stochastic approximation of an EM type algorithm, following the original idea proposed by Park and Doherty, 1997. Simulation results highlight the fast convergence behavior and good performance at steady state of the proposed scheme.","publicationTitle":"2004 12th European Signal Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2004 12th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7079653/7079654/07079980.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7079654","startPage":"161","endPage":"164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast blind multiple access interference reduction in DS/CDMA systems by adaptive projected subgradient method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7079980","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A fast blind multiple access interference reduction in DS/CDMA systems by adaptive projected subgradient method","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Sept. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079980/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 Sept. 2004","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2004","accessionNumber":"15037490","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7079980/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast blind multiple access interference reduction in DS/CDMA systems by adaptive projected subgradient method","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"cr1582.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057167S","chronDate":"6-10 Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"7079653","isNumber":"7079654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7079653","xplore-issue":"7079654","articleId":"7079980","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7079996,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, N.

Unlike the conventional approach where isolated pilot tones are used, in this paper every two pilot tones are clustered as a group and these groups are equally spaced. The pilot sequence is carefully designed, of which the left hand sided pilot symbol in each cluster is antipodal with the right hand sided one. The performance in terms of the pilot channel interference ratio (CIR) can be significantly improved by the proposed pilot scheme. Theoretical analysis shows that the clustered pilot tones can give a substantially lower CFO variance than that of the isolated pilot tones. Simulation results are presented to verify our newly proposed theory.","displayPublicationTitle":"2004 12th European Signal Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7079653/7079654/07079996.pdf","startPage":"901","endPage":"904","publicationTitle":"2004 12th European Signal Processing Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7079654","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7079996","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clustered pilot tones for carrier frequency offset compensation in OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Abstracts","OFDM","Bandwidth","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency estimation","intercarrier interference","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot tone placing","pilot sequence design","OFDM systems","isolated pilot tones","pilot channel interference ratio","CIR","clustered pilot tones","CFO variance","carrier frequency offset compensation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7079996/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Sept. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Clustered pilot tones for carrier frequency offset compensation in OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7079996/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2004","accessionNumber":"15037716","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2015","conferenceDate":"6-10 Sept. 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clustered pilot tones for carrier frequency offset compensation in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"cr1610.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063724S","chronDate":"6-10 Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"7079653","isNumber":"7079654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7079653","xplore-issue":"7079654","articleId":"7079996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUSIPCO","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"}]
