We also present a system, H-SWEB, implementing our techniques and showing experimental improvements of over 250%, which have been achieved through utilizing a global approach to scheduling requests. This is the first system to provide a hierarchical scheduling mechanism for distributed HTTP server clusters incorporating dynamic client-server task distribution and distributed data access. H-SWEB uses sophisticated scheduling techniques in monitoring and adapting to workload variation at the client and server clusters for supporting typical digital library tasks, such as fast WWW image browsing. We provide a discussion of our system architecture and implementation, and briefly summarize the experimental results that have been achieved.","doi":"10.1109/HPDC.1998.710016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15339","startPage":"301","endPage":"308","pdfPath":"/iel4/5737/15339/00710016.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Our first algorithm develops a schedule by computing a series of matchings in a bipartite graph. We also present a O(P/sup 3/) heuristic algorithm, whose completion time is within twice the optimal.

Variable structure control (VSC) of the average DC bus capacitor of the AF is employed. A hysteresis rule based carrierless pulse width modulation (PWM) current control scheme is employed to generate the gating signals to the switching devices of the active filter. A set of three single-phase diode bridge rectifiers feeding a resistive-capacitive load is used for nonlinear loads on three-phase four-wire power systems. The merits of the proposed method of control are: (1) less complex and reliable active filter configuration; (2) fast controller action; (3) negligible transients in the DC bus voltage of the active filter at the time of instant load changes; (4) gradual convergence of controlled supply currents to new steady state values at the occurrence of abrupt load changes; (5) total harmonic distortion (THD) of the compensated load has been brought well below the standard harmonic specification IEEE-519 limit; (6) neutral current is reduced below 1%; and (7) simultaneous balancing of unbalanced loads. Simulated results confirm the validity of the proposed approach for three-phase (12.5 kW)/two-phase (8.3 kW)/single-phase (4.2 kW) nonlinear loads. The suggested method is expected to be widely used in future for active power filter designs produced for load compensation.","displayPublicationTitle":"Power Quality '98","pdfPath":"/iel4/5758/15381/00710360.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"94","publicationTitle":"Power Quality '98","doi":"10.1109/PQ.1998.710360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PQ.1998.710360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15381","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=710360","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable structure control of four pole voltage source inverter for active filtering of nonlinear loads in 3-phase 4-wire systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Active filters","Pulse width modulation","Pulse width modulation inverters","Load management","Power system harmonics","Power harmonic filters","Pulse power systems","Power system reliability","Power system transients"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system harmonics","power filters","active filters","harmonic distortion","power system control","control system synthesis","PWM invertors","DC-AC power convertors","variable structure systems","reactive power control","load (electric)","control system analysis","compensation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-phase four-wire power systems","voltage source inverter","VSI","active power filter","reactive power compensation","control design","load balancing","harmonic elimination","neutral current compensation","nonlinear loads","variable structure control","control simulation","gating signals","PWM current control scheme","switching devices","single-phase diode bridge rectifiers","resistive-capacitive load","total harmonic distortion","IEEE-519","12.5 kW","8.3 kW","4.2 kW"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/710360/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18 Jun 1998","displayDocTitle":"Variable structure control of four pole voltage source inverter for active filtering of nonlinear loads in 3-phase 4-wire systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"6068638","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-18 June 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable structure control of four pole voltage source inverter for active filtering of nonlinear loads in 3-phase 4-wire systems","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"00710360.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035761S","chronDate":"18 Jun 1998","isNumber":"15381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5758","citationCount":"4","articleId":"710360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":710444,"authors":[{"name":"Minghui Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Akron, Akron, OH, USA"],"lastName":"Minghui Xu","id":"37087658785"},{"name":"N.

Microcalcifications (MCs) are small crystals of calcium phosphates that form in human tissue through a number of mechanisms. The size, morphology, and distribution of MCs are important indicators in the mammographic screening for and diagnosis of various carcinomas in the breast. The authors are investigating the imaging of MCs under ultrasound in the interest of extending the utility of medical ultrasound in the breast clinic. They present an analysis of the acoustic properties of MCs modeled as elastic spheres based on the Faran model that considers the predicted complex spectra and spatial coherence of echoes from MCs. They have found the predictions of the model to be similar to ultrasound echoes from suspected MCs in vivo. They also present breast phase aberration estimates and spatial and frequency compounding results based on the echoes from these targets.","doi":"10.1109/58.710559","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","startPage":"925","endPage":"934","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.710559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15411","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/15411/00710559.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic imaging","Breast","Predictive models","Biomedical imaging","Medical diagnostic imaging","Frequency estimation","Acoustic scattering","Visualization","Crystals","Calcium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrasonic scattering","biomedical ultrasonics","physiological models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microcalcifications","elastic scatterers","medical ultrasound","US imaging","breast","morphology","size","mammographic screening","carcinomas","elastic spheres","Faran model","complex spectra","spatial coherence","phase aberration estimates","frequency compounding","spatial compounding","medical diagnostic imaging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Microcalcifications as elastic scatterers under ultrasound","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/710559/","volume":"45","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"6008509","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"18244247","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microcalcifications as elastic scatterers under ultrasound","sourcePdf":"00710559.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.19232S","chronDate":"July  1998","isNumber":"15411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"24","articleId":"710559","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":710560,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The statistical performance of the new 2-D narrowband time-domain root-MUSIC blood velocity estimator described previously is evaluated using both simulated and flow phantom wideband (50% fractional bandwidth) ultrasonic data. Comparisons are made with the standard 1-D Kasai estimator and two other wideband strategies: the time domain correlator and the wideband point maximum likelihood estimator. A special case of the root-MUSIC, the \"spatial\" Kasai, is also considered. Simulation and flow phantom results indicate that the root-MUSIC blood velocity estimator displays a superior ability to reconstruct spatial blood velocity information under a wide range of operating conditions. The root-MUSIC mode velocity estimator can be extended to effectively remove the clutter component from the sample volume data. A bimodal velocity estimator is formed by processing the signal subspace spanned by the eigenvectors corresponding to the two largest eigenvalues of the Doppler correlation matrix. To test this scheme, in vivo common carotid flow complex Doppler data was obtained from a commercially available color flow imaging system. Velocity estimates were made using a reduced form of this data corresponding to higher frame rates. The extended root-MUSIC approach was found to produce superior results when compared to both 1- and 2-D Kasai-type estimators that used initialized clutter filters. The results obtained using simulated, flow phantom, and in vivo data suggest that increased sensitivity as well as effective clutter suppression can be achieved using the root-MUSIC technique, and this may be particularly important for wideband high frame rate imaging applications.","doi":"10.1109/58.710568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15411","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.710568","endPage":"971","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/15411/00710568.pdf","startPage":"955","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new time-domain narrowband velocity estimation technique for Doppler ultrasound flow imaging.

The high frame rate necessary for real-time volumetric imaging is achieved using a sparse synthetic aperture beamforming technique utilizing only a few transmit pulses for each image. Grating lobes in the two-way radiation pattern are avoided by adjusting the transmit element spacing and the receive aperture functions to account for the missing transmit elements. The signal loss associated with fewer transmit pulses is minimized by increasing the power delivered to each transmit element and by using multiple transmit elements for each transmit pulse. By mechanically rocking the array, in a way similar to what is done with an annular array, a 3-D set of images can be collected in the time normally required for a single image.","doi":"10.1109/58.710573","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","startPage":"980","endPage":"988","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/15411/00710573.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.710573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time 3-D ultrasound imaging using sparse synthetic aperture beamforming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic imaging","Phased arrays","Array signal processing","Gratings","Apertures","Propagation losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrasonic imaging","ultrasonic arrays","array signal processing","acoustic signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse synthetic aperture beamforming","real-time three-dimensional ultrasound imaging","linear phased array","mechanical scanning","volumetric imaging","grating lobe","radiation pattern"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1998","displayDocTitle":"Real-time 3-D ultrasound imaging using sparse synthetic aperture beamforming","volume":"45","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6008514","pubMedId":"18244252","publicationDate":"July 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/710573/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time 3-D ultrasound imaging using sparse synthetic aperture beamforming","sourcePdf":"00710573.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041983S","chronDate":"July  1998","isNumber":"15411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"224","articleId":"710573","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":710587,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Huo Liu","affiliation":["Klipsch School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, USA"],"lastName":"Qing Huo Liu","id":"37277487800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-3010"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1525-8955"}],"articleNumber":"710587","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":72,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":608},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/index2.asp"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=710587","abstract":"A technique based on the combination of Fourier pseudospectral method and the perfectly matched layer (PML) is developed to simulate transient acoustic wave propagation in multidimensional, inhomogeneous, absorptive media. Instead of the finite difference approximation in the conventional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, this technique uses trigonometric functions, through an FFT (fast Fourier transform) algorithm, to represent the spatial derivatives in partial differential equations. Traditionally the Fourier pseudospectral method is used only for spatially periodic problems because the use of FFT implies periodicity. In order to overcome this limitation, the perfectly matched layer is used to attenuate the waves from other periods, thus allowing the method to be applicable to unbounded media. This new algorithm, referred to as the pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) algorithm, is developed to solve large-scale problems for acoustic waves. It has an infinite order of accuracy in the spatial derivatives, and thus requires much fewer unknowns than the conventional FDTD method. Numerical results confirms the efficacy of the PSTD method.","doi":"10.1109/58.710587","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","startPage":"1044","endPage":"1055","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/15411/00710587.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.710587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) algorithm for acoustic waves in absorptive media","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time domain analysis","Acoustic waves","Finite difference methods","Perfectly matched layers","Acoustic propagation","Multidimensional systems","Nonhomogeneous media","Fast Fourier transforms","Approximation algorithms","Partial differential equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic wave absorption","time-domain analysis","fast Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pseudospectral time-domain algorithm","perfectly matched layer","simulation","transient acoustic wave propagation","multidimensional inhomogeneous absorptive medium","trigonometric function","FFT","partial differential equation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1998","displayDocTitle":"The pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) algorithm for acoustic waves in absorptive media","volume":"45","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6008521","pubMedId":"18244259","publicationDate":"July 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/710587/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) algorithm for acoustic waves in absorptive media","sourcePdf":"00710587.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049047S","chronDate":"July  1998","isNumber":"15411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"72","articleId":"710587","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":710591,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We explore correlation processing using fully common spatial frequencies of overlapping subapertures to adapt beamforming for motion and phase aberrations. Signals derived from the subset of elements representing common spatial frequencies exhibit significantly higher correlation coefficients than those from signals computed using the entire subaperture. In addition, the correlation coefficient decreases linearly with subaperture separation for complete subaperture signals, but remains nearly constant with subaperture separation if only common spatial frequencies are used. Adaptive multi-element synthetic aperture imaging with correlation processing using fully common spatial frequencies is tested on experimental RF data acquired from a diffuse scattering phantom using a 3.5 MHz, 128-element transducer array. The results indicate that common spatial frequencies can be used efficiently for correlation processing to correct motion and phase aberration for adaptive multi-element synthetic aperture imaging.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive multi-element synthetic aperture imaging with motion and phase aberration correction","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/58.710591","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/15411/00710591.pdf","startPage":"1077","endPage":"1087","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.710591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15411","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=710591","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/710591/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1998","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive multi-element synthetic aperture imaging with motion and phase aberration correction","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1998","accessionNumber":"6008525","pubMedId":"18244263","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive multi-element synthetic aperture imaging with motion and phase aberration correction","sourcePdf":"00710591.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03324S","chronDate":"July  1998","isNumber":"15411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"52","articleId":"710591","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":710592,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The echo shifts are due to the combination of the local temperature dependence of speed of sound and thermal expansion in the heated region. A linear relationship between these shifts and the underlying tissue temperature rise is derived from first principles and experimentally validated. The echo shifts are estimated from the correlation of successive backscattered ultrasound frames, and the axial derivative of the accumulated echo shifts is shown to be proportional to the temperature rise. Sharp lateral gradients in the temperature distribution introduce ripple on the estimates of the echo shifts due to a thermo-acoustic lens effect. This ripple can be effectively reduced by filtering the echo shifts along the axial and lateral directions upon differentiation. However, this is achieved at the expense of spatial resolution. Experimental evaluation of the accuracy (0.5/spl deg/C) and spatial resolution (2 mm) of the algorithm in tissue mimicking phantoms was conducted using a diagnostic ultrasound imaging scanner and a therapeutic ultrasound unit. The estimated temperature maps were overlaid on the gray-scale ultrasound images to illustrate the applicability of this technique for image guidance of focused ultrasound thermal therapy.","doi":"10.1109/58.710592","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/15411/00710592.pdf","startPage":"1088","endPage":"1099","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15411","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.710592","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1998","displayDocTitle":"Two-dimensional temperature estimation using diagnostic ultrasound","volume":"45","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1998","accessionNumber":"6008526","pubMedId":"18244264","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/710592/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-dimensional temperature estimation using diagnostic ultrasound","sourcePdf":"00710592.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046917S","chronDate":"July  1998","isNumber":"15411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"322","articleId":"710592","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":710597,"authors":[{"name":"B.

A direct consequence of the ill-posedness is high sensitivity errors in measurements. In addition several assumptions made to reduce computational complexity are, in fact, rough approximation. This factors contribute to a limited spatial resolution and result in low accuracy in EIT images. Accordingly to improve electrical impedance images it is necessary to evaluate collected data with a new approach. This paper presents a reconstruction algorithm based on a neural network technique which calculates conductivity changes directly from finite-element simulations of the forward problem. The advantages of this method are it's speed of image reconstruction, it's conceptual simplicity, and ease of implementation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/710597/","accessionNumber":"6154422","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"22-22 May 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A finite element method based neural network technique for image reconstruction in electrical impedance imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A finite element method based neural network technique for image reconstruction in electrical impedance imaging","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"00710597.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039739S","chronDate":"20-22 May 1998","isNumber":"15324","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5728","citationCount":"2","articleId":"710597","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":710618,"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-5060-X","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-3555"}],"articleNumber":"710618","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":24},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Signal processing","Signal Processing Society","Conferences","Libraries","Permission","IEEE services","IEEE catalog","USA Councils"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=710618","doi":"10.1109/NNSP.1998.710618","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00710618.png","startPage":"i","endPage":"ii","publicationTitle":"Neural Networks for Signal Processing VIII.

The technique requires neither specialized hardware nor large quantities of additional memory and is based on the ubiquitous idea of difference transmission, widely used in signal coding.

In this paper, an heuristic pattern correction scheme based upon an hierarchical data partitioning principle is proposed for digit word recognition. This scheme is based upon general regression neural networks (GRNNs) with initial centroid vectors obtained by graph theoretic data-pruning methods. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can perfectly correct the mis-classified patterns and hence improves the generalisation performance without affecting the old information. Moreover, it is also established that the initial setting of radial basis functions (RBFs) based upon graph theoretic data-pruning methods yields better performance than those obtained by k-means and learning vector quantisation (LVQ) methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/710665/","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Aug-2 Sep 1998","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-2 Sept. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"6040876","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An heuristic pattern correction scheme for GRNNs and its application to speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An heuristic pattern correction scheme for GRNNs and its application to speech recognition","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"00710665.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049825S","chronDate":"31 Aug-2 Sep 1998","isNumber":"15338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5736","citationCount":"10","articleId":"710665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":710669,"authors":[{"name":"C.K.I.

Within an analytical and statistical framework, dependency of neural learning on the distribution characteristic of training set vectors is established for a function approximation problem. It is shown that the BP algorithm works well for a certain type of training set vector distribution and the degree of saturation can be reduced in the hidden layer, when this behaviour is exploited. A modification to the distribution characteristic of the input vectors through pre-processing in order to exploit the behaviour of the BP algorithm towards a particular input vector distribution characteristic is proposed in estimating the parameters of an articulatory speech synthesizer. The same concept of incorporating the speech signal distribution characteristic into the process has been used in speech coding techniques such as PCM for performance improvement.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Aug-2 Sep 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/710686/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"6040892","conferenceDate":"2-2 Sept. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting the statistical characteristic of the speech signals for an improved neural learning in a MLP neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting the statistical characteristic of the speech signals for an improved neural learning in a MLP neural network","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"00710686.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044114S","chronDate":"31 Aug-2 Sep 1998","isNumber":"15338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5736","citationCount":"1","articleId":"710686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":710687,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

When used to compare distributions that have the same overall mass, the EMD is a true metric, and has easy-to-compute lower bounds.

The Bayesian mixed-state framework is described in its generality, and the example of a bouncing ball is used to demonstrate that a mixed-state model can significantly improve tracking performance in heavy clutter.

The main emphasis is on using a small number of examples. Previous work assumed that the set of examples is sufficient to span the entire space of possible objects, and that in generalizing to a new viewing conditions a sufficient number of previous examples under the new conditions will be available to the recognition system. Here we have considerably relaxed these assumptions and consequently obtained good class-based generalization from a small number of examples, even a single example view, for both viewing position and illumination changes. In addition, previous class-based approaches only focused on viewing position changes and did not deal with illumination changes. Here we used a class-based approach that can generalize for both illumination and viewing position changes. The method was applied to face and car model images.

The method exploits knowledge of the anatomy of the cortex and incorporates structural constraints into the segmentation. First, the white matter and CSF regions in the MR volume are segmented using some novel techniques of posterior anisotropic diffusion. Then, the user selects the cortical white matter component of interest, and its structure is verified by checking for cavities and handles. After this, a connected representation of the gray matter is created by a constrained growing-out from the white matter boundary. Because the connectivity is computed, the segmentation can be used as input to several methods of visualizing the spatial pattern of cortical activity within gray matter. In our case, the connected representation of gray matter is used to create a representation of the flattened cortex. Then, fMRI measurements are overlaid on the flattened representation, yielding a representation of the volumetric data within a single image.","publicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Computer Vision (IEEE Cat.

To this end, it is necessary to recover both head-pose and facial expression from the facial movement of a performer. However, both effects are coupled. This is a serious problem, which previous studies haven't fully considered. The solution to this interaction problem proposed here is to solve explicitly, at each timestep, for pose and expression variables. In principle this is a nonlinear inverse problem. However, appropriate parameterisation of pose in terms of affine transformations with parallax, and of expression in terms of key-frames, reduces the problem to a bilinear one. This can then be solved directly by Singular Value Decomposition. Thus actor-driven animation has ben implemented in real-time, at video field-rate, using two Indy desktop workstations.","pdfPath":"/iel4/5756/15374/00710738.pdf","startPage":"323","endPage":"328","publicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Computer Vision (IEEE Cat.

As the heart is beating, it is difficult for the physician to observe closely a particular point (e.g. stenosis) on the artery tree. We propose, to rigidly compensate the sequence so that the area around the point of interest appears stable. This is a difficult problem because the arteries deform in a non-rigid manner and only their 2D X-ray projection is observed. Also, the lack of features around the selected point makes the matching subject to the aperture problem. The algorithm automatically extracts a section of the artery of interest, models it as a polyline, and tracks it. The problem is formulated as an energy minimization problem which is solved using a shortest path in a graph algorithm. The motion compensated sequence can be obtained by translating every pixel so that the point of interest remains stable. We have applied this algorithm to many examples in two sets of angiography data and have obtained excellent results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal polyline tracking for artery motion compensation in coronary angiography","publicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Computer Vision (IEEE Cat.

We present sectored snakes, a formulation that demonstrably improves upon regular snakes. A traditional deformable model (\"snake\" in 2D) fails to find an object's boundary when the strongest nearby image edges are not the ones sought. But models can be trained to respond to other image features instead, by learning their probability distributions. The implementor must then decide on which of many image qualities to teach the model. To this end, we show how to evaluate the efficacy of any resulting deformable model, given a sampling of ground truth, a model of the range of shapes tried during optimization, and a measure of shape closeness. In the domain of abdominal CT images, we demonstrate such evaluation on a simple \"sectoring\" of a snake, in which intensity and perpendicular gradient are observed over equal-length segments. This specific set of qualities shows a measured improvement over an objective function that is uniform around the shape, and it follows naturally from examination of the latter's failures due to images variations around the organ boundary.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape measurement","Deformable models","Image segmentation","Abdomen","Computer science","Probability distribution","Image quality","Image sampling","Computed tomography","US Department of Defense"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","medical image processing","computerised tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deformable models","image segmentation","learned-energy segmentations","sectored snakes","image qualities","deformable model","abdominal CT images"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1998.710753","publicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Computer Vision (IEEE Cat.

The detection technique we develop is based on a wavelet representation of an object class derived from a statistical analysis of the class instances. By learning an object class in terms of a subset of an overcomplete dictionary of wavelet basis functions, we derive a compact representation of an object class which is used as an input to a support vector machine classifier. This representation overcomes both the problem of in-class variability and provides a low false detection rate in unconstrained environments. We demonstrate the capabilities of the technique in two domains whose inherent information content differs significantly. The first system is face detection and the second is the domain of people which, in contrast to faces, vary greatly in color, texture, and patterns. Unlike previous approaches, this system learns from examples and does not rely on any a priori (hand-crafted) models or motion-based segmentation. The paper also presents a motion-based extension to enhance the performance of the detection algorithm over video sequences. The results presented here suggest that this architecture may well be quite general.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1998.710772","publicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Computer Vision (IEEE Cat.

In this paper we present a new image representation which provides a transformation from the raw pixel data to a small set of image regions which are coherent in color and texture space. This so-called \"blobworld\" representation is based on segmentation using the expectation-maximization algorithm on combined color and texture features. The texture features we use for the segmentation arise from a new approach to texture description and scale selection. We describe a system that uses the blobworld representation to retrieve images. An important and unique aspect of the system is that, in the context of similarity-based querying, the user is allowed to view the internal representation of the submitted image and the query results. Similar systems do not offer the user this view into the workings of the system; consequently, the outcome of many queries on these systems can be quite inexplicable, despite the availability of knobs for adjusting the similarity metric.","displayPublicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Computer Vision (IEEE Cat.

The method is noniterative, local, and simple. It combines gray levels or colors based on both their geometric closeness and their photometric similarity, and prefers near values to distant values in both domain and range. In contrast with filters that operate on the three bands of a color image separately, a bilateral filter can enforce the perceptual metric underlying the CIE-Lab color space, and smooth colors and preserve edges in a way that is tuned to human perception. Also, in contrast with standard filtering, bilateral filtering produces no phantom colors along edges in color images, and reduces phantom colors where they appear in the original image.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1998.710815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1998.710815","startPage":"839","endPage":"846","publicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Computer Vision (IEEE Cat.

In each case, we present a derivation of the epipolar constraints. Next, we attempt to understand what can be seen by each system, and formalize the notion of field of view.

The important ingredient is that the gradient of the design criterion is computed from measured closed loop data. The approach is thus not model-based. The scheme converges to a stationary point of the design criterion under the assumption of boundedness of the signals in the loop. From a practical viewpoint, the scheme offers several advantages. It is straightforward to apply. It is possible to control the rate of change of the controller in each iteration. The objective can be manipulated between iterations in order to tighten or loosen performance requirements. Certain frequency regions can be emphasized if desired. This direct optimal tuning algorithm is particularly well suited for the tuning of the basic control loops in the process industry, which are typically PID loops. These primary loops are often very badly tuned, making the application of more advanced (for example, multivariable) techniques rather useless. A first requirement in the successful application of advanced control techniques is that the primary loops be tuned properly. This new technique appears to be a very practical way of doing this, with an almost automatic procedure.","doi":"10.1109/37.710876","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel4/5488303/15406/00710876.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/37.710876","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative feedback tuning: theory and applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=710876","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Iterative feedback tuning: theory and applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/710876/","publicationDate":"Aug. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6000193","volume":"18","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative feedback tuning: theory and applications","sourcePdf":"00710876.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037716S","chronDate":"Aug.  1998","isNumber":"15406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"570","articleId":"710876","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":710878,"authors":[{"name":"S.

AVDS is a two-level structure: the top decision level analyzes the traffic situation and determines a driving mode among several basic driving modes, while the bottom level computes the real-time control signal based on the chosen driving mode. An interface is introduced as a way of coupling decision and control levels. The bottom level uses predictive control to optimize the control objective provided by the top level, while considering passenger comfort and safety. In this way, the controller at the bottom level has the same structure across different driving modes. In addition, the proposed system is modular and extensible in the sense that it can accommodate each step in the evolutionary deployment by easily adding new rules into the decision, and incorporating additional real time information into the control.","doi":"10.1109/37.710878","pdfPath":"/iel4/5488303/15406/00710878.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"64","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/37.710878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Safety, comfort, and optimal tracking control in AHS applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/710878/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Safety, comfort, and optimal tracking control in AHS applications","volume":"18","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6000195","publicationDate":"Aug. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Safety, comfort, and optimal tracking control in AHS applications","sourcePdf":"00710878.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067999S","chronDate":"Aug.  1998","isNumber":"15406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"22","articleId":"710878","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":710882,"authors":[{"name":"S.G.

The main purpose of this system is to provide real time facilities for analyzing the acquired data, to generate necessary information for the dynamical adaptation of sample rates, and to deliver triggers when certain events in the plasma are detected. The hardware is built on a network of up to 72 transputers and up to four modules, each consisting of a PowerPC and a transputer coupled via dual-ported RAM. The transputers are used for collecting the incoming data from ADCs (each sampled with 500 KHz), and for communication and synchronization within the computer network. Four PowerPCs can analyze up to eight selected channels in real time and provide the results to the other transputers in the network. The algorithm running on the PowerPCs is performing a wavelet like time-frequency transform for the detection of plasma events. With this system it was possible to observe high-n/m mode cascades following impurity accumulation. A report on this effect has been published in Physical Review Letters.","doi":"10.1109/23.710954","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel4/23/15326/00710954.pdf","startPage":"1872","endPage":"1876","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.710954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real time data acquisition with transputers and PowerPCs using the wavelet transform for event detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=710954","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/710954/","displayDocTitle":"Real time data acquisition with transputers and PowerPCs using the wavelet transform for event detection","volume":"45","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 1998","accessionNumber":"6018566","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real time data acquisition with transputers and PowerPCs using the wavelet transform for event detection","sourcePdf":"00710954.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03231S","chronDate":"Aug.  1998","isNumber":"15326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"6","articleId":"710954","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":711081,"authors":[{"name":"Changjiang Yang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Changjiang Yang","id":"37068350000"},{"name":"Zhanyi Hu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhanyi Hu","id":"37281086500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-8512-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"711081","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine vision","Cameras","Calibration","Motion control","Laboratories","Pattern recognition","Automation","Analytical models","Stereo vision","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active vision","self-adjusting systems","calibration","stereo image processing","motion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["camera self-calibration","active vision system","intrinsic parameters","pan-tilt-translation platform","camera motion configuration","orthogonal directions","orientation","stereo vision"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new camera intrinsic parameters self-calibration technique for an ordinary active vision system.

For the four-class problem (with two similar classes combined into the same class), classification error can be reduced to 5.2%. The results are better than those of the fingerprint classification systems created by Karu and Jian (1996) and by Blue et al. (1994).

The relationship between the projection distance method which is based on the K-L expansion and three layered autoassociative networks is discussed, and it is shown that the three and five layered autoassociative networks are superior to the projection distance method. In the handwritten numeral recognition experiment, a total of 44862 numeral samples collected by IPTP are used to evaluate and compare the recognition rates of the autoassociative networks, the mutual associative network, the nearest neighbor method, and the projection distance method. The five layered autoassociative networks achieved the highest recognition rate in the handwritten numeral recognition experiment. The result of experiment together with the fundamental study show that the autoassociative networks have such characteristics that: (1) class independent training makes the possibility of local convergence less than that of the mutual associative network, (2) the networks possess the higher ability of dimension reduction and interpolation than the nearest neighbor method (3) they yield less misclassification due to subspace sharing than the projection method, (4) the five layered autoassociative network can fit a curved hypersurface to a distribution of patterns.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.1998.711106","startPage":"166","endPage":"171 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The method absorbs the local variations in handprinting by using the property of the wavelet transform. It is expected that the representation in multiresolution analysis (MRA) with low resolution can absorb the local variation in handprinting than in MRA with high resolution. Furthermore, the representation can detect the horizontal edge and the vertical edge in the original image of a character which are effective in recognition, respectively. Because of these advantageous properties, that is, the capability of absorbing the local variation in handprinting and the ability of detecting the edge lines, we construct the feature vector for recognition by using the wavelet representation in MRA. The performance of the proposed method is superior to that of the directional pattern matching method which is a representative traditional method.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.1998.711123","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

As a result, the corresponding model is extracted and located from the image. The proposed algorithm can be used for the recognition of objects whose scales, rotations and translations are unknown. In addition, the algorithm can locate objects whose boundaries are distorted.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.1998.711124","pdfPath":"/iel4/5726/15317/00711124.pdf","startPage":"233","endPage":"237 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

For an input pattern which is an overlapped superposition of several stored patterns the proposed model network is shown to be capable of segmenting out each pattern one after another as the network evolves its temporal dynamics. The temporal segmentation attains its optimal performance at an intermediate noise intensity and the performance becomes improved as the coupling strength between oscillators increases. A mechanism for the selective attention is also introduced in the STONN by controlling the level of noise applied to the most salient pattern and by adopting the inhibition-of-return into the patterns that have been segmented before.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/711130/","accessionNumber":"6091155","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-20 Aug. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Temporal segmentation and selective attention in the stochastic oscillator neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temporal segmentation and selective attention in the stochastic oscillator neural network","confLoc":"Brisbane, Queensland, Australia","sourcePdf":"00711130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027658S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug 1998","isNumber":"15317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5726","articleId":"711130","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":711137,"authors":[{"name":"F.J.

Its most unusual feature, invertibility, is also one of its most useful features. The many advantages of DIEM are described.

Surgical removal of a newly developed melanoma will result in complete cure. In this study, the first steps towards the development of a skin cancer detection system are reported. One possible way to detect early the occurrence of melanoma is to screen the body of a patient at regular intervals for changes or new lesions. To increase the accuracy of this laborious and painstaking task, a computer vision system could be used. One of the most important problems involved in a vision system of this kind is the need to determine which lesions in successive skin images taken over a given period, represent the same lesions. Repeated registrations of skin images also detect new lesions that do not have a counterpart on the previous image. After registration, the lesions in successive images are compared for alterations in size, shape, colour and so on, to detect changes that are suggestive of melanoma. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm for the registration of lesions in successive skin images. The baseline algorithm requires two initial matches to register the other lesions in the images. The initial matches are provided by a physician or an algorithm that selects the most likely initial matches. The test suggests that the baseline algorithm determines 99% of the matches correctly, and this performance is largely independent of the number of lesions in the skin images.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.1998.711152","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The matching is under translation, but it can cover more general transformations by generating the various transformed templates explicitly. The novel part of the algorithm is that, in addition to a coarse-to-fine search over the translation parameters, the N templates are grouped off-line into a template hierarchy based on their similarity. This way, multiple templates can be matched simultaneously at the coarse levels of the search, resulting in various speed-up factors. Furthermore, in matching, features are distinguished by type and separate DTs are computed for each type (e.g. based on edge orientations). These concepts are illustrated in the application of traffic sign detection.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.1998.711175","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The sensor system takes an omnidirectional view by a component constructed of six cameras and a hexagonal pyramidal mirror and acquires stereo views by symmetrically connecting two sensor components. The paper describes a method of generating stereo panoramic images by using our sensor. First, the sensor system is calibrated; that is, twelve cameras are correctly aligned with pyramidal mirrors and the Tsai's method restores the radial distortion of each camera image. Stereo panoramic images are then computed by registering the camera images captured at the same time.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Each vision system consists of a camera and an image processor and they are all connected through a computer network. In this paper, we propose a method for human tracking and for coordination of all the vision systems. The human tracking method works on each vision system and uses a type of model based template matching to track moving people at 15 frame/sec on a standard personal computer. Coordination between the vision systems is necessary to achieve consistent wide area tracking. We use a state transition map and several action rules to synchronize the image processing between systems. All the vision systems share the state transition map jointly and decide their own actions according to the action rules. We describe experimental results that show the validity of our approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human tracking using distributed vision systems","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Text either embedded or superimposed within video frames is very useful for describing the contents of the frames, as it enables both keyword and free-text based search, automatic video logging, and video cataloging. We have developed a scheme for automatically extracting text from digital images and videos for content annotation and retrieval. We present our approach to robust text extraction from video frames, which can handle complex image backgrounds, deal with different font sizes, font styles, and font appearances such as normal and inverse video. Our algorithm results in segmented characters that can be directly processed by an OCR system to produce ASCII text. Results from our experiments with over 5000 frames obtained from twelve MPEG video streams demonstrate the good performance of our system in terms of text identification accuracy and computational efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.1998.711219","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The multidimensional vectors may be feature vectors from an initial database of images, signals, or other data. The decision regions may be the classes into which the user assigns these data. The decision regions define classes that may only partially overlap some of the clusters. Thus the visual neural network classifies each vector in the database and at the same time maps the vector into a point in a two-dimensional display. When points in the display correspond to perceptually similar items in the initial data. When presented with a \"query\" from the initial data, a user call search for items similar to the query by examining the raw data represented by points in the same class as the query or by examining nearby points. In this way a user can efficiently browse a database and be assured of accessing related items. Information gained from browsing the database can be used to evaluate the network's classification decision. We show in an application to medical radiology that a visual neural network can learn a good compromise between perceptual grouping and classification.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.1998.711289","startPage":"873","endPage":"875 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

This process is the source of inspiration for the Embryonics (embryonic electronics) project, whose final objective is the conception of very large scale integrated circuits endowed with properties usually associated with the living world: self-repair (cicatrization) and self-replication. We begin by showing that any logic system can be represented by an ordered binary decision diagram (OBDD), and then embedded into a fine-grained field-programmable gate array (FPGA) whose basic cell is a multiplexer with programmable connections. The cellular array thus obtained is perfectly homogeneous: the function of each cell is defined by a configuration (or gene) and all the genes in the array, each associated with a pair of coordinates, make up the blueprint (or genome) of the artificial organism. In the second part of the project, we add to the basic cell a memory and an interpreter to, respectively, store and decode the complete genome. The interpreter extracts from the genome the gene of a particular cell as a function of its position in the array (its coordinates) and thus determines the exact configuration of the relative multiplexer. The considerable redundancy introduced by the presence of a genome in each cell has significant advantages: self-replication (the automatic production of one or more copies of the original organism) and self-repair (the automatic repair of one or more faulty cells) become relatively simple operations. The multiplexer-based FPGA cell and the interpreter are finally embedded into an electronic module; an array of such modules make it possible to demonstrate self-repair and self-replication.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Embryonics: a new methodology for designing field-programmable gate arrays with self-repair and self-replicating properties","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/92.711310","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/15418/00711310.pdf","startPage":"387","endPage":"399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.711310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15418","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=711310","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/711310/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Embryonics: a new methodology for designing field-programmable gate arrays with self-repair and self-replicating properties","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","accessionNumber":"6020024","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embryonics: a new methodology for designing field-programmable gate arrays with self-repair and self-replicating properties","sourcePdf":"00711310.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030092S","chronDate":"Sept.  1998","isNumber":"15418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"67","articleId":"711310","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":711315,"authors":[{"name":"V.

A long-standing open question for both FPGA's and channeled gate arrays is whether or not some uneven distribution of routing tracks across the chip would lead to an area benefit. For example, many circuit designers intuitively believe that most congestion occurs near the center of a chip, and hence expect that having wider routing channels near the chip center would be beneficial. In this paper, we determine the relative area-efficiency of several different routing track distributions. We first investigate FPGA's in which horizontal and vertical channels contain different numbers of tracks in order to determine if such a directional bias provides a density advantage. Second, we examine routing track distributions in which the track capacities vary from channel to channel. We compare the area efficiency of these nonuniform routing architectures to that of an FPGA with uniform channel capacities across the entire chip. The main result is that the most area-efficient global routing architecture is one with uniform (or very nearly uniform) channel capacities across the entire chip in both the horizontal and vertical directions. This paper shows why this result, which is contrary to the intuition of many FPGA architects, is true. While a uniform routing architecture is the most area-efficient, several nonuniform and directionally biased architectures are fairly area-efficient provided that appropriate choices are made for the pin positions on the logic blocks and the logic block array aspect ratio.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Field programmable gate arrays","Circuits","Programmable logic arrays","Channel capacity","Logic arrays","Manufacturing","Costs","Logic programming","Wiring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network routing","field programmable gate arrays","logic CAD","circuit layout CAD","wiring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["prefabricated routing track distribution","FPGA area-efficiency","wiring tracks","uneven distribution","routing channels","directional bias","nonuniform routing architectures","global routing architecture","channel capacities","pin positions","logic block array aspect ratio"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=711315","doi":"10.1109/92.711315","startPage":"445","endPage":"456","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/15418/00711315.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15418","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.711315","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/711315/","displayDocTitle":"Effect of the prefabricated routing track distribution on FPGA area-efficiency","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1998","volume":"6","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6025554","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of the prefabricated routing track distribution on FPGA area-efficiency","sourcePdf":"00711315.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038826S","chronDate":"Sept.  1998","isNumber":"15418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"18","articleId":"711315","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":711317,"authors":[{"name":"W.P.

This is in good agreement with expected focal plane array sensitivity due to the practical limitations on charge handling capacity of the multiplexer, read noise, bias voltage, and operating temperature.","doi":"10.1109/16.711352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15420","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.711352","endPage":"1895","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel4/16/15420/00711352.pdf","startPage":"1890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Long-wavelength 640/spl times/486 GaAs-AlGaAs quantum well infrared photodetector snap-shot camera","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/711352/","displayDocTitle":"Long-wavelength 640/spl times/486 GaAs-AlGaAs quantum well infrared photodetector snap-shot camera","volume":"45","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"6013566","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long-wavelength 640/spl times/486 GaAs-AlGaAs quantum well infrared photodetector snap-shot camera","sourcePdf":"00711352.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066284S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"68","articleId":"711352","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":711353,"authors":[{"name":"M.C.

Continued scaling of design rules will further aggravate this problem. Vertical integration of devices will enable a substantial reduction in chip size and thus in interconnect delay. We present a novel technique to achieve vertical integration of CMOS devices. Germanium is used as a seeding agent at the source and/or drain of thin film transistors (TFTs) to laterally crystallize amorphous silicon films, resulting in high-performance devices. This is achieved through the formation of large grain polysilicon with a precise control over the location of the grain. TFTs have been demonstrated offering substantial performance improvement over conventional unseeded polycrystalline TFTs, with demonstrated mobilities as high as 300 cm2/V-s. The process is fully CMOS compatible and has a low thermal budget. It is highly scalable to deep-submicron technologies and, with suitable optimization, should enable the production of high-performance, high density, vertically integrated ULSI.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel4/16/15420/00711358.pdf","startPage":"1934","endPage":"1939","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/16.711358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.711358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15420","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=711358","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-performance germanium-seeded laterally crystallized TFTs for vertical device integration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Crystallization","Thin film transistors","Delay","Optimized production technology","Germanium","Amorphous silicon","Semiconductor films","CMOS process","CMOS technology","Ultra large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thin film transistors","germanium","crystallisation","carrier mobility","elemental semiconductors","silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["germanium seeding","CMOS device","thin film transistor","lateral crystallization","amorphous silicon film","polysilicon","carrier mobility","TFT","vertical integration","solid phase crystallization","Ge","Si"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/711358/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","displayDocTitle":"High-performance germanium-seeded laterally crystallized TFTs for vertical device integration","volume":"45","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","accessionNumber":"6018535","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-performance germanium-seeded laterally crystallized TFTs for vertical device integration","sourcePdf":"00711358.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044873S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"70","articleId":"711358","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":711362,"authors":[{"name":"P.A.

A new analytical model describing dopant fluctuations in the active device area enables the derivation of the standard deviation, /spl sigma/V/sub T/, of the threshold voltage distribution for arbitrary channel doping profiles. Using the MINIMOS device simulator to extend the analytical approach, it is found that /spl sigma/V/sub T/, can be properly derived from two-dimensional (2-D) or three-dimensional (3-D) simulations using a relatively coarse simulation grid. Evaluating the threshold voltage shift arising from dopant fluctuations, on the other hand, calls for full 3-D simulations with a numerical grid that is sufficiently refined to represent the discrete nature of the dopant distribution. The average V/sub T/-shift is found to be positive for long, narrow devices, and negative for short, wide devices. The fast 2-D MINIMOS modeling of dopant fluctuations enables an extensive statistical analysis of the intrinsic spreading in a large set of compact model parameters for state-of-the-art CMOS technology. It is predicted that V/sub T/-variations due to dopant fluctuations become unacceptably large in CMOS generations of 0.18 /spl mu/m and beyond when the present scaling scenarios are pursued. Parameter variations can be drastically reduced by using alternative device designs with ground-plane channel profiles.","doi":"10.1109/16.711362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.711362","startPage":"1960","endPage":"1971","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel4/16/15420/00711362.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling statistical dopant fluctuations in MOS transistors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/711362/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","displayDocTitle":"Modeling statistical dopant fluctuations in MOS transistors","volume":"45","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6018536","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling statistical dopant fluctuations in MOS transistors","sourcePdf":"00711362.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045966S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"303","articleId":"711362","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-29"},{"_id":711446,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Aboul-Dahab","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport, Alexandria, Egypt"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Aboul-Dahab","id":"38277412000"},{"name":"K.A.

Applying these algorithms to AAA results in limited performance, due to slow convergence rates and increased computational complexity. The high cost required is another factor that should be taken into consideration. From another point of view, the synthesis of linear arrays to produce highly reduced sidelobes is a problem of similar complexity and limitations. This paper suggests a new synthesis technique for antenna array systems based on a trained neural network (NN). In particular, the output of a linear array is processed by two NNs, The simulation results show that the NN, when trained to minimize the sidelobe levels of the array, results in highly improved patterns with very deep sidelobes. This method substitutes other tedious conventional algorithms that are usually used in adaptive antenna arrays and array synthesis.","doi":"10.1109/NRSC.1998.711446","startPage":"B1/1","endPage":"B1/8","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fifteenth National Radio Science Conference.

In this paper, we study the pre-RAKE system with DPSK modulation for multi-user communications in a Rayleigh fading channel. The system performance is analyzed in a generalized Rayleigh fading multipath channel. Two diversity-combining techniques, namely, maximal ratio combing (MRC), equal gain combing (EGG) and zero forcing equalization (ZFE) are considered Both diversity types are supplemented by selection diversity for the strongest paths in gain. We also consider the effect of imperfect channel estimation on the system performance and compare the results with the case of coherent QPSK pre-RAKE system.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fifteenth National Radio Science Conference.

A fractional factorial experiment is used to systematically characterize the growth of a five-layer, undoped AlGaAs-InGaAs single quantum well structure on a GaAs substrate as a function of time and temperature for oxide removal, substrate temperatures for AlGaAs and InGaAs layer growth, beam equivalent pressure of the As source and quantum well interrupt time. MBE growth takes place in a Varian Gen-II MBE system using substrate rotation, and RHEED signals are monitored for each experimental trial. RHEED pattern variation is used as an indicator of defect density, X-ray diffraction, and photoluminescence of the grown films. Principal component analysis is used to reduce the dimensionality of the RHEED data set, while maintaining the integrity of the information contained within. The reduced RHEED data set is used to train back-propagation neural networks to model the process responses. These models are quite accurate (about 3% RMSE on training data and less than 10% RMSE for test data), implying that the principal components are a reliable source of input data. Continued development will lead to models which provide a platform upon which to build an automated process control system for MBE growth.","doi":"10.1109/ISCS.1998.711537","startPage":"33","endPage":"36","publicationTitle":"Compound Semiconductors 1997.

Due to the fact that FPGAs are mainly characterized both by high integration rate and \"reprogrammability\", they are useful for complex image processing. However, fast processing is not possible without parallel processing; also traditional integration methods are not sufficient enough. Thus, one possible way is to adapt the processing algorithm to the FPGA architecture and to avoid general methods of schematic description, allowing an easily implantation, but not an optimum partitioning-routing. With this aim, we tried to minimize the number of CLBs (configurable logic block) in the FPGA, to integrate logical functions (addition, multiplication, comparison etc.) dedicated to segmentation, classification, as well as filtering operations. This is done by expressing the whole \"architecture-function to integrate\" as Boolean constraints.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/711587/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Jul 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"6027731","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-10 July 1998","isConference":true,"volume":"2","displayDocTitle":"Methods of logical functions decomposition for LUT-based FPGA","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Methods of logical functions decomposition for LUT-based FPGA","confLoc":"Pretoria, South Africa","sourcePdf":"00711587.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058928S","chronDate":"7-10 Jul 1998","isNumber":"15303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5707","articleId":"711587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":711593,"authors":[{"name":"I.D. de Vries","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa"],"firstName":"I.D.","lastName":"de Vries","id":"37373510500"},{"name":"J.H. van Nierop","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa"],"firstName":"J.H.","lastName":"van Nierop","id":"37373534000"},{"name":"J.R.

Class DE differs in that the method of operation utilises the devices output capacitance to obtain zero voltage, zero current switching transitions. Hence switching losses (and switching EMI) can be very low, permitting operation to a high frequency. This paper presents the problems, solutions, results and feasibility of a Class DE inverter as an RF power source for frequencies up to 5 MHz and a power of 1 kW. At this frequency, the theoretical design requirements put some tight restrictions on dead time, phase and output capacitance. This presents some formidable problems in practically implementing the inverter. The most significant problems are: the gate drive circuitry including layout, isolation of the high side gate drive, nanosecond control of dead time, synchronization of high and low side gate drive pulses, phase control of the driving voltage and general layout of the power devices. Some novel solutions to the above problems are described. The simulation and experimental results are presented and the practical power and frequency limits of a Class DE inverter are discussed. The information presented should be useful in applications such as MHz DC-DC power converters, RF power sources for industrial heating and AM transmitters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/711593/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Jul 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6027736","conferenceDate":"7-10 July 1998","displayDocTitle":"Solid state class DE RF power source","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solid state class DE RF power source","confLoc":"Pretoria, South Africa","sourcePdf":"00711593.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030287S","chronDate":"7-10 Jul 1998","isNumber":"15303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5707","citationCount":"27","articleId":"711593","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":711666,"authors":[{"name":"J.P.

These concepts include the mixed selection mechanisms, deterministic crossover and mutation operators, pseudo-random construction of the initial population, evolution of the operator application probabilities as the computation progresses, etc. In the paper, an effective and efficient GA scheme is proposed and applied for solving an important design problem: the minimal input support problem (MISP). In almost all cases, our GA produces strictly optimal results and realizes the best trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that the proposed GA scheme is suitable for solving synthesis problems and its application results in very effective and efficient genetic synthesis algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/EURMIC.1998.711766","startPage":"1","endPage":"7 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 24th EUROMICRO Conference (Cat.

Its practical usefulness for very complex systems is, however, limited by the lack of an effective and efficient method for selection of the appropriate input supports for subsystems. A classical method based on a systematic search of the whole solution space is inefficient. In this paper, an effective heuristic method for input support selection is proposed and discussed. The method is based on application of information relationship measures, which allows us to reduce the search space to a manageable size while keeping high-quality solutions in the reduced space. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed heuristic method is able to construct optimal or near-optimal supports efficiently, even for large systems.

This circumstance limits their extensive application in industrial processes. With the aim of overcoming this fact, a low-cost image processor has been implemented. This specific single-board processor permits a standard industrial PC to perform the tracking of some relevant local features at video rate (50 Hz). Local features in the image are transformed to a polar representation in order to simplify the recognition and location processes prior to rotations. This transformation is provided in real time by the presented image processor, so the host only has to apply the recognition algorithm. For image processor implementation, FPGA technology has been used.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 24th EUROMICRO Conference (Cat.

In order to reduce the time-to-market it becomes essential to allow designers to evaluate performances of a given application with the targetted architecture very soon in the design phase. So we have decided to build a modelling simulation environment in order to evaluate the requisite number of cycles for processing a given application with a simple model of a digital hardware architecture. Then, our main objective and the greatest part of our work is to describe this environment with an example based on the Pine DSP and some classical digital signal processing applications: FIR, FFT butterfly, Viterbi's Butterfly.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 24th EUROMICRO Conference (Cat.

The authors have developed rectilinear Steiner regions (RSR), a new fast algorithm to approximate the rectilinear Steiner minimum tree (RSMT) of each multi-terminal net. The search of placement solutions is performed in three simulated annealing optimization phases, guided by different objective functions. The first one uses a semi-perimeter classic metric to reduce the length of the nets. The second one estimates more precisely the length of the nets with RSR algorithm. The third stage measures the congestion making a fast routing of RSR regions in each placement iteration. They have also developed an RSR-based global router. This optimization method has been applied for the placement and global routing of a set of benchmark circuits. The layouts obtained, require equal or fewer routing tracks per channel segment than those produced by other tools appeared in the literature, that only optimize the semi-perimeter classic placement cost function.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 24th EUROMICRO Conference (Cat.

The paper presents two main memory check pointing schemes that can be used in any parallel machine without requiring any change to the hardware: one scheme saves the checkpoints in the memory of other processors, while the other is based on a parity approach. Both techniques have been implemented and evaluated in a commercial parallel machine.

At the first level, a face image is represented as a linear combination (LC) of a set of basis vectors, i.e. eigenfaces. Thereby a face image corresponds to a feature vector (prototype) in the eigenface space. Normally several such prototypes are available for a face class, each representing the face under a particular condition such as in viewpoint, illumination, and so on. We propose to use the second level LC, that of the prototypes belonging to the same face class, to treat the prototypes coherently. The purpose is to improve face recognition under a new condition not captured by the prototypes by using a linear combination of them. A new distance measure called nearest LC (NLC) is proposed as opposed to the NN. Experiments show that our method yields significantly better results than the one level eigenface methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.1998.711910","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.1998.711910","endPage":"1193 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

We show that especially the latter requirement is highly complicated and demanding, if we allow the user to move in front of the camera without any restrictions and to perform the gestures spontaneously at any arbitrary moment.

Such a representation is closely related to the techniques of independent component analysis and blind source separation. In this paper, we investigate the application of sparse coding for image feature extraction. We show how sparse coding can be used to extract wavelet-like features from natural image data. As an application of such a feature extraction scheme, we show how to apply a soft-thresholding operator on the components of sparse coding in order to reduce Gaussian noise. Methods based on sparse coding have the important benefit over wavelet methods that the features are determined solely by the statistical properties of the data, while the wavelet transformation relies heavily on certain abstract mathematical properties that may be only weakly related to the properties of the natural data.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.1998.711932","pdfPath":"/iel4/5726/15322/00711932.pdf","startPage":"1268","endPage":"1273 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The recognition is based on the characteristic motion of the legs of a pedestrian walking parallel to the image plane. Each image is segmented into region-like image parts by clustering pixels in a combined color/position feature space. The proposed clustering technique implies matching of corresponding clusters in consecutive frames and therefore allows clusters to be tracked over a sequence of images. Based on the observation of clusters over time a two-stage classifier extracts those clusters which most likely represent the legs of pedestrians. A fast polynomial classifier performs a rough preselection of clusters by evaluating temporal changes of a shape-dependent clusters feature. The final classification is done by a time delay neural network (TDNN) with spatio-temporal receptive fields.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.1998.711946","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

We demonstrate that setting this parameter according to the pixel length of the observation sequence, rather than using a fixed value for all input data, results in a faster and more accurate system. Best results were achieved by setting the maximum number of levels to twice the estimated number of characters in the input string. We also describe experiments which show the potential for further improvement by using an adaptive termination criterion in the LB search.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The proposed approach models words with ergodic HMMs and is designed for small vocabularies. A single neural network provides grapheme observation probabilities for all HMMs in order to compute the most likely word model. During the iterative EM like training of the hybrid, the HMMs provide the targets for the discriminant training of the neural network. An extension of the approach to letter models which can be concatenated in order to form word models and which allow for large vocabularies is also briefly discussed.

It uses a combination of 2 segmentation free word recognition schemes. The first scheme uses a set of global features associated to a modified K nearest neighbour classifier; while the second one uses a set of directional contour features as input to an HMM. The system has been designed to be modular and independent of specific languages as in Canada one has to deal with at least 2 languages, namely English and French. It can be easily adapted to read other European languages based on the Roman alphabet. The system is continuously tested on data from the local phone company, and we report here the results on a database of approximately 4,500 cheques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HMM-KNN word recognition engine for bank cheque processing","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Since the quality of fingerprint images is often low, automatic minutiae detection is a very difficult task and the extraction algorithms produce a large number of false alarms. We present an approach to minutiae filtering based on a neural network. The minutiae neighborhoods extracted by the algorithm presented by us (1997) are normalized with respect to rotation and scale, and their dimensionality is reduced via a KL transform. A neural classifier, whose topology has been designed to exploit the minutiae duality, is employed to perform the neighborhoods classification. The filtering proposed, as confirmed by simulations, allows a significant improvement in the overall performance to be achieved.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.1998.712036","pdfPath":"/iel4/5726/15322/00712036.pdf","startPage":"1654","endPage":"1658 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The approach proposed here, PRIMA, is a general method for obtaining passive reduced-order macromodels for linear RLC systems.

As problem sizes reach new levels of complexity, a single application of a clustering algorithm is insufficient to produce excellent solutions. Recent work has illustrated the promise of multilevel approaches. A multilevel partitioning algorithm recursively clusters the instance until its size is smaller than a given threshold, then unclusters the instance, while applying a partitioning refinement algorithm. In this paper, we propose a new multilevel partitioning algorithm that exploits some of the latest innovations of classical iterative partitioning approaches. Our method also uses a new technique to control the number of levels in our matching-based clustering algorithm. Experimental results show that our heuristic outperforms numerous existing bipartitioning heuristics with improvements ranging from 6.9 to 27.9% for 100 runs and 3.0 to 20.6% for just ten runs (while also using less CPU time). Further, our algorithm generates solutions better than the best known mincut bipartitionings for seven of the ACM/SIGDA benchmark circuits, including golem3 (which has over 100000 cells). We also present quadrisection results which compare favorably to the partitionings obtained by the GORDIAN cell placement tool. Our work in multilevel quadrisection has been used as the basis for an effective cell placement package.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/43/15438/00712098.pdf","startPage":"655","endPage":"667","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/43.712098","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.712098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15438","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=712098","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilevel circuit partitioning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuits","Clustering algorithms","Partitioning algorithms","Iterative algorithms","Iterative methods","Associate members","Technological innovation","Central Processing Unit","Packaging","Design optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit layout","circuit layout CAD","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilevel circuit partitioning","bipartitioning","clustering algorithm","iterative partitioning","matching","quadrisection","cell placement","IC design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/712098/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1998","displayDocTitle":"Multilevel circuit partitioning","volume":"17","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1998","accessionNumber":"6035686","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilevel circuit partitioning","sourcePdf":"00712098.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031772S","chronDate":"Aug 1998","isNumber":"15438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"53","articleId":"712098","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":712099,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Kan Cheng","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA","IBM Motorola Somerset Design Center, Austin, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Yi-Kan Cheng","id":"37350416900"},{"name":"P.

The circuit configured into our system that emulates the faulty circuit's behaviour is synthesized from the good circuit and the given fault list in a novel way. Fault injection is made easy by shifting the content of a fault injection scan chain or by selecting the output of a parallel fault injection selector, with which we get rid of the time-consuming bit-stream regeneration process. Experimental results for ISCAS-89 benchmark circuits show that our serial fault emulator is about 20 times faster than HOPE. The speedup grows with the circuit size by our analysis. Two hybrid fault emulation approaches are also proposed. The first reduces the number of faults actually emulated by screening off faults not activated or with short propagation distances before emulation, and by collapsing nonstem faults into their equivalent stem faults. The second reduces the hardware requirement of the fault emulator by incorporating an ordinary fault simulator.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential circuit fault simulation using logic emulation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/43.712103","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/43/15438/00712103.pdf","startPage":"724","endPage":"736","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.712103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15438","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=712103","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/712103/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1998","displayDocTitle":"Sequential circuit fault simulation using logic emulation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1998","accessionNumber":"6041722","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential circuit fault simulation using logic emulation","sourcePdf":"00712103.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037888S","chronDate":"Aug 1998","isNumber":"15438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"48","articleId":"712103","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":712105,"authors":[{"name":"L.

By feeding back the bias estimate into the VCM amplifier, the frequency response from the VCM current to the carriage angular acceleration is linearized to be a constant gain within the observer bandwidth.

Accurate reconstruction of continuous or discrete tomographic images requires full knowledge of the Radon transform in the corresponding n-D sinogram space. In practice, however, one can have only a finite set of discrete samples of the Radon transform in the sinogram space. One often derives the desired full knowledge of the Radon transform from its discrete samples by invoking various interpolation algorithms. According to the Wittaker-Shannon sampling theorem, a necessary condition for a full and unique recovery of the Radon transform from its discrete samples is that the Radon transform itself be bandlimited. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the bandlimited properties of the Radon transform. In this work, the authors analyze explicitly the bandlimited properties of the Radon transform and show that the Radon transform is mathematically quasi-bandlimited [or essentially bandlimited] in two quantitative senses and can essentially be treated as bandlimited in practice. The quasi-bandlimited properties can be used for increasing the angular sampling density of the Radon transform.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.712129","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/15439/00712129.pdf","startPage":"395","endPage":"406","doi":"10.1109/42.712129","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quasi-bandlimited properties of Radon transforms and their implications for increasing angular sampling densities","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1998","displayDocTitle":"Quasi-bandlimited properties of Radon transforms and their implications for increasing angular sampling densities","volume":"17","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1998","accessionNumber":"6022507","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"9735903","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/712129/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quasi-bandlimited properties of Radon transforms and their implications for increasing angular sampling densities","sourcePdf":"00712129.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03077S","chronDate":"June  1998","isNumber":"15439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"4","articleId":"712129","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":712134,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

In \"normal\" human metaphase spreads, chromosomes occur in homologous pairs for the autosomal classes 1-22, and X chromosome for females. Many existing approaches for performing automated human chromosome image analysis presuppose cell normalcy, containing 46 chromosomes within a metaphase spread with two chromosomes per class. This is an acceptable assumption for routine automated chromosome image analysis. However, many genetic abnormalities are directly linked to structural or numerical aberrations of chromosomes within the metaphase spread. Thus, two chromosomes per class cannot be assumed for anomaly analysis. This paper presents the development of image analysis techniques which are extendible to detecting numerical aberrations evolving from structural abnormalities. Specifically, an approach to identifying \"normal\" chromosomes from selected class(es) within a metaphase spread is presented. Chromosome assignment to a specific class is initially based on neural networks, followed by banding pattern and centromeric index criteria checking, and concluding with homologue matching. Experimental results are presented comparing neural networks as the sole classifier to the authors' homologue matcher for identifying class 17 within normal and abnormal metaphase spreads.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/712134/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1998","accessionNumber":"6028793","pubMedId":"9735908","volume":"17","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Data-driven homologue matching for chromosome identification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-driven homologue matching for chromosome identification","sourcePdf":"00712134.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060593S","chronDate":"June  1998","isNumber":"15439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"38","articleId":"712134","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":712135,"authors":[{"name":"D.L.

Although the algorithm must be evaluated on real data, a comprehensive validation requires the additional use of simulated data since it is impossible to establish ground truth with in vivo data. Experiments with simulated data permit controlled evaluation over a wide range of conditions (e.g., different levels of noise, contrast, intensity artefacts, or geometric distortion). Such considerations have become increasingly important with the rapid growth of neuroimaging, i.e., computational analysis of brain structure and function using brain scanning methods such as positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Since simple objects such as ellipsoids or parallelepipedes do not reflect the complexity of natural brain anatomy, the authors present the design and creation of a realistic, high-resolution, digital, volumetric phantom of the human brain. This three-dimensional digital brain phantom is made up of ten volumetric data sets that define the spatial distribution for different tissues (e.g., grey matter, white matter, muscle, skin, etc.), where voxel intensity is proportional to the fraction of tissue within the voxel. The digital brain phantom can be used to simulate tomographic images of the head. Since the contribution of each tissue type to each voxel in the brain phantom is known, it can be used as the gold standard to test analysis algorithms such as classification procedures which seek to identify the tissue \"type\" of each image voxel. Furthermore, since the same anatomical phantom may be used to drive simulators for different modalities, it is the ideal tool to test intermodality registration algorithms. The brain phantom and simulated MR images have been made publicly available on the Internet (http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/brainweb).","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/15439/00712135.pdf","startPage":"463","endPage":"468","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/42.712135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.712135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15439","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=712135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and construction of a realistic digital brain phantom","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Imaging phantoms","Brain modeling","Algorithm design and analysis","Image analysis","Testing","Biomedical image processing","Medical simulation","In vivo","Computational modeling","Solid modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain","medical image processing","positron emission tomography","biomedical NMR"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["realistic digital brain phantom","design","construction","medical image processing algorithm","comprehensive validation","in vivo data","simulated data","noise","contrast","intensity artefacts","geometric distortion","neuroimaging","computational analysis","brain scanning methods","ellipsoids","parallelepipedes","natural brain anatomy complexity","realistic high-resolution digital volumetric phantom","grey matter","white matter","muscle","skin","voxel intensity","head tomographic images simulation","intermodality registration algorithms testing"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Brain","Computer Graphics","Computer Simulation","Humans","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Tomography, Emission-Computed"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/712135/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1998","displayDocTitle":"Design and construction of a realistic digital brain phantom","volume":"17","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1998","accessionNumber":"6028794","pubMedId":"9735909","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and construction of a realistic digital brain phantom","sourcePdf":"00712135.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058823S","chronDate":"June  1998","isNumber":"15439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"1223","articleId":"712135","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":712136,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In the present work the Monte Carlo optimization process is described and theoretical yields are calculated for the COSL 2- and 3-bit encoder circuits. The circuit simulations use 5-10-GHz sinusoidal clocks and measured global and local process variations. The 2-bit encoder results are compared to modified variable threshold logic (MVTL) circuits and demonstrate that COSL circuits should have a significantly higher theoretical yield than MVTL at 10 Gb/s. Design rules for optimal COSL circuit layouts are also given, and experimental data are presented for 2-bit encoder circuits operating at multigigahertz clock frequencies.

Traditional methods employed in language analysis have focused on developing powerful formalisms to represent syntactic or semantic structures along with rules for transforming language into these formalisms. However, they make use of only small subsets of knowledge. This article describes how to use the whole range of information through a neurosymbolic architecture which is a hybridization of a symbolic network and subsymbol vectors generated from a connectionist network. Besides initializing the symbolic network with prior knowledge, the subsymbol vectors are used to enhance the system's capability in disambiguation and provide flexibility in sentence understanding. The model captures a diversity of information including word associations, syntactic restrictions, case-role expectations, semantic rules and context. It attains highly interactive processing by representing knowledge in an associative network on which actual semantic inferences are performed. An integrated use of previously analyzed sentences in understanding is another important feature of our model. The model dynamically selects one hypothesis among multiple hypotheses. This notion is supported by three simulations which show the degree of disambiguation relies both on the amount of linguistic rules and the semantic-associative information available to support the inference processes in natural language understanding. Unlike many similar systems, our hybrid system is more sophisticated in tackling language disambiguation problems by using linguistic clues from disparate sources as well as modeling context effects into the sentence analysis. It is potentially more powerful than any systems relying on one processing paradigm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/712149/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1998","volume":"9","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","accessionNumber":"6024802","pubMedId":"18255763","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Symbolic connectionism in natural language disambiguation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbolic connectionism in natural language disambiguation","sourcePdf":"00712149.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067343S","chronDate":"Sept.  1998","isNumber":"15435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"12","articleId":"712149","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":712150,"authors":[{"name":"W.A.

In this paper, a linguistic (qualitative) modeling approach is proposed. The approach combines the merits of the fuzzy logic theory, neural networks, and genetic algorithms (GAs). The proposed model is presented in a fuzzy-neural network (FNN) form which can handle both quantitative (numerical) and qualitative (linguistic) knowledge. The learning algorithm of a FNN is composed of three phases. The first phase is used to find the initial membership functions of the fuzzy model. In the second phase, a new algorithm is developed and used to extract the linguistic-fuzzy rules. In the third phase, a multiresolutional dynamic genetic algorithm (MRD-GA) is proposed and used for optimized tuning of membership functions of the proposed model. Two well-known benchmarks are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed modeling approach, and compare it with other modeling approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/712150/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1998","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6024803","pubMedId":"18255764","volume":"9","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A genetic-based neuro-fuzzy approach for modeling and control of dynamical systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A genetic-based neuro-fuzzy approach for modeling and control of dynamical systems","sourcePdf":"00712150.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041054S","chronDate":"Sept.  1998","isNumber":"15435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"163","articleId":"712150","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":712151,"authors":[{"name":"P.

On the other hand, most connectionist models assume that data are organized according to relatively poor structures, like arrays or sequences. The framework described in this paper is an attempt to unify adaptive models like artificial neural nets and belief nets for the problem of processing structured information. In particular, relations between data variables are expressed by directed acyclic graphs, where both numerical and categorical values coexist. The general framework proposed in this paper can be regarded as an extension of both recurrent neural networks and hidden Markov models to the case of acyclic graphs. In particular we study the supervised learning problem as the problem of learning transductions from an input structured space to an output structured space, where transductions are assumed to admit a recursive hidden state-space representation. We introduce a graphical formalism for representing this class of adaptive transductions by means of recursive networks, i.e., cyclic graphs where nodes are labeled by variables and edges are labeled by generalized delay elements. This representation makes it possible to incorporate the symbolic and subsymbolic nature of data. Structures are processed by unfolding the recursive network into an acyclic graph called encoding network. In so doing, inference and learning algorithms can be easily inherited from the corresponding algorithms for artificial neural networks or probabilistic graphical model.","doi":"10.1109/72.712151","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/15435/00712151.pdf","startPage":"768","endPage":"786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.712151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15435","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A general framework for adaptive processing of data structures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=712151","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/712151/","displayDocTitle":"A general framework for adaptive processing of data structures","volume":"9","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","accessionNumber":"6024804","pubMedId":"18255765","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A general framework for adaptive processing of data structures","sourcePdf":"00712151.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063423S","chronDate":"Sept.  1998","isNumber":"15435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"248","articleId":"712151","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":712152,"authors":[{"name":"LiMin Fu","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"lastName":"LiMin Fu","id":"37087165157"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"712152","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=712152","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine learning","Neural networks","Data mining","Logic programming","Expert systems","Uncertainty","Learning systems","Computational complexity","Psychology","Artificial intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transfer functions","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","expert systems","computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural-network model","domain rule learning","activation function characteristics","machine learning","complex domain","CFNet","certainty factor","expert systems","computational complexity","rule learning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/72.712152","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/15435/00712152.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","startPage":"787","endPage":"795","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15435","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.712152","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural-network model for learning domain rules based on its activation function characteristics","abstract":"A challenging problem in machine learning is to discover the domain rules from a limited number of instances.

Therefore they can handle more general types of data in addition to N-dimensional vectors. The FLNN neural model stems from a cross-fertilization of lattice theory and fuzzy set theory. Hence a novel theoretical foundation is introduced in this paper, that is the framework of fuzzy lattices or FL-framework, based on the concepts fuzzy lattice and inclusion measure. Sufficient conditions for the existence of an inclusion measure in a mathematical lattice are shown. The performance of the two FLNN schemes, that is for clustering and for classification, compares quite well with other methods and it is demonstrated by examples on various data sets including several benchmark data sets.","doi":"10.1109/72.712161","startPage":"877","endPage":"890","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.712161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15435","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/15435/00712161.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy lattice neural network (FLNN): a hybrid model for learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/712161/","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy lattice neural network (FLNN): a hybrid model for learning","volume":"9","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6024812","pubMedId":"18255773","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy lattice neural network (FLNN): a hybrid model for learning","sourcePdf":"00712161.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035029S","chronDate":"Sept.  1998","isNumber":"15435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"76","articleId":"712161","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":712162,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The fault tolerance problem for a feedforward network is formulated as a constrained minimax optimization problem. Two different methods are used to solve it. In the first method, the constrained minimax optimization problem is converted to a sequence of unconstrained least-squares optimization problems, whose solutions converge to the solution of the original minimax problem. An efficient gradient-based minimization technique, specially tailored for nonlinear least-squares optimization, is then applied to perform the unconstrained minimization at each step of the sequence. Several modifications are made to the basic algorithm to improve its speed of convergence. In the second method a different approach is used to convert the problem to a single unconstrained minimization problem whose solution very nearly equals that of the original minimax problem. Networks synthesized using these methods, though not always fault tolerant, exhibit an acceptable degree of partial fault tolerance.","doi":"10.1109/72.712162","startPage":"891","endPage":"900","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/15435/00712162.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.712162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15435","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis of fault-tolerant feedforward neural networks using minimax optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network synthesis","Fault tolerance","Neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Minimax techniques","Biological neural networks","Backpropagation algorithms","Artificial neural networks","Constraint optimization","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","minimax techniques","least squares approximations","nonlinear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault-tolerant feedforward neural network synthesis","constrained minimax optimization problem","unconstrained least-squares optimization problem sequence","efficient gradient-based minimization technique","nonlinear least-squares optimization","convergence speed","unconstrained minimization problem","partial fault tolerance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/712162/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of fault-tolerant feedforward neural networks using minimax optimization","volume":"9","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6024813","pubMedId":"18255774","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of fault-tolerant feedforward neural networks using minimax optimization","sourcePdf":"00712162.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03062S","chronDate":"Sept.  1998","isNumber":"15435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"35","articleId":"712162","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-27"},{"_id":712163,"authors":[{"name":"Jui-Cheng Yen","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Lien Ho College of Technology and Commerce, Miaoli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jui-Cheng Yen","id":"37087163787"},{"name":"Jiun-In Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Lien Ho College of Technology and Commerce, Miaoli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jiun-In Guo","id":"37087145350"},{"name":"Hun-Chen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Lien Ho College of Technology and Commerce, Miaoli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hun-Chen Chen","id":"37087199827"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"712163","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=712163","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Convergence","Computer architecture","Hardware","Computational modeling","Artificial neural networks","Pattern recognition","Analog circuits","Neurons","Arithmetic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel architectures","neural net architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["winners-take-all neural network","array architecture","WINSTRON","competitive learning algorithm","coarse-fine competition","data distributions","hardware complexity","computing speed"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new neural-network model called WINSTRON and its novel array architecture are proposed.

First, we perform qualitative analysis establishing uniform boundedness of moments of the neuron states over time. To enable practical application, however, it is necessary to relate these properties to useful measures that can be estimated. We thus subsequently derive bias and variance measures for the noisy RNN with respect to the corresponding deterministic RNN. This has significant practical implications, since net design is nonminimal in the sense that several nets can solve the same problem. The results allow the user to evaluate given RNN for noise performance. The designer can use these results to constrain the design space so that the design satisfies performance specifications whenever possible. An example is provided using the measures derived in this paper to predetermine the best among several RNN designs for a given problem.","doi":"10.1109/72.712164","startPage":"913","endPage":"936","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.712164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15435","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/15435/00712164.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noisy recurrent neural networks: the continuous-time case","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/712164/","displayDocTitle":"Noisy recurrent neural networks: the continuous-time case","volume":"9","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6024815","pubMedId":"18255776","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noisy recurrent neural networks: the continuous-time case","sourcePdf":"00712164.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.249571S","chronDate":"Sept.  1998","isNumber":"15435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"17","articleId":"712164","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":712165,"authors":[{"name":"O.

The sampled-data nonlinear system is assumed to be controllable and its state vector is available for measurement. The variable structure control with a sector serves two purposes. One is to force the system state to be within the state region in which the NN's are used when the system goes out of neural control; and the other is to provide an additional control until the system tracking error metric is controlled inside the sector within the network approximation region. The proof of a complete stability and a tracking error convergence is given and the setting of the sector and the NN parameters is discussed. It is demonstrated that the asymptotic error of the system can be made dependent only on inherent network approximation errors and the frequency range of unmodeled dynamics. Simulation studies of a two-link manipulator show the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.","doi":"10.1109/72.712170","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/15435/00712170.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.712170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15435","startPage":"956","endPage":"968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stable neural-network-based adaptive control for sampled-data nonlinear systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=712170","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stable neural-network-based adaptive control for sampled-data nonlinear systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/712170/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","accessionNumber":"6031312","pubMedId":"18255779","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stable neural-network-based adaptive control for sampled-data nonlinear systems","sourcePdf":"00712170.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043287S","chronDate":"Sept.  1998","isNumber":"15435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"64","articleId":"712170","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":712173,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Passive learning refers to the normal situation in control applications in which the system inputs cannot be selected freely by the learning system.

Stability results are presented for both parametric (known model structure with unknown parameters) and nonparametric (unknown model structure resulting in /spl epsiv/-approximation error) adaptive control applications. Upper bounds on the tracking error are developed. The article also analyzes the persistence (PE) of excitation conditions required for parameter convergence. In addition, to a general PE analysis, the article presents a specific analysis pertinent to approximators that are composed of basis elements with local support. In particular, the analysis shows that as long as a reduced dimension subvector of the regressor vector is PE, then a specialized form of exponential convergence will be achieved. This condition is critical, since the general PE conditions are not practical in most control applications. In addition to the PE results, this article explicitly defines the regions over which the approximator converges when locally supported basis elements are used. The results are demonstrated throughout via examples.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability and approximator convergence in nonparametric nonlinear adaptive control","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/72.712182","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/15435/00712182.pdf","startPage":"1008","endPage":"1020","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.712182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15435","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=712182","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/712182/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Stability and approximator convergence in nonparametric nonlinear adaptive control","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","accessionNumber":"6024821","pubMedId":"18255784","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability and approximator convergence in nonparametric nonlinear adaptive control","sourcePdf":"00712182.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038915S","chronDate":"Sept.  1998","isNumber":"15435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"98","articleId":"712182","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":712183,"authors":[{"name":"T.

These thresholds, which depend on the distance between the input vector and the prototype, are calculated in a separate threshold calculating unit. The data are cycled through the network several times. At the end of each cycle the clusters are evaluated, and only those with more than a specified number of samples are retained. The others are fed back through the updated network. This process terminates according to a suitable criterion, such as when a prespecified portion of the data are classified. The performance of the CDL network has been compared with that of the winner-take-all (WTA) network for several different cluster structures, since the latter is widely used in cluster analysis applications. These studies demonstrate that the new network performs well for all the tested cluster shapes, also for those cases where the WTA network completely fails.","doi":"10.1109/72.712183","startPage":"1021","endPage":"1035","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.712183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15435","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/15435/00712183.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new neural network for cluster-detection-and-labeling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/712183/","displayDocTitle":"A new neural network for cluster-detection-and-labeling","volume":"9","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6031314","pubMedId":"18255785","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new neural network for cluster-detection-and-labeling","sourcePdf":"00712183.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0407S","chronDate":"Sept.  1998","isNumber":"15435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"43","articleId":"712183","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":712187,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofeng Liao","affiliation":["Department of Optoelectronic Technology, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Xiaofeng Liao","id":"37087191155"},{"name":"Jeubang Yu","affiliation":["Department of Optoelectronic Technology, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Jeubang Yu","id":"37087611754"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"712187","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":237,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":605},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=712187","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust stability","Hopfield neural networks","Delay effects","Neurons","Integrated circuit interconnections","Sufficient conditions","Delay estimation","Artificial neural networks","Neural networks","Magnesium compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hopfield neural nets","stability","delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust stability","time delay","network parameter deviation","network perturbations","interval dynamic Hopfield neural network","IDHNN model","unique equilibrium point"]}],"abstract":"The conventional Hopfield neural network with time delay is intervalized to consider the bounded effect of deviation of network parameters and perturbations yielding a novel interval dynamic Hopfield neural network (IDHNN) model.

The display utilizes electrostatic stimulation to generate a tactile sensation of texture on a scanning finger. The tactile sensation appeared to be a result of increased friction and vibration due to the electrostatic forces between the finger skin and the electrodes. Various spatial tactile patterns (lines, circles, squares, and triangles, etc.) can be presented on the display. Experiments of threshold, line separation, and pattern recognition were performed on subjects with visual impairments to study the spatial resolution and information transmission on arrays of variant electrode size and spacing. Two columns with two-column spacing can be resolved with 80% accuracy on the small array, for a spatial resolution of 5.8 mm in terms of edge-to-edge electrode distance. The overall percentages of correct recognition for the patterns were 68.3, 72.1, and 71.3% on the small, medium, and large arrays, respectively. While subject is an important factor for both threshold and pattern recognition, electrode size was statistically significant for threshold only.

It can be used by, e.g., patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) to develop a simple binary response in order to reply to specific questions. Four subjects participated in a series of on-line sessions with an EEG-based cursor control. The EEG was recorded from electrodes overlying sensory-motor areas during left and right motor imagery. The EEG signals were analyzed in subject-specific frequency bands and classified on-line by a neural network. The network output was used as a feedback signal. The on-line error (100%-perfect classification) was between 10.0 and 38.1%. In addition, the single-trial data were also analyzed off-line by using an adaptive autoregressive (AAR) model of order 6. With a linear discriminant analysis the estimated parameters for left and right motor imagery were separated. The error rate, obtained varied between 5.8 and 32.8% and was, on average, better than the on-line results. By using the AAR-model for on-line classification an improvement in the error rate can be expected, however, with a classification delay around 1 s.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15441","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel4/86/15441/00712230.pdf","doi":"10.1109/86.712230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/86.712230","startPage":"316","endPage":"325","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Separability of EEG signals recorded during right and left motor imagery using adaptive autoregressive parameters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/712230/","displayDocTitle":"Separability of EEG signals recorded during right and left motor imagery using adaptive autoregressive parameters","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"6025550","pubMedId":"9749909","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Separability of EEG signals recorded during right and left motor imagery using adaptive autoregressive parameters","sourcePdf":"00712230.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062376S","chronDate":"Sept.  1998","isNumber":"15441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"86","citationCount":"379","articleId":"712230","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":712236,"authors":[{"name":"R.D.

We describe the options for WDM access systems, and evaluate them on the basis of an international standard that is emerging for passive optical networks (PONs) that use wavelength-independent power splitting. The greatest impediment to meeting the high-bandwidth potential of WDM for downstream (i.e., from the central office to the home) transmission is the need for a moderately priced multiple-wavelength light source, implementing WDM in the upstream (home to central office) direction presents greater hurdles than in the downstream. The technical aspects of overcoming these hurdles can all be met. The real challenge will be in finding technical solutions that can meet the very stringent cost requirements of access systems. Systems that use WDM in the downstream direction only, while using wavelength-independent power-combining in a PON configuration for upstream, may prove economical before full WDM systems. WDM may also prove valuable if upgrades are needed in the future for power-splitting PON's.","doi":"10.1109/50.712236","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","startPage":"1546","endPage":"1559","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/50/15437/00712236.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.712236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15437","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An evaluation of architectures incorporating wavelength division multiplexing for broad-band fiber access","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelength division multiplexing","Passive optical networks","Optical fiber devices","Optical network units","Optical fibers","Optical fiber networks","Central office","Costs","Power generation economics","Optical fiber communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","optical fibre subscriber loops","wavelength division multiplexing","light sources","telecommunication standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelength division multiplexing","broad-band fiber access","WDM","high bit rates","access systems","residential customers","small business customers","WDM access systems","international standard","passive optical networks","wavelength-independent power splitting","high-bandwidth potential","central office to the home transmission","moderately priced multiple-wavelength light source","home to central office direction","technical solutions","wavelength-independent power-combining","PON configuration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","displayDocTitle":"An evaluation of architectures incorporating wavelength division multiplexing for broad-band fiber access","volume":"16","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6029350","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/712236/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An evaluation of architectures incorporating wavelength division multiplexing for broad-band fiber access","sourcePdf":"00712236.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076504S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"100","articleId":"712236","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":712237,"authors":[{"name":"B.

WDM-based optical networks employing passive-star couplers have been proposed for deployment in local and metropolitan areas. Optical amplification is often required in such networks to compensate for the signal attenuation along the fiber links and the splitting and coupling losses in the network. However, an optical amplifier has constraints on the maximum gain and the maximum output power it can supply; thus optical amplifier placement becomes a challenging problem. A simplifying assumption for analytical tractability requires that all wavelengths, present at a particular point in a fiber, be at the same power level, viz, the equally powered-wavelengths case. However, previous studies did not minimize the total number of amplifiers while achieving power equalization. In this paper, we formulate the minimization of amplifiers with power equalization as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) that can be solved by a linear program solver. Illustrative examples on sample networks are presented, which demonstrate the characteristics and the advantages of our optimal amplifier placement algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/50.712237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.712237","startPage":"1560","endPage":"1569","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/50/15437/00712237.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15437","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing amplifier placements in a multiwavelength optical LAN/MAN: the equally powered-wavelengths case","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing amplifier placements in a multiwavelength optical LAN/MAN: the equally powered-wavelengths case","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"16","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6029351","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/712237/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing amplifier placements in a multiwavelength optical LAN/MAN: the equally powered-wavelengths case","sourcePdf":"00712237.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036714S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"22","articleId":"712237","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":712238,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The mechanical antireflection switch (MARS) modulator offers a high-speed alternative for applications including dynamic gain control in fiber amplifiers. This paper describes a compact electrically controlled variable attenuator using a micromechanical device where electrostatic deflection of a silicon nitride quarter-wave dielectric layer suspended over a silicon substrate creates a variable reflectivity mirror. This device is packaged with two fibers in one ceramic ferrule placed in contact with a gradient index (GRIN) collimation lens, so that the input light reflects from the modulator in the collimated beam plane and couples into the output fiber. Using a 300 /spl mu/m diameter MARS attenuator and a 500 /spl mu/m diameter collimation lens, the total insertion loss at 1550 nm was 3.0 dB with no applied voltage, increasing to 31 dB at 35.2 V. The polarization dependent loss was less than 0.06 dB. Full attenuation with more than 100 mW input power produced no damage. The response time was 2.8 /spl mu/s to move from maximum to minimum transmission and 1.1 /spl mu/s to return to maximum transmission.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/712250/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6029364","volume":"16","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Micromechanical fiber-optic attenuator with 3 /spl mu/s response","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Micromechanical fiber-optic attenuator with 3 /spl mu/s response","sourcePdf":"00712250.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02672S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"72","articleId":"712250","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":712252,"authors":[{"name":"M.M.

DHN, a stochastic model is simple to implement and fast in computing but it uses binary value for states of neurons resulting in an approximate solution. On the other hand, CHN gives a near-optimal solution. However, it takes too much time to simulate a differential equation which provides a main characteristic of CHN. A matching problem using a graph matching technique can be cast into an optimization problem. A new method for two dimensional object recognition using a Hopfield neural network is proposed. A Hybrid Hopfield Network (HHN), which combines the merit of both the Continuous Hopfield Network and the Discrete Hopfield Network, is proposed and some of advantages such as reliability and speed are shown in this paper.

The system to be controlled is both unstable and nonlinear. The complete feedback control system is designed without detailed knowledge of the plant dynamics. During the first design step the plant is estimated using a feedforward neural net with linear feedthrough weights and linear output transfer functions. From the identified plant a linearized model is constructed around a suitable operating point, e.g. x = 0, in order to implement a linear optimal control law. The optimal state feedback controller is constructed to train the neurocontroller in the initial phase. Finally, using the partially trained controller, the neurocontroller is further trained \"on-line\" using a selected performance index to guide the learning. Simulation results indicate that the present design method is competitive with other methods and has the advantage that no specific model information is initially required.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimal control","Nonlinear systems","Neural networks","Control systems","Artificial neural networks","Nonlinear control systems","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Neurocontrollers","Feedback control","State feedback"]}],"previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00712372.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSST.1992.712372","startPage":"570","endPage":"573","publicationTitle":"The 24th Southeastern Symposium on System Theory and The 3rd Annual Symposium on Communications, Signal Processing Expert Systems, and ASIC VLSI Design","displayPublicationTitle":"The 24th Southeastern Symposium on System Theory and The 3rd Annual Symposium on Communications, Signal Processing Expert Systems, and ASIC VLSI Design","pdfPath":"/iel4/5598/14990/00712372.pdf","doi":"10.1109/SSST.1992.712372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Control of Nonlinear Systems Using Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Control of Nonlinear Systems Using Neural Networks","publicationDate":"1992","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 March 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/712372/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Mar 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Control of Nonlinear Systems Using Neural Networks","confLoc":"Greensboro, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"00712372.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032292S","chronDate":"1-3 Mar 1992","isNumber":"14990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5598","citationCount":"2","articleId":"712372","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":712379,"authors":[{"name":"R.D.

For example, the transmission bit-rate and the transmission distance product of optical fiber communication systems has progressed more than million times over the 20 years. There were many factors behind the progress. Strong demand for the increase of the transmission capacity in the world-wide scale has emerged with the expansion of internet and multi-media communications in recent 10 years. Technologies have responded quite well to this demand. Among them, opto-electronic devices based on InP material systems have been playing an important role as key components of long wavelength optical fiber communication systems. In this talk, the progress of the opto-electronic device technologies throughout recent 10 years will be reviewed from view points of applications to optical fiber communication systems. New directions of the optical communication systems, point-to-point transmission to photonic networks, and the related devices will also be discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recent progress and future prospect of optical communication systems using InP based opto-electronic devices","publicationTitle":"Conference Proceedings. 1998 International Conference on Indium Phosphide and Related Materials (Cat.

A high quality channel estimator with a low training overhead is the key to the successful delivery of DTV services which require high spectrum efficiency and robustness to strong and dynamic ghosts. Robustness to multipath distortion is especially important in a single frequency emission environment. This paper presents an application of a filtered decision feedback channel estimator for OFDM-based DTV systems using high order QAM modulations. The implementation and the performance of the channel estimator are discussed. Computer simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of the channel estimator. The channel estimation loss is about 1.2 dB from the ideal case where the channel is assumed to be known by the receiver. For a given multipath spread, the loss can be further reduced by increasing the FFT size. The FFT size is however subject to an upper limit imposed by the Doppler spread.","doi":"10.1109/11.713051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15452","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.713051","endPage":"11","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel4/11/15452/00713051.pdf","startPage":"2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Filtered decision feedback channel estimation for OFDM-based DTV terrestrial broadcasting system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/713051/","displayDocTitle":"Filtered decision feedback channel estimation for OFDM-based DTV terrestrial broadcasting system","volume":"44","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"5891761","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1998","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Filtered decision feedback channel estimation for OFDM-based DTV terrestrial broadcasting system","sourcePdf":"00713051.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100754S","chronDate":"Mar 1998","isNumber":"15452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"32","articleId":"713051","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":713052,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A FFT-based OFDM signal is subject to various hardware nonlinearities in both the transmitter and receiver. Hardware nonlinearities not only affect the in-band performance of an FFT-based OFDM system but also may affect the system performance of an adjacent channel signal because of regenerated sidelobes of the transmitted signal. The paper investigates the in-band and out-of-band behaviour of a 64QAM-OFDM system under various nonlinear devices. It is shown that the inherent signal clipping in the IFFT processors with a limited word length reduces the required RF amplifier output backoff (OBO) where adjacent channel interference is the limiting factor. For a 0.25% clipping rate, an additional 2 dB OBO is required for the COFDM signal to achieve the same level of adjacent channel interference as for the single carrier system. The loss in SNR due to signal clipping is negligible in a coded OFDM system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel4/11/15452/00713052.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"21","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","doi":"10.1109/11.713052","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.713052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15452","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=713052","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware nonlinearities in digital TV broadcasting using OFDM modulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Digital TV","TV broadcasting","OFDM","Interchannel interference","Fading","Transmitters","System performance","RF signals","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital television","television broadcasting","frequency division multiplexing","modulation coding","adjacent channel interference","quadrature amplitude modulation","multipath channels","fading","television receivers","television transmitters","fast Fourier transforms","inverse problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital TV broadcasting","OFDM modulation","hardware nonlinearities","coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multipath fading channels","FFT-based OFDM signal","transmitter","receiver","in-band performance","system performance","clipping rate","regenerated sidelobes","transmitted signal","out-of-band behaviour","64QAM-OFDM system","nonlinear devices","signal clipping","IFFT processors","word length","RF amplifier output backoff","adjacent channel interference","SNR"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/713052/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1998","displayDocTitle":"Hardware nonlinearities in digital TV broadcasting using OFDM modulation","volume":"44","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1998","accessionNumber":"5891762","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware nonlinearities in digital TV broadcasting using OFDM modulation","sourcePdf":"00713052.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050847S","chronDate":"Mar 1998","isNumber":"15452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"37","articleId":"713052","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":713053,"authors":[{"name":"R.L.

For the analysis of the received amplitude series, they were classified for each environment and elevation angle, into three different states according to the degree of shadowing experienced. This was done in order to develop a Markov chain based propagation simulator. The global (slow+fast) signal variations within each state are modelled using the Loo distribution (Rice+log-normal). Average distribution parameter values for each state, elevation angle and environment type are reported. The average state probabilities, slow variations' correlation lengths and other parameters are also presented.

In the case of digital transmission systems, the distortion of signals causes a degradation of bit error performance. It is an especially severe problem with digital outside-broadcasting-link (OBL) which has to transmit, for example, digital HDTV signals at more than about 45 Mbps. The OFDM modulation scheme can mitigate the adverse effects of multipath fading. An experimental OFDM modem has been developed to enable stable transmission of digital HDTV sources in an OBL. The experimental modem distributes transmitting digital data to 688 carriers in a bandwidth of about 13.5 MHz using the 16DAPSK for each OFDM carrier.

Additionally, a hierarchical transmission system based on a multi-resolution (MR) 64-QAM is described in Engels and Rohling which extends the service area of a TV programme in decoding a stepwise reduced data rate with increasing transmitter distance (graceful degradation). This procedure corresponds to a decreasing picture quality. In this paper MR concepts for the 64-DAPSK are developed.

I see ibid. vol.43, no.1, p.64-75, 1997. The effects of the high power amplifier (HPA) nonlinearities on the performance of the Eureka 147 DAB system are studied by computer simulation. The performance is determined for three types of HPA: a travelling wave tube amplifier (TWTA), a solid state power amplifier (SSPA) and a perfectly linearized amplifier (PLA). Two related performance criteria are used: (a) the degradation, resulting from HPA nonlinearities, in the E/sub b//N/sub 0/ ratio required at the receiver to maintain a bit error rate of 10/sup -4/ and (b) the total power degradation. These degradations are measured as a function of the HPA output backoff (OBO). The effect, on the E/sub b//N/sub 0/ degradation, of linearizing only the phase or only the amplitude transfer characteristic of the TWTA and the SSPA is also assessed. Correcting the phase distortion alone in both HPAs is found to reduce the E/sub b//N/sub 0/ degradation by less than 0.5 dB. Linearization of the amplitude characteristic alone, on the other hand, can reduce the E/sub b//N/sub 0/ degradation by several dBs at small OBO values (<2 dB). The optimum output backoff which minimizes the total power degradation is between 2 and 3 dB for both the TWTA and the SSPA in a terrestrial mobile channel and between 1 and 2 dB in an AWGN channel. The optimum output backoff for the PLA is 2 dB in the terrestrial channel and between 1 and 2 dB in the AWGN channel. At the optimal operation point, the power saved by linearizing the amplitude and phase characteristics of the TWTA or the SSPA is about 0.6 dB for the terrestrial mobile channel and 0.4 dB for the AWGN channel.","doi":"10.1109/11.713068","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel4/11/15453/00713068.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.713068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15453","startPage":"165","endPage":"171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of COFDM for digital audio broadcasting.

In such an environment, dynamic sectorization is introduced and a simple dynamic spreading code assignment scheme is proposed to assign codes for users in different areas.

The propagation environment is defined by its path loss coefficient and the traffic scenario as a two-dimensional Gaussian function which leads to a bell-shaped traffic distribution. The research is detailed for the case in which the peak of the two-dimensional Gaussian function is located at the same position of the central cell-site as that where the parameter F is obtained. For the other cell-sites the parameter is also obtained, but in a limited number of situations. This allows the use of a different efficiency factor for each cell of the system, instead of a constant value. The influence of the frequency reuse efficiency on the cell radius is also investigated for a particular case in which an analytical solution is derived. This analysis shows the strong impact of this factor on the cell area.","displayPublicationTitle":"ITS'98 Proceedings. SBT/IEEE International Telecommunications Symposium (Cat.

Two key algorithms are discussed: downconversion and low-resolution motion compensation. In the proposed scheme, incoming blocks are subject to a down-conversion process within the decoding loop, hence motion compensation is performed from the downconverted images. The filters used for down-conversion are based on the concept of frequency synthesis, and the filters used to perform the low-resolution motion compensation are determined by an optimal least squares solution. Using these algorithms, three different architectures that provide equal quality with varying system level complexity are presented; the first is directly derived from the initial model of the low-resolution decoder, another attempts to reduce the amount of computation for the IDCT, while another addresses the concerns regarding the amount of interface with an existing decoder structure. All of the above systems are hierarchical with regard to the logic used for filtering and scalable in the amount of memory which is required to reconstruct each output layer. Our simulation results demonstrate that high quality video can be provided at lower-resolutions with significant memory savings.","doi":"10.1109/30.713160","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel4/30/15451/00713160.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.713160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15451","startPage":"527","endPage":"536","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum drift architectures for 3-layer scalable DTV decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=713160","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Minimum drift architectures for 3-layer scalable DTV decoding","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/713160/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1998","accessionNumber":"6050552","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum drift architectures for 3-layer scalable DTV decoding","sourcePdf":"00713160.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058576S","chronDate":"Aug 1998","isNumber":"15451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"23","articleId":"713160","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":713172,"authors":[{"name":"Sung-Jea Ko","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sung-Jea Ko","id":"37289335200"},{"name":"Sung-Hee Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sung-Hee Lee","id":"37293421100"},{"name":"Kyung-Hoon Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kyung-Hoon Lee","id":"37351733400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0098-3063"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4127"}],"articleNumber":"713172","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":121,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":836},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ces/index.html"}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a new digital image stabilization (DIS) scheme based on bit-plane matching (BPM).

It provides optimal error performance but requires enormous computation for calculating the motion vector. In many fast algorithms, the three-step search (TSS) has been used for real time video encoding and low bit-rate video communications because of the reduced computations, simplicity and reasonable performance. Other modified algorithms of the TSS have been studied for the speed of computation and the error performance for motion estimation. This paper proposes a new algorithm (fast three-step search) for further reduction in computational complexity using a unimodal error surface assumption (UESA) without serious degradation of the error performance. We show that the computational complexity is further reduced with additional subsampling of the matching block. It is also shown that the proposed algorithm (FTSS) is computationally efficient while keeping the same performance as that of the TSS.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast three-step search algorithm with minimum checking points using unimodal error surface assumption","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/30.713175","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel4/30/15451/00713175.pdf","startPage":"638","endPage":"648","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.713175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15451","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=713175","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/713175/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1998","displayDocTitle":"A fast three-step search algorithm with minimum checking points using unimodal error surface assumption","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1998","accessionNumber":"6043912","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast three-step search algorithm with minimum checking points using unimodal error surface assumption","sourcePdf":"00713175.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05409S","chronDate":"Aug 1998","isNumber":"15451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"30","articleId":"713175","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":713176,"authors":[{"name":"Jeongnam Youn","affiliation":["Information Processing Laboratory Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Jeongnam Youn","id":"37373751500"},{"name":"Ming-Ting Sun","affiliation":["Information Processing Laboratory Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Ming-Ting Sun","id":"37278328800"},{"name":"Chia-Web Lin","affiliation":["Computer and Communication Research Laboratories, ITRI, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chia-Web Lin","id":"37366159300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0098-3063"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4127"}],"articleNumber":"713176","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":14,"totalDownloads":81},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ces/index.html"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Transcoding","Degradation","Motion analysis","Error analysis","Performance analysis","Quantization","Computational modeling","Analytical models","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding","data compression","motion estimation","computational complexity","quantisation (signal)","coding errors","adaptive systems","feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high performance transcoding","video bit-stream","quality degradation","frame-rate conversion","quantization errors","simulations","inaccurate motion vectors","video quality","adaptive motion vector refinement","reduced computational complexity","motion vector re-use","full-scale motion estimation"]}],"abstract":"Traditionally, the re-use of motion vectors extracted from incoming video bit-stream during transcoding has been widely accepted. However, this simple re-use scheme introduces significant quality degradation in many applications including the situation when the frame-rate conversion is needed. In this paper, we analyzed the quantization errors that cause the extracted motion vectors to be non-optimal and we performed simulations to show the quality degradation due to the inaccurate motion vectors during transcoding. To improve the video quality, we proposed an adaptive motion vector refinement. With a highly reduced computational complexity, the proposed adaptive motion vector refinement achieves significant quality improvement in comparison to the conventional motion vector re-use scheme. In addition, the adaptive motion vector refinement is almost as good as performing a new full-scale motion estimation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion estimation for high performance transcoding","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/30.713176","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel4/30/15451/00713176.pdf","startPage":"649","endPage":"658","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.713176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15451","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=713176","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/713176/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1998","displayDocTitle":"Motion estimation for high performance transcoding","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1998","accessionNumber":"6043913","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion estimation for high performance transcoding","sourcePdf":"00713176.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064412S","chronDate":"Aug 1998","isNumber":"15451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"34","articleId":"713176","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":713177,"authors":[{"name":"Hwang-Seok Oh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hwang-Seok Oh","id":"37276351400"},{"name":"Heung-Kyu Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Heung-Kyu Lee","id":"37280126000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0098-3063"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4127"}],"articleNumber":"713177","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":144},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ces/index.html"}],"abstract":"The motion estimation and compensation technique is widely used for video coding applications but it is hard to implement the real-time video codec due to its enormous computations.

To eliminate the throughput bottleneck, optical signal processing is used in the proposed switching network to guarantee a high processing speed which is required by incoherent optical CDMA. This in turn can support real-time broadband communication services. Because strict optical orthogonal codes (OOCs) are employed, both cross-correlation and autocorrelation constraints are strictly limited to be \"1\" for variable-bitrate (VBR) and constant-bit-rate (CBR) data communications. In the VBR case, the use of strict OOCs can guarantee a lower bit error rate than using conventional OOCs. Moreover, the proposed ATM switching network can efficiently support CBR and VBR communications (e.g. HDTV and video conferencing with the MPEG-2 standard), with no increase of system bandwidth and no change of optical CDMA encoder/decoder. Simple theory and code construction of strict OOCs are presented. Moreover, error correction codes are used in fiber-optic CDMA networks to improve the system performance.","doi":"10.1109/30.713219","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel4/30/15451/00713219.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.713219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15451","startPage":"952","endPage":"962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New fiber-optic ATM switching networks using optical code-division multiple access for broadband communication applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=713219","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New fiber-optic ATM switching networks using optical code-division multiple access for broadband communication applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/713219/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1998","accessionNumber":"6043949","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New fiber-optic ATM switching networks using optical code-division multiple access for broadband communication applications","sourcePdf":"00713219.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065213S","chronDate":"Aug 1998","isNumber":"15451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"4","articleId":"713219","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":713223,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Ling Liu","affiliation":["Computer and Communication Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chia-Ling Liu","id":"37066586300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0098-3063"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4127"}],"articleNumber":"713223","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":150,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1630},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ces/index.html"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","RF signals","Interchannel interference","Quadrature phase shift keying","Degradation","Radio frequency","Baseband","Arm","Demodulation","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadrature phase shift keying","frequency division multiplexing","quadrature amplitude modulation","signal detection","interference (signal)","crosstalk","error statistics","demodulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["I/Q imbalance","QPSK-OFDM-QAM detection","quadrature down-converter","performance","QPSK-OFDM-QAM system","phase imbalance","amplitude imbalance","inter-channel interference","crosstalk","quadrature channels","in-phase channels","bit error ratio","BER performance","QPSK sub-carriers","demodulator"]}],"abstract":"The impacts of the I/Q imbalance in the quadrature down-converter on the performance of a QPSK-OFDM-QAM system are studied.

Time synchronization consists of symbol timing recovery and sampling clock adjustment. In general, symbol timing recovery is carried out before sampling clock adjustment. The main problem with time synchronization errors is that the sample rob/stuff phenomenon due to sampling clock frequency offset leads to adding the symbol timing offset. Thus a more efficient synchronization algorithm is required. This paper introduces a new joint algorithm between symbol timing recovery and sampling clock adjustment using the difference of phase changes between the pilot carriers. The performance of the proposed algorithm is carried out under AWGN and multipath fading channel.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel4/30/15451/00713247.pdf","startPage":"1142","endPage":"1149","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/30.713247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.713247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15451","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=713247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new joint algorithm of symbol timing recovery and sampling clock adjustment for OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","Sampling methods","Clocks","Signal processing algorithms","Frequency synchronization","AWGN","OFDM modulation","Digital signal processing","Digital audio broadcasting","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiplexing","synchronisation","digital communication","Gaussian channels","multipath channels","fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint algorithm","symbol timing recovery","sampling clock adjustment","OFDM systems","time synchronization errors","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","digital communications","sample rob/stuff phenomenon","sampling clock frequency offset","symbol timing offset","pilot carriers","phase change difference","AWGN channel","multipath fading channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/713247/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1998","displayDocTitle":"A new joint algorithm of symbol timing recovery and sampling clock adjustment for OFDM systems","volume":"44","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1998","accessionNumber":"6043976","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new joint algorithm of symbol timing recovery and sampling clock adjustment for OFDM systems","sourcePdf":"00713247.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052773S","chronDate":"Aug 1998","isNumber":"15451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"63","articleId":"713247","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":713248,"authors":[{"name":"Min-Young Park","affiliation":["Digital Media Research Laboratory, LG Electronics, Inc., Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Min-Young Park","id":"37365308500"},{"name":"Weon-Cheol Lee","affiliation":["Digital Media Research Laboratory, LG Electronics, Inc., Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Weon-Cheol Lee","id":"37366209000"},{"name":"Jong-Ho Kwak","affiliation":["Digital Media Research Laboratory, LG Electronics, Inc., Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong-Ho Kwak","id":"37366654700"},{"name":"Choul-Hee Cho","affiliation":["Digital Media Research Laboratory, LG Electronics, Inc., Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Choul-Hee Cho","id":"37367812500"},{"name":"Hyung-Mo Park","affiliation":["Digital Media Research Laboratory, LG Electronics, Inc., Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hyung-Mo Park","id":"37365407000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0098-3063"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4127"}],"articleNumber":"713248","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":132},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ces/index.html"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Digital video broadcasting","Digital audio broadcasting","Transmitters","Modulation coding","Frequency estimation","Channel estimation","Equalizers","Laboratories","Frequency conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiplexing","digital television","television transmitters","fading","Rayleigh channels","Rician channels","quadrature amplitude modulation","multipath channels","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demapping method","COFDM system","transmitter","coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","standard transmission system","terrestrial digital TV","Europe","Rician fading channel","Rayleigh fading channel","performance","soft decision demapper","QAM","channel state information","multipath channel","Viterbi decoder"]}],"abstract":"This paper is concerned about the demapping method using the pilots inserted in transmitter in COFDM (coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) system which is the standard transmission system of terrestrial digital TV in Europe.

The floating point unit occupies a significant percentage of the silicon area in a microprocessor due its wide data bandwidth (for double precision computations) and the area occupied by the multiply array. For microprocessors designed for portable products, the design site of the floating point unit plays an important role in the low cost factor driven by reduced chip area. Some microprocessors have multiply-add fused floating point units with a reduced multiply array, requiring two passes through the array for operations involving double precision multiplies. The paper discusses the design complexities around the dual pass multiply array and its effect on area and performance. Floating point unit areas and their associated multiply array areas are compared for a single and dual pass implementation in a given technology (PowerPC 604eTM and PowerPC 603eTM microprocessors, respectively).","doi":"10.1109/12.713312","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel4/12/15456/00713312.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.713312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15456","startPage":"927","endPage":"937","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of single- and dual-pass multiply-add fused floating-point units","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=713312","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of single- and dual-pass multiply-add fused floating-point units","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/713312/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","accessionNumber":"6043549","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of single- and dual-pass multiply-add fused floating-point units","sourcePdf":"00713312.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058888S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15456","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"34","articleId":"713312","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":713316,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Complex reverse engineering tools can be built by analyzing information stored in the repository without reparsing the original source code. The most critical design aspect of a repository is its data model, which directly affects how effectively the repository supports various analysis tasks. This paper focuses on the design rationales behind a data model for a C++ software repository that supports reachability analysis and dead code detection at the declaration level. These two tasks are frequently needed in large software projects to help remove excess software baggage, select regression tests and support software reuse studies. The language complexity introduced by class inheritance, friendship, and template instantiation in C++ requires a carefully designed model to catch all necessary dependencies for correct reachability analysis. We examine the major design decisions and their consequences in our model and illustrate how future software repositories can be evaluated for completeness at a selected abstraction level. Examples are given to illustrate how our model also supports variants of reachability analysis: impact analysis, class visibility analysis, and dead code detection. Finally, we discuss the implementation and experience of our analysis tools on a few C++ software projects.","doi":"10.1109/32.713323","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","startPage":"682","endPage":"694","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel4/32/15463/00713323.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.713323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A C++ data model supporting reachability analysis and dead code detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reachability analysis","Relational databases","Reverse engineering","Data models","Information analysis","Software testing","Software maintenance","Software tools","Buildings","Tree graphs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object-oriented languages","object-oriented programming","C language","reachability analysis","software libraries","software reusability","systems re-engineering","reverse engineering","inheritance","data structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["C++","data model","reachability analysis","dead code detection","software repository","program understanding","system reengineering","software project","reverse engineering tools","large software projects","regression tests","software reuse","language complexity","class inheritance","friendship","template instantiation","impact analysis","class visibility analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","displayDocTitle":"A C++ data model supporting reachability analysis and dead code detection","volume":"24","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6057917","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/713323/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A C++ data model supporting reachability analysis and dead code detection","sourcePdf":"00713323.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063453S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"33","articleId":"713323","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":713326,"authors":[{"name":"D.S.

In this paper, we propose a revised definition to overcome shortcomings in interpreting optical flow merely as a geometric transformation field. The new definition is a complete representation of geometric and radiometric variations in dynamic imagery. We argue that this is more consistent with the common interpretation of optical flow induced by various scene events. This leads to a general framework for the investigation of problems in dynamic scene analysis, based on the integration and unified treatment of both geometric and radiometric cues in time-varying imagery. We discuss selected models, including the generalized dynamic image model, for the estimation of optical flow. We show how various 3D scene information are encoded in, and thus may be extracted from, the geometric and radiometric components of optical flow. We provide selected examples based on experiments with real images.","doi":"10.1109/34.713362","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel4/34/15461/00713362.pdf","startPage":"961","endPage":"979","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15461","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.713362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Revised definition of optical flow: integration of radiometric and geometric cues for dynamic scene analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/713362/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","displayDocTitle":"Revised definition of optical flow: integration of radiometric and geometric cues for dynamic scene analysis","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","accessionNumber":"6037190","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Revised definition of optical flow: integration of radiometric and geometric cues for dynamic scene analysis","sourcePdf":"00713362.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069294S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"179","articleId":"713362","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":713631,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

The method involves the modeling of an alternative relationship and the use of an a priori knowledge from which the unmeasured variable may be determined. To demonstrate this, a simulation model of a drying drum is considered, whose purpose is to increase the percentage of dry substance contained in pressed pulp. Among the process variables, the dry substance content of the pressed pulp at the inlet of the drum is assumed to be online immeasurable. A recurrent neural network is trained to predict the dry substance content of the pulp at the outlet of the drum, which is considered as a measurable output variable.

A class of recurrent networks called memory neuron networks are used for plant identification and control. These networks are obtained by adding trainable temporal elements to feedforward networks. This makes the network output history sensitive and gives them the capability to identify and control systems whose order is unknown or systems with unknown delay. A representative analytical model with higher harmonic pitch angles for minimizing hub shear forces is used for simulation. The effectiveness of the controller in minimizing the force level at varying and constant forward speed are studied.

Finding position and orientation of a mobile robot in a world coordinate system is a problem in localization. Dead-reckoning is commonly used for localization, but position and orientation errors from dead-reckoning tend to accumulate over time. The objective of the paper is to develop a feature-based localization method that uses the Hough transform to detect wall-like features in the environment based on sonar range data. Although the Hough transform is an effective method for detecting lines and curves from noisy data it has the drawback of being sensitive to discretization resolution. Results of line detection using various discretization resolutions and using a winner-take-all neural network are presented and discussed. The results indicate that the Hough transform method is able to reliably recognize wall-like features from noisy sonar data, but the accuracy of detected features is dependent heavily on the choice of resolution of parameter discretization.","doi":"10.1109/ISIC.1998.713694","startPage":"393","endPage":"400","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control (ISIC) held jointly with IEEE International Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics and Automation (CIRA) Intell","pdfPath":"/iel4/5771/15415/00713694.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control (ISIC) held jointly with IEEE International Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics and Automation (CIRA) Intell","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIC.1998.713694","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile robot localization using the Hough transform and neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile robots","Neural networks","Robot kinematics","Sonar detection","Global Positioning System","Computer vision","Navigation","Indoor environments","Target recognition","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hough transforms","mobile robots","sonar","neural nets","feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robot localization","Hough transform","autonomous mobile robot","feature-based localization method","wall-like features","sonar range data","line detection","winner-take-all neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/713694/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Sep 1998","displayDocTitle":"Mobile robot localization using the Hough transform and neural networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"17-17 Sept. 1998","accessionNumber":"6118550","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile robot localization using the Hough transform and neural networks","confLoc":"Gaithersburg, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00713694.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107983S","chronDate":"14-17 Sep 1998","isNumber":"15415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771","citationCount":"4","articleId":"713694","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":713697,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

Since it is difficult or impossible to obtain a single low-dimensional sufficient statistic, it is often necessary to utilize a sub-optimal yet still relatively high-dimensional feature set. The performance of such an approach is severely limited by the ability to estimate the PDF on a high-dimensional space from training data. A new theorem shows that by introducing a special \"noise-only\" signal class, it is possible to re-formulate the classical approach based upon M sufficient statistics, one corresponding to each signal class. Also, the optimal classifier requires knowledge of only the PDF's sufficient statistics under the corresponding signal class and under noise-only condition. We present simulation results of a 9-class synthetic problem showing dramatic improvements over the traditional high-dimensional approach.","doi":"10.1109/ISIC.1998.713697","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control (ISIC) held jointly with IEEE International Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics and Automation (CIRA) Intell","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control (ISIC) held jointly with IEEE International Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics and Automation (CIRA) Intell","pdfPath":"/iel4/5771/15415/00713697.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIC.1998.713697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15415","startPage":"413","endPage":"416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Class-specific feature sets in classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=713697","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Class-specific feature sets in classification","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Sep 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/713697/","conferenceDate":"17-17 Sept. 1998","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"6118553","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Class-specific feature sets in classification","confLoc":"Gaithersburg, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00713697.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027865S","chronDate":"14-17 Sep 1998","isNumber":"15415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771","citationCount":"8","articleId":"713697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":713699,"authors":[{"name":"R.W.

Such a method can be used, for example, to correct for motion artifacts due to patient movement or breathing during a CT scan. The basic component of the method is a model-based neural network, known as the maximum likelihood adaptive neural system (MLANS). Under the MLANS formulation, the object function is first modeled as a mixture of localized basis components, where each component is associated with parameters describing local object structure and dynamics of motion. MLANS then provides an iterative framework for optimizing the model parameters based on a measure of similarity between the model and the data. A bonus of the method is the flexibility to process incomplete data, where projections are available only over limited viewing angles. Results of computer simulations are presented to illustrate the algorithm performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Sep 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/713699/","accessionNumber":"6118555","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"17-17 Sept. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction of time-varying objects in computerized tomography using a model-based neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction of time-varying objects in computerized tomography using a model-based neural network","confLoc":"Gaithersburg, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00713699.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03064S","chronDate":"14-17 Sep 1998","isNumber":"15415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771","citationCount":"4","articleId":"713699","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":713701,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In the FLC-GA, fuzzy logic controllers dynamically schedule parameters of the object-level GA. A fuzzy knowledge-base is automatically identified and tuned using a high-level GA. In the TGA, a high-level GA is used to determine an optimal static parameter set for the object-level GA. The object-level GA supports a global evolutionary optimization of design, manufacturing, and supplier planning decisions for manufacturing of printed circuit assemblies in an agile environment. We demonstrate that high-level system identification or tuning performed with small object-level search spaces, can be extended to more elaborate object-level search spaces. The TGA performs superior searches, but incurs large search times. The FLC-GA performs faster searches than a TGA, and is slower than the GA that utilizes a canonical static parameter set. However, search quality of the FLC-GA is comparable to that of the GA which utilizes a canonical static parameter set.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Sep 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/713701/","accessionNumber":"6118557","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"17-17 Sept. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy logic controlled genetic algorithms versus tuned genetic algorithms: an agile manufacturing application","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy logic controlled genetic algorithms versus tuned genetic algorithms: an agile manufacturing application","confLoc":"Gaithersburg, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00713701.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052127S","chronDate":"14-17 Sep 1998","isNumber":"15415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5771","citationCount":"23","articleId":"713701","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":713766,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The neurons in one of the groups showed burst-like high frequency firing after the second or third electric stimulus. These burst-like activities were correlated with gill movement; the burst occurrence was found to accompany its enhancement.

The first layer outputs affine invariant patterns via winner-take-all competition between input cells whose weight vectors are equivalent to each other in a cluster. Responding to affine-different patterns, the first layer outputs different patterns when the weight vectors of the input cells in all clusters involve a sufficient number of linearly independent affine-different vectors. Thus, responding to the output patterns of the first layer, the second-layer is capable of affine invariant pattern recognition via winner-take-all competition between the input cells whose weight vectors are generated by the output patterns of the first layer responding to input patterns to be recognized. Similarly, the network with appropriate weight vectors has the ability of pattern recognition invariant to transformations in a subclass of affine transformations. The shift invariance via both the Fourier transform and neocognitron relates to the present network. The performance is examined by computer simulation.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1993.713888","startPage":"181","endPage":"184 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","pdfPath":"/iel4/5797/15487/00713888.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1993.713888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Competitive neural network for affine invariant pattern recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Pattern recognition","Fourier transforms","Computer simulation","Humans","Visual system","Control engineering","Vectors","Computer architecture","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","pattern recognition","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["competitive neural network","affine invariant pattern recognition","layered neural network","clusters","winner-take-all competition","weight vectors","shift invariance","Fourier transform","neocognitron"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/713888/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","displayDocTitle":"Competitive neural network for affine invariant pattern recognition","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","accessionNumber":"4985169","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Competitive neural network for affine invariant pattern recognition","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00713888.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025669S","chronDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","isNumber":"15487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5797","citationCount":"2","articleId":"713888","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":713908,"authors":[{"name":"J.K.

In a time delay neural network (TDNN), the shift-invariance capability required in speech recognition is achieved by explicitly making time-shifted copies of the inputs and internal responses and linking their corresponding weights. In this paper, we propose a limited feedback TDNN (LFB-TDNN), which feedbacks only those errors with significant magnitudes over a limited time span during the semi-batch back-propagation learning. Simulations show that the LFB-TDNN achieves favorable performance in isolated speech recognition tasks when compared with the standard TDNN, the discrete density and the continuous density hidden Markov models.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1993.713909","startPage":"271","endPage":"274 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1993.713909","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15487","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","pdfPath":"/iel4/5797/15487/00713909.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A limited feedback time-delay neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/713909/","displayDocTitle":"A limited feedback time-delay neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"4985190","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A limited feedback time-delay neural network","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00713909.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036474S","chronDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","isNumber":"15487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5797","citationCount":"2","articleId":"713909","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":713917,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The induced oscillation was characterized by limit cycles synthesized from at least two waveforms of oscillatory neurons. The estimated information capacity represented nearly equal amount of realization as in input's.

The neural network is designed to cooperate with a differentially phase shift keying (DPSK) demodulator, and a soft-decision quantizer which is an analog-to-digital convertor (ADC). The quantization thresholds in the quantizer are adaptively adjusted by the neural network according to the statistical characteristics of the analog symbol outputs of the DPSK demodulator. The channel cutoff rate R/sub 0/, created by the demodulation system (DPSK demodulator and quantizer), is employed to determine the best quantization threshold step-size /spl Delta//sub BEST/ that results in the minimization of the Viterbi decoder output bit error rate (BER). The neural network is trained to learn /spl Delta//sub BEST/ as a function of the mean and standard deviation of the analog symbol outputs of the DPSK demodulator. Consistent and substantial performance improvements, 3% to 30%, by computer simulations, have been demonstrated for various channel conditions. This neural network co-processor approach is easily generalized and applied to any digital signal processing system, and thus decrease the performance loss caused by quantization and/or signal instability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/713951/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4945572","conferenceDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","isConference":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive soft-decision quantizer for digital communications with convolutional coding on a Rayleigh fading channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive soft-decision quantizer for digital communications with convolutional coding on a Rayleigh fading channel","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00713951.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069346S","chronDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","isNumber":"15487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5797","citationCount":"2","articleId":"713951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":713952,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In this paper, we propose two formulations of offset function: the linearly decremental offset function that decrements offset value as iteration of the learning process increases, and the logarithmic error offset function that varies offset values according as logarithm of output errors. The performance of these methods are evaluated by recognition test of handwriting.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1993.713972","startPage":"540","endPage":"544 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","pdfPath":"/iel4/5797/15487/00713972.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1993.713972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Controlling the input/output function of the neural network by variable offset rule","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Education","Equations","Handwriting recognition","Testing","Character recognition","Information processing","Information systems","Laboratories","Stacking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","backpropagation","iterative methods","character recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["input/output function","variable offset rule","sigmoid function","backpropagation","neural networks","linearly decremental offset function","learning process iteration","logarithmic error","handwriting recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/713972/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","displayDocTitle":"Controlling the input/output function of the neural network by variable offset rule","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","accessionNumber":"4945592","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Controlling the input/output function of the neural network by variable offset rule","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00713972.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038628S","chronDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","isNumber":"15487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5797","citationCount":"2","articleId":"713972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":713984,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This paper also shows that the FNN can obtain portions of the fuzzy rules for the inferences of the static and dynamic degrees of danger and the decision table to avoid the moving obstacle.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1993.714004","startPage":"673","endPage":"676 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1993.714004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15487","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","pdfPath":"/iel4/5797/15487/00714004.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Knowledge acquisition for collision avoidance using fuzzy neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/714004/","displayDocTitle":"Knowledge acquisition for collision avoidance using fuzzy neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"4950820","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Knowledge acquisition for collision avoidance using fuzzy neural networks","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00714004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038332S","chronDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","isNumber":"15487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5797","articleId":"714004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":714011,"authors":[{"name":"T.

When robots performs some tasks, they work along with the motion plans. The plane should be effective. The proposed strategy applies a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the plans. To evaluate the planned motion, the strategy applies fuzzy logic as a fitness function. The fitness function is referred to as fuzzy critic. The fuzzy critic evaluates populations in the GA with respect to multiple factors. Depending on the goals of the tasks, human operators can easily transfer inference rules in the fuzzy critic because of the fuzzy logic. In this paper, the strategy determines a path for a mobile robot which moves from a starting point to a goal point while avoiding obstacles in a work space and picking up loads on the way. Simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1993.714027","startPage":"770","endPage":"773 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1993.714027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15487","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","pdfPath":"/iel4/5797/15487/00714027.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy critic for robotic motion planning by genetic algorithm in hierarchical intelligent control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/714027/","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy critic for robotic motion planning by genetic algorithm in hierarchical intelligent control","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"4945618","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy critic for robotic motion planning by genetic algorithm in hierarchical intelligent control","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00714027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034173S","chronDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","isNumber":"15487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5797","citationCount":"16","articleId":"714027","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":714030,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The HNN is composed of two neural networks, an acoustic feature extraction network using a backpropagation network (BPN) and a fault discrimination network using a Gaussian potential function network (GPFN). The BPN is composed of five layers and the number of the middle hidden units is smaller than the others. The target patterns for the output layer are the same as the input patterns. After the learning of the network, the middle hidden layer acquires the compressed input information. The input patterns of the GPFN are the output values of the middle hidden layer in the BPN. The task of the HNN is to discriminate four conditions of the valve under various experimental conditions. As a result, 93.6% discrimination accuracy is obtained in this experiment. This suggests that the proposed model is effective for the acoustic diagnosis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/714063/","accessionNumber":"4961924","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid neural networks for acoustic diagnosis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid neural networks for acoustic diagnosis","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00714063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048127S","chronDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","isNumber":"15487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5797","citationCount":"3","articleId":"714063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":714064,"authors":[{"name":"W.P.

In this paper the authors propose a different method for improving the recognition rate. After removing the nonuniform background trend superimposed on mammographic images, the authors calculate two selected features, the standard deviation and entropy of an image, representing the texture of the image. The two texture features are then used as input to the neural network. A set of 30 breast images consisting of 20 benign and 20 malignant tumor patterns are used for investigation. The result is achieved with 100% accuracy, an improvement of 25% over the authors' previous result. The performance of the proposed method is considered to be comparable to several-year experienced radiologists. This encouraging result indicates that this method may be useful for classification of benign and malignant tumors in mammograms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/714072/","accessionNumber":"4961933","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Classification of breast tumors in mammograms using a neural network: utilization of selected features","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of breast tumors in mammograms using a neural network: utilization of selected features","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00714072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064284S","chronDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","isNumber":"15487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5797","citationCount":"2","articleId":"714072","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":714073,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

However, calculations from several of such techniques indicate that estimates of development effort and cost differ considerably and hence may pose problems to software managers in committing resources and controlling costs.

That is, determining which inputs has the largest effect on the output of the system. In addition, causal inference under different input conditions was tested. This is done by applying the index on a subset of the input data. Typical problems like the decoder and parity are tested and discussed. Lastly it is used to analyze historical data for detection of exceptions or special input cases. In all three methods, the system being studied which is available only in the form of input-output pair data, is first modelled using a neural network.

The network is designed to identify the class of an unlabelled pattern using the Bayesian decision theory. Since the theory explicitly requires the information of pattern distributions, the network has the capability of learning probability density functions (pdfs) of classes. To estimate pdfs, we adopt parametric estimation with Gaussian mixture model: a class is assumed to be composed of a number of subclasses, each of whose patterns has a Gaussian distribution. The BAYESNET learning includes two subprocesses, the initialization process and the main learning process. In the initialization process, the number of subclasses for each class by automatic generation and elimination of subclasses. Generation occurs when samples assigned to a subclass turns out to have an unexpected distribution, checked by the Chi-square test. A subclass is eliminated when the subclass contributes negligibly to forming the class pdf. The role of the main learning process is to fine-tune parameters of classes and subclasses. Though the learning is based on the winner-take-all scheme, one of the novelties of BAYESNET lies in the undeterministic winner selection. Unlike the usual nearest-neighbor selection, our network selects the winner according to the probability obtained by the current estimation. Due to the selection rule, the final parameter values are assured to agree with the maximum likelihood estimation. Besides, biases are added to the winner selection in order to help avoiding local minima states.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/714230/","accessionNumber":"4956716","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Self-organization of Gaussian mixture model for learning class pdfs in pattern classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-organization of Gaussian mixture model for learning class pdfs in pattern classification","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00714230.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058441S","chronDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","isNumber":"15470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5797","citationCount":"5","articleId":"714230","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":714232,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Two series of computer simulations are presented: one for the investigation of the basic characteristic of this function and the other one for the application of our method to a simple pattern classification task.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/714285/","accessionNumber":"4956764","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A method of analyzing information represented in neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method of analyzing information represented in neural networks","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00714285.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031329S","chronDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","isNumber":"15470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5797","citationCount":"5","articleId":"714285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":714290,"authors":[{"name":"Fu-Lai Chung","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Fu-Lai Chung","id":"37086987322"},{"name":"Tong Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Tong Lee","id":"37087142299"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1421-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"714290","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vector quantization","Neurons","Speech recognition","Fuzzy neural networks","Neural networks","Hidden Markov models","Fuzzy systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","vector quantisation","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["supervised competitive learning network","fuzzy learning vector quantization","fuzzy objective function","output error minimisation","training patterns","pattern classification","vowel recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=714290","abstract":"In this paper, a new supervised competitive learning network model called fuzzy learning vector quantization (FLVQ) which incorporates fuzzy concepts into the learning vector quantization (LVQ) networks is proposed. Unlike the original algorithm, the FLVQ's learning algorithm is derived from optimizing an appropriate fuzzy objective function which takes into accounts of two goals, namely, minimizing the network output error which is the class membership differences of target and actual values and minimizing the distances between training patterns and competing neurons. As compared with the LVQ network, the proposed one consists of several distinctive features: 1) stand-alone operation; 2) superior classification performance; and 3) avoiding neuron underutilization. These advantages are demonstrated through an artificially generated data set and a vowel recognition data set.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1993.714290","pdfPath":"/iel4/5797/15470/00714290.pdf","startPage":"2739","endPage":"2743 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1993.714290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy learning vector quantization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/714290/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy learning vector quantization","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4956769","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy learning vector quantization","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00714290.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050186S","chronDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","isNumber":"15470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5797","citationCount":"5","articleId":"714290","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":714292,"authors":[{"name":"S.

They have to be intelligent to determine their own actions in unknown environments by themselves based on sensory information. In advance, human operators can give the robots knowledge and skill in top-down manner, but when the robots perform tasks in unknown environment, the knowledge may not be useful, In this case, the robots have to adapt to their environments and acquire new knowledge by themselves through learning. This process proceeds in bottom-up manner. This paper introduces a control scheme for autonomous robots, hierarchical intelligent control. It consists of three levels: adaptation level, skill level and learning level. To link the three levels, the scheme uses artificial intelligence (AI), fuzzy logic, neural networks (NN) and genetic algorithm (GA). Each technique has advantages and disadvantages. In order to overcome the disadvantages, this paper introduces synthesis techniques of them. Those are key techniques for intelligent control of robots. This paper describes advantages and disadvantages of each technique, and explains how to construct the hierarchical intelligent control.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/714321/","accessionNumber":"4962399","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of fuzzy, artificial intelligence, neural networks, and genetic algorithm for hierarchical intelligent control-top-down and bottom-up hybrid method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of fuzzy, artificial intelligence, neural networks, and genetic algorithm for hierarchical intelligent control-top-down and bottom-up hybrid method","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00714321.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036825S","chronDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","isNumber":"15470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5797","citationCount":"2","articleId":"714321","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":714335,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

Experiments demonstrate that FGAs can search faster and more effectively than standard genetic algorithms in solving the traveling salesman and other optimization problems.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1993.714345","startPage":"2967","endPage":"2970 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","pdfPath":"/iel4/5797/15470/00714345.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1993.714345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fuzzy genetic algorithm with effective search and optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Hybrid intelligent systems","Traveling salesman problems","Size control","Biological cells","Fuzzy systems","Learning systems","Robots","Neural networks","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","search problems","expert systems","fuzzy neural nets","computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy genetic algorithm","search problems","optimization","fuzzy expert systems","genetic algorithms","traveling salesman problem","neural nets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/714345/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","displayDocTitle":"A fuzzy genetic algorithm with effective search and optimization","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","accessionNumber":"4962423","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fuzzy genetic algorithm with effective search and optimization","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00714345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024645S","chronDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","isNumber":"15470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5797","citationCount":"12","articleId":"714345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":714355,"authors":[{"name":"K.

A learning algorithm is required to be implemented on a VLSI chip because off-chip learning with a digital computer consumes too much time to be applied to many practical problems. The main obstacle to implement a learning algorithm is the complexity of the proposed algorithms. Algorithms like backpropagation include complex multiplication, summation and derivatives, which are very difficult to implement with VLSI circuits. The authors propose a new learning algorithm, which is suitable for analog implementation and implement it on a 2.2 mm/spl times/2.2 mm neural network chip with 100 weights, using the standard 2.0 /spl mu/m MOSIS process. The chips have successfully learned the XOR Gate problem.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1993.714359","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","pdfPath":"/iel4/5797/15470/00714359.pdf","startPage":"3031","endPage":"3034 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1993.714359","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analog neural network chip with random weight change learning algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=714359","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/714359/","displayDocTitle":"An analog neural network chip with random weight change learning algorithm","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4962437","conferenceDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analog neural network chip with random weight change learning algorithm","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00714359.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026904S","chronDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","isNumber":"15470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5797","citationCount":"27","articleId":"714359","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":714360,"authors":[{"name":"Chin Park","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Chin Park","id":"37087908071"},{"name":"K.

Multiple-layer neural network can be made by combining two or more-chips. Signals within the network (e.g., activations, error signals, connection weights) are represented by stochastic digital pulse trains. Both feed forward and learning processes are efficiently implemented with simple logical gates. Our novel approach for approximating the derivative of activation function is described. The approximation circuit requires only a few gates. Multiple-RNG architecture is adopted to ensure the random distribution of pulses. Both seeds and configurations of the random number generators on the chip can be updated dynamically and randomly by this mechanism. The effectiveness of the derivative and the Multiple-RNG architecture are simulated and verified with the learning performance in a hand-written character recognition problem. The chip can perform 5.12 gigapulse operations per second.

This process consists of two major activities, \"design\" and \"elaborate\". Through the design activity, the structure of software modules based on an object oriented model is interactively extracted from the informal English description. Each word such as nouns and verbs in the natural-language sentences is associated with a software concept, e.g. class, attribute, and method. Especially we concentrate on types of verb patterns occurring in the sentences to increase applicability to dynamic systems. The elaborate activity is one to refine and rewrite the informal specification more precisely based on the derived mod- ule design document.

The method is the evolution of an iterative procedure already set up by the authors and allows the most relevant disturbances in electrical power systems to be detected, localized and estimated automatically. The detection of the disturbance and its duration are attained by a proper application, on the sampled signal, of the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Disturbance amplitude is estimated by decomposing, in an optimized way, the signal in frequency subbands by means of the discrete time wavelet transform (DTWT). The proposed method is characterized by high rejection to noise, introduced by both measurement chain and system under test, and it is designed for an agile disturbance classification. Moreover, it is also conceived for future implementation both in a real-time measurement equipment and in an off-line analysis tool. In the paper firstly the theoretical background is reported and briefly discussed. Then, the proposed method is described in detail. Finally, some case-studies are examined in order to highlight the performance of the method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel4/61/15502/00714415.pdf","startPage":"990","endPage":"998","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/61.714415","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.714415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15502","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=714415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A measurement method based on the wavelet transform for power quality analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power measurement","Wavelet transforms","Continuous wavelet transforms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Power system analysis computing","Power system measurements","Frequency estimation","Electric variables measurement","Power quality","Iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power supply quality","power system measurement","wavelet transforms","electrical faults","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["measurement method","wavelet transform","power quality analysis","electrical power systems","iterative procedure","power system disturbances","power system disturbances localisation","sampled signal","continuous wavelet transform","disturbance amplitude estimation","high noise rejection","disturbance classification","real-time measurement equipment","off-line analysis tool","multiresolution signal decomposition","multiresolution signal reconstruction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/714415/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","displayDocTitle":"A measurement method based on the wavelet transform for power quality analysis","volume":"13","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6058774","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A measurement method based on the wavelet transform for power quality analysis","sourcePdf":"00714415.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055312S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"211","articleId":"714415","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":714426,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

It would be desirable to develop a high speed and accurate approach to determine the fault direction for different power system conditions. To classify forward and backward faults on a given line, a neural network's abilities in pattern recognition and classification could be considered as a solution. To demonstrate the applicability of this solution, neural network technique is employed and a novel Elman recurrent network is designed and trained. Details of the design procedure and the results of performance studies with the proposed network are given and analysed in the paper. System simulation studies show that the proposed approach is able to detect the direction of a fault on a transmission line rapidly and correctly.

Computer simulation results are shown in this paper and they indicate this approach can be used as an effective tool for high speed digital relaying, as the correct detection is achieved in less than 10 ms.","doi":"10.1109/61.714467","startPage":"1093","endPage":"1104","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.714467","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15502","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel4/61/15502/00714467.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy-neuro approach to fault classification for transmission line protection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/714467/","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy-neuro approach to fault classification for transmission line protection","volume":"13","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6058789","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy-neuro approach to fault classification for transmission line protection","sourcePdf":"00714467.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039774S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"125","articleId":"714467","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":714484,"authors":[{"name":"S.K.

However, detection of such a type of fault is very important to avoid any catastrophic situation. In this paper, the authors propose a new and powerful method capable of detecting minor incipient faults. The approach is based on wavelet transform analysis, particularly the dyadic-orthonormal wavelet transform. The key idea underlying the approach is to decompose a given faulty neutral current response into other signals which represent a smoothed and detailed version of the original. The decomposition is performed by the multiresolution signal decomposition technique. Preliminary simulation work demonstrated here shows that the proposed method is robust and far superior to other existing methods to resolve such types of faults.","doi":"10.1109/61.714484","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel4/61/15502/00714484.pdf","startPage":"1194","endPage":"1200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.714484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiresolution signal decomposition: a new tool for fault detection in power transformers during impulse tests","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=714484","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/714484/","displayDocTitle":"Multiresolution signal decomposition: a new tool for fault detection in power transformers during impulse tests","volume":"13","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6058802","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiresolution signal decomposition: a new tool for fault detection in power transformers during impulse tests","sourcePdf":"00714484.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023891S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"70","articleId":"714484","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":714487,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The control concept is based on a linearization of the dq inverter model. Feedforward techniques which are traditionally used for the approximate decoupling of d and q-axis control are discarded, in favour of a high gain full state feedback approach which assigns both closed loop system poles and, more importantly, their associated eigenvectors. Experimental validation of the approach is carried out on a laboratory STATCOM setup. Due to the nonlinear nature of the VSI equations and the uncertainty of AC system parameters, actual closed loop system dynamics can stray quite dramatically from those desired. Root locus analysis is therefore performed to investigate the small signal system dynamic behaviour. The loci demonstrate that the effect of system nonlinearity on the closed loop poles is virtually eliminated by the proposed control. The effect of AC system parameter variations is also shown to be minimal.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15502","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel4/61/15502/00714511.pdf","doi":"10.1109/61.714511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.714511","startPage":"1378","endPage":"1384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental evaluation of STATCOM closed loop dynamics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/714511/","displayDocTitle":"Experimental evaluation of STATCOM closed loop dynamics","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"6058829","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental evaluation of STATCOM closed loop dynamics","sourcePdf":"00714511.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086077S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"93","articleId":"714511","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":714549,"authors":[{"name":"C.R.

Such data transport mechanisms must satisfy a number of requirements - deadlock and livelock freedom, good hot-spot performance, high throughput and low latency. This paper proposes a solution to these problems, which allows deadlock free, adaptive, high throughput packet routing to be implemented on networks of processors. Examples are given which illustrate the technique for 2-D array and toroidal networks. An implementation of this scheme on arrays of transputers is described. The scheme also serves as a basis for a very low latency routing strategy named the mad postman, a detailed implementation of which is described here as well.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Performance Communications In Processor Networks","publicationTitle":"The 16th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","doi":"10.1109/ISCA.1989.714549","displayPublicationTitle":"The 16th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel4/5803/15479/00714549.pdf","startPage":"150","endPage":"157","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00714549.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCA.1989.714549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15479","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=714549","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/714549/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28 May-1 Jun 1989","displayDocTitle":"High Performance Communications In Processor Networks","conferenceDate":"28 May-1 June 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Performance Communications In Processor Networks","confLoc":"Jerusalem, Israel","sourcePdf":"00714549.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030201S","chronDate":"28 May-1 Jun 1989","isNumber":"15479","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5803","citationCount":"50","articleId":"714549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":714563,"authors":[{"name":"N.P.

In this paper we study a stor- age strategy for vector processors that has the following properties: (1) it is aperiodic, (2) it tends to distribute references more uniformly over the memory banks, (3) the implementation of the addressing hardware is straightforward, and (4) the delay added to the memory path is minimal.

W-CDMA is designed to flexibly offer wideband services which cannot be provided by present cellular systems, with various data rates as high as 2 Mb/s. The important concept of W-CDMA is the introduction of intercell asynchronous operation and the pilot channel associated with individual data channels. Intercell asynchronous operation facilitates continuous system deployment from outdoors to indoors. Other technical features of W-CDMA include fast cell search under intercell asynchronous operation, fast transmit power control, coherent spreading code tracking, a coherent RAKE receiver, orthogonal multispreading factor forward link, and variable-rate transmission with blind rate detection. The introduction of the data-channel-associated pilot channel allows W-CDMA to support interference cancellation and adaptive antenna array techniques that can significantly increase the link capacity and coverage.

Field experiment radio link performance results are also presented.","doi":"10.1109/35.714618","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/15499/00714618.pdf","startPage":"56","endPage":"69","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.714618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband DS-CDMA for next-generation mobile communications systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/714618/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Wideband DS-CDMA for next-generation mobile communications systems","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6030112","volume":"36","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband DS-CDMA for next-generation mobile communications systems","sourcePdf":"00714618.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042799S","chronDate":"Sept.  1998","isNumber":"15499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"543","articleId":"714618","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":714620,"authors":[{"name":"E.

UTRA will be connected to an evolved GSM core network for both circuit and packet services. A merger between ETSI/Europe and ARIB/Japan based on W-CDMA, a GSM core network, and a common frequency allocation according to the ITU Recommendation of 2 GHz makes a global IMT-2000 standard feasible. UTRA based on W-CDMA fully supports the UMTS/IMT-2000 requirements (e.g., support of 384 kb/s for wide-area coverage and 2 Mb/s for local coverage). Furthermore, the air interface has flexible support of mixed services, variable-rate services, and an efficient packet mode. Key W-CDMA features also include improved basic capacity/coverage performance compared to second-generation systems, full support of adaptive antenna arrays, support of hierarchical cell structures with interfrequency handover, and support of asynchronous inter-base-station operation. There have been no constraints due to the strong requirements for backward compatibility with second-generation systems. This has facilitated a high degree of flexibility and a future-proof air interface. Extensive evaluations by means of simulations and field trials have been carried out by a number of companies, and full system tests are ongoing. Consequently, W-CDMA technology can now be regarded as a mature technology, ready to provide the basis for UMTS/IMT-2000.","doi":"10.1109/35.714620","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/15499/00714620.pdf","startPage":"70","endPage":"80","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.714620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UMTS/IMT-2000 based on wideband CDMA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/714620/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1998","displayDocTitle":"UMTS/IMT-2000 based on wideband CDMA","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6030113","volume":"36","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UMTS/IMT-2000 based on wideband CDMA","sourcePdf":"00714620.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089293S","chronDate":"Sept.  1998","isNumber":"15499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"350","articleId":"714620","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":714623,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The first voltage source inverter, known as a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM), injects an almost sinusoidal current, of variable magnitude, at the point of connection. The second voltage source inverter, known as a static synchronous series compensator (SSSC) injects an almost sinusoidal voltage, of variable magnitude, in series with the transmission line. This injected voltage can be at any angle with respect to the line current. The exchanged real power at the terminals of one inverter with the line flows to the terminals of the other inverter through the common DC link capacitor. In addition, each inverter can exchange reactive power at its terminals independently.

We present a block sequential least squares decision feedback equalization algorithm with application to over-the-air HDTV channels. The proposed adaptive algorithm is derived on the basis of minimization of the least squares criterion, thereby achieving faster convergent and tracking rate relative to the recommended LMS algorithm. Meanwhile, good numerical stability is guaranteed because it successfully eliminates time updates of the filtering coefficients, which is the main cause of instability of FTF-like algorithms. Also of great significance is its drastic reduction in computational complexity by means of block operation, taking advantage of the slowly time-varying nature of terrestrial broadcasting channels. Simulation results show that the equalizer achieves an almost 3.5 dB SNR improvement at a bit error rate of 3/spl times/10/sup -6/ without significant increase in computational complexity, as compared to the conventional LMS decision feedback equalizer (DFE) when applied to the equalization of over-the-air HDTV channels.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Least squares methods","Decision feedback equalizers","HDTV","Least squares approximation","Computational complexity","Hardware","Adaptive algorithm","Minimization methods","Numerical stability","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high definition television","numerical stability","convergence of numerical methods","least squares approximations","adaptive equalisers","decision feedback equalisers","computational complexity","television broadcasting","time-varying channels","error statistics","multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block sequential least squares","decision feedback equalization algorithm","terrestrial HDTV transmission","high symbol rate","low hardware complexity","performance","commercial applications","adaptive algorithm","least squares criterion minimization","convergence rate","tracking rate","LMS algorithm","numerical stability","computational complexity reduction","time-varying channels","simulation results","SNR","bit error rate","over-the-air HDTV channels","multipath channels"]}],"doi":"10.1109/11.715313","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel4/11/15491/00715313.pdf","startPage":"278","endPage":"285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.715313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block sequential least squares decision feedback equalization algorithm with application to terrestrial HDTV transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=715313","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Block sequential least squares decision feedback equalization algorithm with application to terrestrial HDTV transmission","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/715313/","volume":"44","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6023540","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block sequential least squares decision feedback equalization algorithm with application to terrestrial HDTV transmission","sourcePdf":"00715313.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038124S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"1","articleId":"715313","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":715321,"authors":[{"name":"Ying-Dar Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ying-Dar Lin","id":"37087150704"},{"name":"Chun-Mo Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chun-Mo Liu","id":"37087437341"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9316"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9611"}],"articleNumber":"715321","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":59},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Broadcast Technology Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/bt/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=715321","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scheduling algorithm","Multiplexing","Intelligent networks","Bit rate","Streaming media","Transform coding","Video compression","Smoothing methods","Bandwidth","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cable television","scheduling","multiplexing","buffer storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["timestamp-sensitive scheduling algorithm","MPEG-2 multiplexers","CATV networks","smooth display","residential cable TV","deadline-driven scheduler","counter","transport stream packets","scheduling cycle","decoding timestamp","TS packets","deadline violation","timestamp-insensitive algorithm","constant-bit-rate scheduling","trace-driven simulation","timestamp-sensitive scheduling","burstiness","buffer underflow","buffer overflow","set-top-boxes"]}],"abstract":"To achieve smooth display of MPEG-II programs in the residential cable TV networks, we present a timestamp-sensitive scheduling algorithm for MPEG-II multiplexers.

The decoding timestamp (DTS) of TS packets is used to update the counter in order to prevent deadline violation. This algorithm is compared numerically with the timestamp-insensitive algorithm which runs constant-bit-rate (CBR) scheduling. The trace-driven simulation shows that the deadline violation of our timestamp-sensitive scheduling is much lower than CBR's and well controlled for programs with various degrees of burstiness.

This article describes a new method to calculate the composite second order (CSO) and composite triple beat (CTB) intermodulation distortion spectrum for the full frequency range of a coaxial cable CATV amplifier for any input frequency plan. The calculation takes into account the output level ripple and preemphasis, using frequency dependent intermodulation coefficients. These coefficients have been established through CSO/CTB measurements on multichannel test systems for standard frequency plans at 5-8 intermodulation frequencies or on distortion arrays for the two (three) oscillator measuring test system. The defined intermodulation coefficients are unrelated to the frequency plan and the input/output level ripple. It is also possible to calculate the CSO/CTB spectrum caused by analogue channels within digital QAM channels. The results equally apply to optical CATV receivers. Simulation results have been verified using extensive data from multichannel measurement systems.","doi":"10.1109/11.715324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.715324","startPage":"363","endPage":"370","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel4/11/15491/00715324.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Calculating the CSO/CTB spectrum of CATV amplifiers and optical receivers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","displayDocTitle":"Calculating the CSO/CTB spectrum of CATV amplifiers and optical receivers","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"44","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6030019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/715324/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calculating the CSO/CTB spectrum of CATV amplifiers and optical receivers","sourcePdf":"00715324.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021287S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"7","articleId":"715324","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":715325,"authors":[{"name":"Maw-Yang Liu","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Maw-Yang Liu","id":"37534371700"},{"name":"Hen-Wai Tsao","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hen-Wai Tsao","id":"37277278800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9316"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9611"}],"articleNumber":"715325","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Broadcast Technology Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/bt/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital multimedia broadcasting","Multimedia communication","Code division multiplexing","Optical receivers","Multiaccess communication","Optical noise","Bit rate","Correlators","Signal to noise ratio","Optical fiber networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","multimedia communication","broadcasting","optical fibre networks","optical signal detection","encoding","real-time systems","sequences","optical receivers","maximum likelihood detection","thermal noise","avalanche photodiodes","semiconductor device noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time multimedia broadcasting","direct-detection fiber-optic synchronous networks","coding architecture","M-ary CDMA network","variable bit rate","VBR transmission","constant bit rate","CBR transport","isochronous transport","bit-stuffed unipolar m-sequence","maximum a posteriori receiver","MAP receiver","system performance","simultaneous access broadcasting hosts","received laser power","input bit rate","thermal noise","APD noise","photodetection process","aggregate capacity","10.2 Gbit/s"]}],"abstract":"A new coding architecture for M-ary fiber-optic synchronous code division multiple access (CDMA) network is proposed to provide real-time multimedia broadcasting. In contrast with variable bit rate (VBR) transmission, the constant bit rate (CBR; i.e. isochronous) transport is more preferable in view of the networking simplicity. We apply a bit-stuffed unipolar m-sequence and maximum a posteriori (MAP) receiver in the proposed network. The system performance is determined by the following parameters: (1) number of simultaneous access broadcasting hosts K, (2) received laser power, (3) input bit rate, and (4) the dimension of M. Furthermore, the adverse impact (thermal noise, APD noise) in the photodetection process is carefully analyzed. Numerical results reveals that for the binary case, the aggregate capacity can achieve 10.2 Gbps.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time multimedia broadcasting via direct-detection fiber-optic synchronous CDMA networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","doi":"10.1109/11.715325","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel4/11/15491/00715325.pdf","startPage":"371","endPage":"380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.715325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15491","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=715325","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/715325/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","displayDocTitle":"Real-time multimedia broadcasting via direct-detection fiber-optic synchronous CDMA networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","accessionNumber":"6023548","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time multimedia broadcasting via direct-detection fiber-optic synchronous CDMA networks","sourcePdf":"00715325.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056997S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"1","articleId":"715325","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":715412,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A deteriorated winding has a PD activity which can be 30 times or more higher than a winding in good condition. This great difference in PD activity enables even nonspecialized maintenance personnel to identify the few motors or generators in a company which need further investigation and/or maintenance. There are several advantages to on-line partial discharge tests. Machines in good condition require less attention. The overall effect is lower maintenance costs. After implementing on-line partial discharge tests, as well as other monitoring such as flux probing or current harmonic analysis and improved temperature sensing, companies can often confidently extend the outage between major machine inspections. This saves on outage costs and reduces the risk of a stator fault due to human error during maintenance. Finally, on older machines, if there has been no increase in partial discharge activity over time, then the life of the stator winding can be confidently extended, saving a considerable capital expenditure.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/715501/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6035814","volume":"4","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Stator winding monitoring","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stator winding monitoring","sourcePdf":"00715501.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026432S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1998","isNumber":"15469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2943","citationCount":"69","articleId":"715501","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":715502,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Zheng Peng","affiliation":["Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, USA"],"lastName":"Fang Zheng Peng","id":"37278944800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2618"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0598"}],"articleNumber":"715502","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":354,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":4461},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":" \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIEEE Industry Applications Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ias/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Active filters","Power system harmonics","Power harmonic filters","Voltage","Harmonic analysis","Adaptive filters","Diodes","Rectifiers","Smoothing methods","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system harmonics","compensation","active filters","power filters","load (electric)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active power filters","nonlinear loads","harmonic sources","current harmonic source","voltage harmonic source","adaptive harmonic sources","compensation characteristics","series active filters","parallel active filter","overcurrent","diode rectifier","smoothing DC capacitor","power system","point of common coupling","network impedance","harmonic isolation function"]}],"abstract":"In this article, common nonlinear loads have been characterized into two types of harmonic sources, current-source type of harmonic source and voltage-source type of harmonic source. Compensation characteristics of both parallel active filters and series active filters have been discussed analytically and experimentally for these two types of harmonic sources. The corresponding required operation conditions, features, application issues, and adaptive harmonic sources of both filters have been presented. The fact that the traditional active filter, the parallel active filter, is not a panacea to harmonic compensation, and that one cannot use it blindly, has been clearly addressed. The parallel active filter will increase harmonic current and may cause overcurrent of the load when the load is a harmonic voltage source. Instead, it has been verified that the series active filter is better suited for compensation of a harmonic voltage source such as a diode rectifier with smoothing DC capacitor. The conclusions of this article also imply that when a parallel active filter is installed in a power system network such as at a point of common coupling, the network impedance and main harmonic sources downstream from the installation point should be investigated in order to get good performance and to minimize influence to the loads downstream. In some cases, a combined system of parallel active filter and series active filter may be necessary by utilizing the harmonic isolation function of the series active filters. No doubt active filters are superior to passive filters if used in their niche applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application issues of active power filters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Industry Applications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/2943.715502","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Industry Applications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel4/2943/15469/00715502.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2943.715502","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15469","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=715502","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/715502/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1998","displayDocTitle":"Application issues of active power filters","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6035815","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application issues of active power filters","sourcePdf":"00715502.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041711S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1998","isNumber":"15469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2943","citationCount":"354","articleId":"715502","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":715505,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This article has detailed the implementation of a parallel active filter, which is integrated within a 450 kW adjustable speed drive to provide an overall system which conforms to IEEE 519, and which provides significant benefits on a system level. The design of the active filter is seen to be driven by overall system specifications which include input current THD, efficiency, displacement power factor, a high level of integration with the load converter, and cost targets. Active filter operation and control has been analyzed at a detailed level, and fundamental issues relating to current regulator topology and operation, limits on compensation capability, DC bus control, switching frequency ripple suppression, etc., have all been addressed, and have all been shown to be very important in terms of helping the system meet its performance objectives. The overall drive system including the active filter, meets IEEE 519 by reducing the supply current THD from 26.8% without the active filter to 4.1% with the active filter operating. This is achieved in presence of supply voltage THD of 2.3% and filter terminal voltage V/sub f/ unbalance of 1.3% and, includes an ASD load induced subharmonic component at 33 Hz. Further, individual harmonic limits are met up to the 35th harmonic.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/715508/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6035818","displayDocTitle":"Active filter system implementation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active filter system implementation","sourcePdf":"00715508.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0413S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1998","isNumber":"15469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2943","citationCount":"213","articleId":"715508","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":715515,"authors":[{"name":"M.G.M.

A quantitative comparison between the two neural networks' performance has been provided on the base of the labelled areas.","doi":"10.1109/NAFIPS.1998.715525","pdfPath":"/iel4/5773/15417/00715525.pdf","startPage":"39","endPage":"43","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 Conference of the North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society - NAFIPS (Cat.

In this paper an additional improvement is given, which speeds up training in forecasting, and which can improve network performance. Normally the inputs to a neural network are technical indicators; this is better than showing raw data to the network. The optimisation of the parameters necessary for these indicators is a separate operation from the weight training and topology optimisation. In the approach presented the optimisation of these parameters is included into the weight training stage, thus removing one level of optimisation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/715529/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Aug 1998","conferenceDate":"20-21 Aug. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6047730","displayDocTitle":"Improving fuzzy neural networks using input parameter training","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving fuzzy neural networks using input parameter training","confLoc":"Pensacola Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00715529.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075786S","chronDate":"20-21 Aug 1998","isNumber":"15417","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5773","citationCount":"2","articleId":"715529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":715530,"authors":[{"name":"M.H.

This new class of neural networks helps address two main issues arising in time-dependent modeling environments. Firstly, these neural networks capture the underlying logical fabric of the problem and, secondly, they provide a useful insight into the temporal nature of the modeling environment. The authors show that the continuously changeable temporal environment gives rise to a logical transformation of the introduced model. This transformation is implemented by triggering from its original AND-like nature to an OR-like version, with this triggering regarded as a function of time. This paper discusses fuzzy decision-making in detail, particularly real estate problem solving.","doi":"10.1109/NAFIPS.1998.715530","startPage":"59","endPage":"63","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 Conference of the North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society - NAFIPS (Cat.

Applications are speech generation and speech recognition. The designs could be the basis for a computer program to realise an HMM; or they could be inspiration for a special purpose piece of hardware. The designs have two parts. The first determines the time sequence of hidden states. Although the design uses mainly standard logic components, the behaviour will be similar to a backpropagation layer of ANNs. The second part consists of one or more layers of feedforward AN processing elements in a standard backpropagation network with final outputs coded speech data. For training an HMM recognizer, the normal approach is to use the Viterbi Algorithm followed by fine tuning using the Baum Welch re-estimation algorithm. The ANN-HMM can be trained this way, but it can also be trained by the backpropagation algorithm, BP. The latter ties very directly to the unknown weights in the ANN circuits and may facilitate topological design.","doi":"10.1109/NAFIPS.1998.715596","publicationTitle":"1998 Conference of the North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society - NAFIPS (Cat.

One important example of this class of algorithms is MPEG encoding. In MPEG encoding, the mean square error search criterion achieves better compression quality than the mean absolute distance criterion. However, the mean absolute distance approach is recognized in the literature as more efficient in terms of speed. Our research indicates that the mean square error approach becomes much more attractive as instruction-level parallelism (ILP) increases. In a general-purpose processor that can exploit a high degree of instruction-level parallelism, the mean square error approach yields both better performance and better compression quality. Additional algorithms should likewise be re-evaluated to ensure efficient execution on high-ILP machines.","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.1998.715775","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems.

The implementation of discrete signals has led to the definition of many different discrete TFD. The spectral decomposition of the kernel allows the computation of the generalized discrete-time TFD (GDTFD) as a weighted sum of spectrograms with orthonormal windows. The partial sum offers the user a vehicle to perform trade-off between exactness and computational requirement. We extend this idea by showing that the combination of incremental refinement and approximating structure along with the spectral decomposition-based GDTFD provides more flexibility and a variety of trade-offs between approximation quality and computational cost. The paper discusses aspects of a suitable VLSI architecture featuring modular structure, local connections and reconfigurable logic module for implementation. The result serves as a basis to design a programmable core for computing GDTFD within an integrated mechatronic system targeting fault detection.","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.1998.715781","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems.

Although the DMT can achieve rate-adaptive data transmission compared with other modulation/demodulation schemes, its computational complexity is too high for cost-efficient implementations. For example, it requires 512-point IFFT/FFT as the modulation/demodulation kernel. The large block size results in heavy computational load in running programmable digital signal processors (DSP). We derive a computationally efficient fast algorithm for the IFFT/FFT. The proposed algorithm requires only 22% of the multiplications needed with the conventional butterfly approach. Also, it can avoid complex-domain operations that are inevitable in conventional IFFT/FFT computation. The resulting software function requires less MIPS count and program storage in firmware development of the IFFT/FFT module. Hence, it is very suitable for DSP-based DMT implementation. The proposed algorithm can also be applied to the technology of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) which is the processing kernel of the digital audio/video broadcasting (DAB/DVB) systems.","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.1998.715798","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems.

These deterministic approaches employ a least squares error metric, and then solve the problem algebraically. We use a NN to solve the estimation problem by mapping the quadratic cost function to the NN energy function, which is then minimized by iteratively updating each of its nodes (clusters of neurons called \"affinity cells\"). While its performance is found to be comparable to the SVD-based least squares methods, the NN offers significant practical advantages stemming from its distributed and fault-tolerant nature. Another important benefit of the NN approach, in contrast to the algebraic approaches, is its natural ability to yield the best solution in the space of finite word-length parameter vectors.","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.1998.715801","startPage":"386","endPage":"395","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems.

The design of this processor has been undertaken as one of two cases in a recently proposed method for the quantitative analysis of domain-specific dataflow architectures. The method presupposes that the exploration of the processor's design space starts out of a given architecture template whose free parameters are to be determined in such a way that the ultimate specification is in some sense optimal for a set of applications that are given from the outset. Two templates have been considered in the Jacobium case: one for the complete (multiple processor element) processor and one for a typical processor element (PE). A parametrized VHDL version of the latter has been designed as well. The architecture of such a typical PE is presented here. It is equipped with a deep floating point Cordic pipeline, on-chip multiport memory to buffer operands and results, and several high-speed communication buses for communication between processing elements and the host. This parametrized architecture serves two purposes: it can provide realistic estimates for the PE parameters at the level of the complete processor; and it can be used to validate the exploration results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pipelines","Jacobian matrices","Process design","Symmetric matrices","Data analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","Jacobian matrices","data flow computing","pipeline processing","floating point arithmetic","hardware description languages","parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["floating-point Cordic pipeline","Jacobium processing elements","dataflow processor","Jacobian symmetric matrix","Givens rotations","multiple processor element","VHDL","on-chip multiport memory","buffering","high-speed communication buses","parameter estimates"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=715803","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.1998.715803","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems.

Orthogonal IIR digital filters can achieve a sharp transition band and have good finite word-length behavior and are used in many modern DSP applications such as mobile communications. However, Cordic-based fine-grain pipelined true orthogonal IIR digital filters have not been developed so far. A state-space-based novel algorithm for designing fine-grain pipelined true orthogonal IIR digital filters is proposed using the matrix lookahead technique. The algorithm only involves applying orthogonal transformations that are known to be numerically very reliable, and therefore is ideal for VLSI implementations. The proposed filter architecture can be operated at arbitrarily high sample rates and achieves linear increase in hardware complexity with respect to the filter order and pipelining level. It consists of only Givens rotations which can be mapped onto Cordic arithmetic-based processors. Finally, an intermediate frequency filter for the USA mobile telephone system is designed using the proposed orthogonal filter synthesis algorithm.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.1998.715804","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.1998.715804","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems.

The key to the suitability of the FPGA for these applications is the fact that each of its basic blocks is capable of processing a digit size of up to 8 bits. A novel digit-serial FPGA logic block architecture has been proposed to satisfy the requirement of rapid prototyping and efficient implementation of digit-serial DSP applications. Digit-serial DSP designs using the digit-serial FPGA are compared to those implemented on a Xilinx FPGA chip.

DG2VHDL automatically translates a dependence graph (DG) into a synthesizable, behavioral VHDL entity that can be input to industrial-strength behavioral compilers for producing silicon implementations of the algorithm (FPGA, ASIC). The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) was selected to demonstrate that the tool facilitates the rapid prototyping of modular parallel structures for non-trivial algorithms with non-regular data dependency structure. In addition, the DWT is an important algorithm for data compression and feature extraction, among many other real-time DSP applications. We demonstrate here that the behavioral VHDL code produced automatically by the tool leads, after behavioral synthesis, to an efficient distributed memory and control modular array architecture which can be embedded into a single FPGA.","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.1998.715811","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems.

This raises the need for programmable but small processor cores to handle control of operation as well as communication and synchronization between the different functional modules on the chip. We have developed a soft core generator for highly parameterizable RISC-cores. The instruction word width can be arbitrarily chosen between 8 and 32 bits. Independent of this, the data-path width can be selected between 8 and 64 bits respectively. DSP-like performance can be achieved with the instantiation of a 64-bit (splittable-) MAC-unit in the data-path. The number of registers is arbitrarily scalable. The resulting cores are generated in RTL-VHDL and are fully synthesizable. Worst-case timing simulation shows 100 MHz achievable clock-speed using a 3LM 0.5 /spl mu/m standard-cell technology. The size of the synthesized cores ranges from 900 gates for a multi-cycle 8 bit core to 10k gates for a 5-stage pipelined 32 bit core with 8 registers. Interfaces and behavioral models are provided for instruction and data memories as well as a runnable VHDL testbench with basic test patterns. As a result, a 16 bit RISC core with instruction and data memories can be implemented on 1 mm/sup 2/ of silicon area in a 0.35 /spl mu/m technology.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A core generator for fully synthesizable and highly parameterizable RISC-cores for system-on-chip designs","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems.

No solutions for the general case are known that solve both problems at once. The present paper describes a programming model that allows to solve both problems for the special case of neural network learning algorithms, even for irregular networks with dynamically changing topology (constructive neural algorithms). The model is based on the observation that such algorithms predominantly execute local operations (on nodes and connections of the network), reductions, and broadcasts. The model is concretized in an object-centered procedural language called CuPit. The language is completely abstract: No aspects of the parallel implementation such as number of processors, data distribution, process distribution, execution model etc. are visible in user programs. The compiler can derive most information relevant for the generation of efficient code from unannotated source code. Therefore, CuPit programs are efficiently portable. A compiler for CuPit has been built for the MasPar MP-1/MP-2 using compilation techniques that can also be applied to most other parallel machines. The paper shortly presents the main ideas of the techniques used and results obtained by the various optimizations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Nov 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/715977/","accessionNumber":"6062432","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-14 Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A parallel programming model for irregular dynamic neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A parallel programming model for irregular dynamic neural networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00715977.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030635S","chronDate":"12-14 Nov 1997","isNumber":"15522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5824","citationCount":"1","articleId":"715977","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":716200,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

Koch et al. developed an energy equation whose coefficients remained constant. This paper presents an edge detection method for images where contrast is not uniform. It shows an way of changes in coefficients of the line process energy equation. Besides, use of neural network helps to reduce noise, thereby making human intervention unnecessary in the detection of edge.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1993.716765","startPage":"1223","endPage":"1226 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","pdfPath":"/iel4/5797/15523/00716765.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1993.716765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15523","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Edge detection by neural network with line process","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Neural networks","Neurons","Equations","Humans","Object detection","Lighting","Relaxation methods","Hopfield neural networks","Image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","image processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","neural network","image processing","gray level discontinuity","contrast variation","line process energy equation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/716765/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","displayDocTitle":"Edge detection by neural network with line process","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","accessionNumber":"4951258","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Edge detection by neural network with line process","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00716765.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028826S","chronDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","isNumber":"15523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5797","citationCount":"5","articleId":"716765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":716769,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

The proposed implementation of the invariant system consists of a feature extractor (a third-order neural network) and a trainable classifier (a single-layer linear associative memory). A single parameter, sphericity, which represents the similarity of two triangles, is introduced into the third-order neural network structures, from which the invariant feature vector is extracted. In this way, the invariant pattern recognition problem can be formulated and the invariance property can be proven under the assumption that the input pattern is continuous. The vast storage requirement usually encountered in higher-order networks is overcome, since only the activated pixels have to be processed in our scheme. Translation invariance is guaranteed by our invariant structure for the grid transformation of the binary image. Simulation results for typed numerals with different feature vector lengths show that the invariant system achieves 100% recognition accuracy for rotated and scaled patterns, respectively. Accuracy up to 95.11% is achieved for the random combination of rotated and scaled patterns. A 99.60% success rate for combined transformation is achieved for the recognition of various aircraft figures.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1993.716777","startPage":"1273","endPage":"1276 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1993.716777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15523","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","pdfPath":"/iel4/5797/15523/00716777.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Invariant pattern recognition using higher-order neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/716777/","displayDocTitle":"Invariant pattern recognition using higher-order neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"4951270","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Invariant pattern recognition using higher-order neural networks","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00716777.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040087S","chronDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","isNumber":"15523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5797","citationCount":"1","articleId":"716777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":716783,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The unification neural networks form a mechanism that derives the correct category from conflicting results, and is useful for promoting recognition applications that demand high reliability.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1993.716798","startPage":"1369","endPage":"1372 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1993.716798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15523","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","pdfPath":"/iel4/5797/15523/00716798.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective function learning neural network which unifies conflicting results of multiple methods for distorted handprinted Kanji pattern recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/716798/","displayDocTitle":"Selective function learning neural network which unifies conflicting results of multiple methods for distorted handprinted Kanji pattern recognition","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"4956553","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective function learning neural network which unifies conflicting results of multiple methods for distorted handprinted Kanji pattern recognition","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00716798.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042875S","chronDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","isNumber":"15523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5797","articleId":"716798","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":716802,"authors":[{"name":"Bao-Liang Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"lastName":"Bao-Liang Lu","id":"37288124100"},{"name":"Yan Bai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"lastName":"Yan Bai","id":"37364580700"},{"name":"Hajime Kita","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"lastName":"Hajime Kita","id":"37360219300"},{"name":"Y.

This rule allows for a systematic construction of the weight matrix and bias inputs of a recurrent network of Hopfield type. For efficiently finding solutions to the problem given, an appropriate neuron dynamic with optimization property has to be defined. There are several proposals like the Hopfield network or the Boltzmann machine. Some of these models get trapped in local minima or have arbitrary parameters. In this paper, a new neuron model is derived from the rolling-stone scheme, which is a global optimization method. The results of a simulation are compared to a Hopfield network for solving the N-queens problem.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1993.716825","startPage":"1481","endPage":"1484 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","pdfPath":"/iel4/5797/15523/00716825.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1993.716825","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15523","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Problem solving by global optimization: the rolling-stone neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Problem-solving","Neural networks","Neurons","Optimization methods","Constraint optimization","Design optimization","Proposals","Test pattern generators","Expert systems","Output feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hopfield neural nets","problem solving","optimisation","constraint handling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["problem solving","global optimization","rolling-stone neural network","constraint satisfaction","weight matrix","Hopfield neural net","recurrent network","neuron dynamic","optimization","Boltzmann machine","N-queens problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/716825/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","displayDocTitle":"Problem solving by global optimization: the rolling-stone neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","accessionNumber":"4951273","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Problem solving by global optimization: the rolling-stone neural network","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00716825.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034904S","chronDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","isNumber":"15523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5797","citationCount":"2","articleId":"716825","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":716827,"authors":[{"name":"K.

But, the disadvantages of HNN are that it can often converge at local minimum and the quality of solutions depends on the initial state because of sensitivity of parameterization. On the other hand, SA is designed to cope with the problem of convergence to a local minimum. SA, however, requires unacceptably large computing time. So, a new algorithm called mean field annealing (MFA) which can be interpreted as a generalization of HNN, is applied to optimization problems efficiently. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on MFA to solving of the minimization problem. Also we show that our approach can be applied to multi-layer as well as two-layer routing, and optimal solutions can be obtained by properly adjusting the parameter in the given energy function.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","pdfPath":"/iel4/5797/15523/00716828.pdf","startPage":"1495","endPage":"1498 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1993.716828","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1993.716828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15523","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=716828","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach to via minimization problem in VLSI chip design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Chip scale packaging","Wire","Minimization","Topology","Integrated circuit interconnections","Intelligent networks","Educational institutions","Systems engineering and theory","Hopfield neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimisation","simulated annealing","integrated circuit design","VLSI","Hopfield neural nets","convergence of numerical methods","network routing","circuit CAD"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI chip design","minimization","Hopfield neural networks","simulated annealing","combinatorial optimization","convergence","mean field annealing","energy function","multi-layer routing","two-layer routing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/716828/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","displayDocTitle":"A new approach to via minimization problem in VLSI chip design","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4951276","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach to via minimization problem in VLSI chip design","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00716828.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029202S","chronDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","isNumber":"15523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5797","articleId":"716828","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":716832,"authors":[{"name":"Kwok-Wai Cheung","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Kwok-Wai Cheung","id":"37087144791"},{"name":"Tong Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Tong Lee","id":"37087142299"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1421-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"716832","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":25},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=716832","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Neural networks","Neurons","Symmetric matrices","Linear programming","Integer linear programming","Quadratic programming","Artificial neural networks","Parallel architectures","Traveling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hopfield neural nets","mathematical programming","convergence of numerical methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network convergence","neural network","higher order programming","higher-order Hopfield network","non-zero self-reinforcing terms","network oscillation","reshaping strategy"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1993.716832","pdfPath":"/iel4/5797/15523/00716832.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","startPage":"1507","endPage":"1511 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15523","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1993.716832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the convergence of neural network for higher order programming","abstract":"Hopfield network, which was firstly proposed in 1982, can deal with only quadratic programming.

Until recently, the values of these coefficients were decided based on experience and trial and error. Therefore, solutions that satisfy the constraints could not be obtained and the quality of the solutions was not good. In order to avoid this problem, we propose a method to control cost coefficient values automatically while keeping a constraint coefficient to be constant. We applied this method to the Travelling Salesman Problem, and obtained near-optimal solutions more efficiently than other approaches. The proposed algorithm is very effective especially for the difficult city allocations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/716870/","accessionNumber":"4951284","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cost coefficient control method for solving optimization problems on Hopfield-type neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost coefficient control method for solving optimization problems on Hopfield-type neural networks","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00716870.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057075S","chronDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","isNumber":"15523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5797","citationCount":"2","articleId":"716870","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":716875,"authors":[{"name":"D.W.

The vastness of search space precludes the use of brute force techniques such as exhaustive enumeration. The problem of designing codes so that each code repels others (in the sense of hamming distance) fits well in the framework of neural networks. Formulating an energy function to design codes is very difficult and cannot satisfactorily be solved by Hopfield neural network model. To alleviate these problems, a probabilistic neural network model is proposed. The usefulness of the proposed model is investigated with respect to maximal distance codes and constant weight codes. Results of some code parameters that have been designed using the proposed model are presented.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1993.716907","startPage":"1590","endPage":"1593 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1993.716907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15523","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","pdfPath":"/iel4/5797/15523/00716907.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A probabilistic neural network for designing good codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/716907/","displayDocTitle":"A probabilistic neural network for designing good codes","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"4951299","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A probabilistic neural network for designing good codes","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00716907.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030753S","chronDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","isNumber":"15523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5797","articleId":"716907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":716910,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In general cases, however, the approximate models of the controlled robotic manipulators are available.

The tracking control of a MIMO flexible joint robot with high velocity is complicated due to the joint flexibilities, nonlinearities, and couplings. Our scheme consists of three ANN structures. The neural network identification (NNI) is used to obtain a dynamic model of a flexible joint robot to be controlled. Once the NNI has not closely learned the dynamic model of a flexible joint robot, the other new ANN structure, called hidden control neural network identification (HCNNI), is designed to overcoming the identification convergence problem in this paper. This HCNNI allows learning to compensate for poor identification and external disturbance. A third ANN control is designed for tracking control of a flexible joint robot based upon the identification. These tasks are completed using the backpropagation neural network.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1993.717009","pdfPath":"/iel4/5797/15523/00717009.pdf","startPage":"1825","endPage":"1828 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1993.717009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15523","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hidden control neural network identification-based tracking control of a flexible joint robot","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/717009/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","displayDocTitle":"Hidden control neural network identification-based tracking control of a flexible joint robot","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4956616","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hidden control neural network identification-based tracking control of a flexible joint robot","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00717009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035098S","chronDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","isNumber":"15523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5797","articleId":"717009","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":717013,"authors":[{"name":"Y.M.

Each neuron has an execution unit which is optimized for traditional neural functions, but the use of a micro-programming architecture makes it general enough to implement any neural function. Horizontal micro-instruction formats and massively parallel-pipelined computation allows high-speed on-chip learning. The theoretical maximum learning speed for the backpropagation algorithm is 1.25 GCUPS (giga connection updates per second). Eight digital neurons are integrated on each neuron chip by using 1.0-/spl mu/m CMOS technology, and 64 neuron chips are packaged in this hardware. This hardware can be connected to a host workstation by a SCSI network. We applied this neuro-computer to handwritten numerals recognition. The learning speed by using the neuro-computer is over 1000 times faster than by using the workstation.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1993.717042","startPage":"1967","endPage":"1970 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","pdfPath":"/iel4/5797/15523/00717042.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-93-Nagoya, Japan)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1993.717042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15523","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a high-performance general purpose neuro-computer composed of 512 digital neurons","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","CMOS technology","Computer architecture","Concurrent computing","Packaging","Workstations","Hardware","Neural networks","Circuits","Programmable control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","general purpose computers","peripheral interfaces","backpropagation","CMOS digital integrated circuits","character recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-performance general-purpose neurocomputer","digital neurons","optimized execution unit","microprogramming architecture","horizontal microinstruction formats","massively parallel-pipelined computation","high-speed on-chip learning","learning speed","backpropagation algorithm","CMOS technology","host workstation","SCSI network","handwritten numerals recognition","1.0 micron"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/717042/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","displayDocTitle":"Development of a high-performance general purpose neuro-computer composed of 512 digital neurons","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","accessionNumber":"4956649","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a high-performance general purpose neuro-computer composed of 512 digital neurons","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00717042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047431S","chronDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","isNumber":"15523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5797","citationCount":"8","articleId":"717042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":717044,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Sensors for measuring temperature, pressure, humidity, and acceleration are included in the initial system, which operates for more than 180 days and dissipates less than 700/spl mu/m from a 6V battery supply. The sensor scan rate is adaptive and can be event triggered. The system communicates internally over a 1MHz, 9-line intramodule sensor bus, and outputs data over a hardwired serial interface or a 315MHz wireless link.

The small chip size allows the assembly of the potentiostat together with monolithic microelectrodes on the same substrate.

Use of a cantilever beam array specifically designed for the measurement of in-use stiction showed a decrease in the work of adhesion from 42 mJ/m/sup 2/ for the hydrophilic release to less than, 0.3 mJ/m/sup 2/ for the NH/sub 4/F release processes.

The modulator is optimized for a wavelength of 1.3 /spl mu/m and intended for fiber-in-the- loop applications. It consists of a double-supported polysilicon beam separated from an underlying polysilicon electrode by an air gap. The two polysilicon electrodes form the mirrors of the Fabry-Perot cavity. By electrostatic actuation the optical path between the mirrors can be reduced, which results in modulation of the reflectivity. Characterization of the modulator shows a maximum on-off ratio of 9 dB. The observed modulator behaviour indicates a maximum modulation rate of 2.8 Mbit/s.","doi":"10.1109/SENSOR.1995.717175","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the International Solid-State Sensors and Actuators Conference - TRANSDUCERS '95","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the International Solid-State Sensors and Actuators Conference - TRANSDUCERS '95","pdfPath":"/iel4/5818/15511/00717175.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SENSOR.1995.717175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15511","startPage":"289","endPage":"292","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00717175.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MHz Opto-mechanical Modulator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=717175","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MHz Opto-mechanical Modulator","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/717175/","conferenceDate":"25-29 June 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MHz Opto-mechanical Modulator","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00717175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053917S","chronDate":"25-29 Jun 1995","isNumber":"15511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5818","citationCount":"5","articleId":"717175","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":717268,"authors":[{"name":"S.

For example, it was found that the sensitivity of individual subjects to dynamic color contrast in computer displays can be assessed by visual ERP's. It has also been observed that RMS measures of the P1-N1-P2 complex and the P300 component of the ERP are related to signal detection and classification measures of performance. The present effort is to classify the ERP response to stimuli followed by a motor action of the subject, using neural networks. The stimuli consist of flashing a light which could be either one of two distinct colors. The following motor-action corresponds to pushing one of the two available buttons representing the two colors. The features will be selected from the Fast Walsh Transformation (FWT) of ERP observations and will be applied to appropriate Neural Networks to obtain a prediction of a possible response. Since a small number of features is derived from a lame section of available processed data and since the ERP data is diluted with noise and artifacts, there is a need to evaluate the effectiveness of this data compression towards efficient prediction of the future action of the subject. The present paper deals with this study.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Apr 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/717268/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-27 April 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Effect Of Data Compression Of ERP Signals Preprocessed By FWT Algorithm Upon A Neural Network Classifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect Of Data Compression Of ERP Signals Preprocessed By FWT Algorithm Upon A Neural Network Classifier","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"00717268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08515S","chronDate":"23-27 Apr 1990","isNumber":"15495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5810","articleId":"717268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":717298,"authors":[{"name":"Yafan Zhang","affiliation":["Sensor Design and Development, Delco Electronics Corporation, Kokomo, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Yafan Zhang","id":"37087385898"},{"name":"K.D.

The overall pressure sensor is digitally-compensated in EPROM and resolves 25mTorr over a dynamic range from 600 to 80OTorr. The pressure sensitivity is over 4000ppm/Torr for the segment devices while the uncompensated temperature coefficient of offset is about +2600ppm//spl deg/C.

Compilers, however, infrequently exploit program profiles, because, profiling a program requires a programmer to instrument and run the program. An attractive alternative is for the complier to statically estimate program profiles. This paper presents several new techniques for static branch prediction and profiling. The first technique combines multiple predictions of a branch's outcome into a prediction of the probability that the branch is taken. Another technique uses these predictions to estimate the relative execution frequency (i.e., profile) of basic blocks and control-flow edges within a procedure. A third algorithm uses local frequency estimates to predict the global frequency of calls, procedure invocations, and basic block and control-flow edge executions. Experiments on the SPEC92 integer benchmarks and Unix applications show that the frequently executed blocks, edges, and functions identified by our techniques closely match those in a dynamic profile.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.1994.717399","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of MICRO-27.

Modern benchmarks generate extremely long traces, resulting in problems with data storage, as well as very long simulation run times. More fundamentally, simulation generally does not provide significant insight into the factors that determine performance or a characterization of their interactions. This paper proposes a theoretical model of superscalar processor performance that addresses these shortcomings. Performance is viewed as an interaction of program parallelism and machine parallelism. Both program and machine parallelisms are decomposed into multiple component functions. Methods for measuring or computing these functions are described. The functions are combined to provide a model of the interaction between program and machine parallelisms and an accurate estimate of the performance. The computed performance, based on this model, is compared to simulated performance for six benchmarks from the SPEC 92 suite on several configurations of the IBM RS/6000 instruction set architecture.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MICRO-27.

The paper investigates a third type of machine design, which combines the advantages of code compatibility as in superscalars and the absence of complex dependency-checking logic from the decoder as in VLIW. In this design, a stream of scalar instructions is executed by the hardware and is simultaneously compacted into VLIW-type instructions, which are then stored in a structure called a shadow cache. When a shadow cache line contains the instructions requested by the fetch unit, the scalar instruction stream is preempted and all operations in the shadow cache line are simultaneously issued and executed. The mechanism that compacts instructions is called a fill unit, and was first proposed for dynamically compacting macrooperations into large executable units by Melvin, Shebanow, and Patt in 1988. We have extended their approach to directly handle data dependencies, delayed branches, and speculative execution (using branch prediction). This approach is evaluated using the MIPS architecture, and a six-functional-unit machine is found to be 52 to 108% faster than a single-issue processor for unrecompiled SPECint92 benchmarks.","doi":"10.1145/192724.192748","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MICRO-27.

Through a coupling of compile-time analysis routines and hardware synthesis tools, we automatically configure a given set of the hardware-programmable functional units (PFUs) and thus augment the base instruction set architecture so that it better meets the instruction set needs of each application. We refer to this new class of general-purpose computers as programmable instruction set computers (PRISC). Although similar in concept, the PRISC approach differs from dynamically programmable microcode because in PRISC we define entirely-new primitive datapath operations. We concentrate on the microarchitectural design of the simplest form of PRISC-a RISC microprocessor with a single PFU that only evaluates combinational functions. We briefly discuss the operating system and the programming language compilation techniques that are needed to successfully build PRISC and, we present performance results from a proof-of-concept study. With the inclusion of a single 32-bit-wide PFU whose hardware cost is less than that of a 1 kilobyte SRAM, our study shows a 22% improvement in processor performance on the SPECint92 benchmarks.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/192724.192749","doi":"10.1145/192724.192749","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MICRO-27.

This paper shows that the new class of transport triggered architectures requires fewer ports on the shared register file than traditional operation triggered architectures. This is achieved by programming data-transports instead of operations. Experiments with our extended basic block scheduler have shown that the reduction of the required number of register file ports is substantial. The average requirement for scalar applications is 0.50 read and 0.35 write ports per operation instead of 2 read and 1 write ports. Due to this reduction it is possible to execute 2 operations per cycle with a two-ported register file and 3.6 operations per cycle with a six-ported register file.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Register file port requirements of transport triggered architectures","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of MICRO-27.

The current iteration method is based on the analytical solution of the governing equation in a free space.

Both conventional and accurate nonstandard schemes are introduced. Unlike previous implementations, the proposed algorithm is derived from the complete form of Maxwell's equations. The wider spatial stencil near absorbing walls is limited by the use of compact operators. Improved accuracy is achieved by applying generalizations of the derivative definition and Pade approximations of FDTD stencils, while for the temporal integration the four-stage Runge-Kutta integrator is invoked. Efficient higher-order ABCs are imposed on the PML boundary in order to decrease absorbers' thickness and suppress the grazing incidence angle effect. A modified PML incorporating diverse conductivity profiles and a higher-order PML mesh expansion approach, are also discussed. Results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces dispersion errors and system computational requirements.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A higher-order FDTD technique for the implementation of enhanced dispersionless perfectly matched layers combined with efficient absorbing boundary conditions","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.717635","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel4/20/15516/00717635.pdf","startPage":"2736","endPage":"2739","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.717635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15516","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=717635","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/717635/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1998","displayDocTitle":"A higher-order FDTD technique for the implementation of enhanced dispersionless perfectly matched layers combined with efficient absorbing boundary conditions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","accessionNumber":"6043639","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A higher-order FDTD technique for the implementation of enhanced dispersionless perfectly matched layers combined with efficient absorbing boundary conditions","sourcePdf":"00717635.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035286S","chronDate":"Sept.  1998","isNumber":"15516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"25","articleId":"717635","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":717638,"authors":[{"name":"F.L.

The method is applied to the reconstruction of the complex permittivity profile of cylindrical inhomogeneous objects, that are illuminated by transverse magnetic incident waves, and is based on scattered far field measurements. Starting from an initial guess of the scatterer profile, the FEM is used to solve the forward problem, resulting in an estimate of the scattered field. The inverse process of updating the constitutive parameters of the scatterer is performed by the Polak-Ribiere algorithm by the use of which the difference between the measured and the estimated scattered data is minimized. The minimization procedure is carried out by a sensitivity analysis scheme based on the FEM and the introduction of the adjoint state vector.

At each iteration step, the updated conductivity distribution is used to solve a forward problem and two-layer backpropagation neural networks with nonlinear activation functions are employed for solving an inverse problem. This allows for a smaller computation time with respect to other iterative methods and, at the same time, yields accurate images. Comparison with results obtained by applying an existing impedance tomography algorithm illustrates the efficiency of the proposed iterative method.","doi":"10.1109/20.717686","startPage":"2940","endPage":"2943","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.717686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15516","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel4/20/15516/00717686.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An iterative algorithm for electrical impedance imaging using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/717686/","displayDocTitle":"An iterative algorithm for electrical impedance imaging using neural networks","volume":"34","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6043688","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An iterative algorithm for electrical impedance imaging using neural networks","sourcePdf":"00717686.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049681S","chronDate":"Sept.  1998","isNumber":"15516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"4","articleId":"717686","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":717687,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A short review of existing circuit models and physical models is presented and their shortcomings are discussed. Than a new circuit model is built basing on the physical model that takes into consideration both 1/f fluctuations in number of electrons on centers in the depletion layer of emitter p-n junction and fluctuations of recombination rate in the base and emitter neutral regions. In the model we have introduced and found not only 1/f noise currents but 1/f parameters fluctuations of BJT nonlinear model (recombination conductivity, emitter-base capacitance). It was shown that in some particular cases this model can be reduced to Plumb-Chenette model and to the model presented and used in our previous papers. The conditions of using of the simplified models are formulated. An example of the model application is presented. It is connected with investigation of 1/f PM noise compensation effect in BJT amplifier. Results of experimental testing of this effect are given. It is shown that minimal level of 1/f PM noise can be explained by emitter-base capacitance fluctuations.

As a contribution to understanding of phase noise generation, two identified mechanisms are analysed. The first one involves nonlinearities. It may be, for example, the nonlinear V-I relationship of the base-emitter transistor junction. In that case this nonlinearity causes the noise spectrum of transistor to be transferred around the RF signal carrier by means of intermodulation. There is no way to avoid such a nonlinearity in an oscillator. For this reason the amplitude of the RF signal is limited. The second one deals with conversion of amplitude noise to phase noise. This may be for example the effect of the parasitic capacitance of the collector-base junction modulated by the amplitude noise or by the signal itself. The effects of those two mechanisms are analysed with help of a simulation software and results are applied to the closed loop of a typical 10 MHz quartz crystal oscillator. Consequences on the power spectral density of its phase fluctuations and the resulting time-domain instabilities of the oscillator frequency are presented and discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/717900/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 May 1998","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29-29 May 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"6219905","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of the effects of intermodulation and amplitude to phase conversion in a transistor stage upon the oscillator phase noise","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of the effects of intermodulation and amplitude to phase conversion in a transistor stage upon the oscillator phase noise","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00717900.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028497S","chronDate":"27-29 May 1998","isNumber":"15518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5822","citationCount":"4","articleId":"717900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":717906,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This paper presents a novel DAC response called Slewer Fractional-Order-Hold or just Fractional-Order-Hold (/spl Delta/OH) which is designed to optimize DAC performance in DDSs. This Fractional-Order-Hold response also applies to Sample-and-Hold (S&H) output waveforms where the S&H follows a DAC. The conventional DAC response modeled with the Zero-Order-Hold (ZOH) response may be largely responsible for the shortcomings of DAC specifications for the DDS application where low spurs are desired. Conventional definitions of differential and integral nonlinearity (DNL and INL) are only applicable to the settled state, and glitch area and settling time specifications for the transient are inadequate when spurs are a concern. First, this paper discusses how the dynamic linearity, glitch area, and other DAC response parameters affect spur levels in a DDS. Second, this paper describes the novel /spl Delta/OH response and compares its performance to that of other conventional responses such as the ZOH. Finally, this paper discusses a newly patented DAC design, the Smooth Transition Digital-to-Analog Converter (STDAC), which strives to implement the /spl Delta/OH response. The STDAC improves on prior art by applying the /spl Delta/OH that rigorously defines how the waveform should dynamically make the transitions, from one settled output level to another, optimizing these transitions to minimize DAC spurs.","doi":"10.1109/FREQ.1998.717931","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium (Cat.

The subject was spurred on initially by the requirements of pulse compression radar, and became a practical reality with the planar interdigital transducer, dating from 1965. The accessibility of the propagation path gave rise to substantial versatility, and a huge variety of devices were developed. Passive SAW devices are now ubiquitous, with applications ranging from professional radar and communications systems to consumer areas such as TV, pagers and mobile phones. The paper describes the extensive work, particularly in the 1970s, to investigate SAW propagation in crystalline media, including piezoelectric coupling diffraction and temperature effects. This led to identification of many suitable materials. Concurrently, many devices began development, including pulse compression filters, bandpass filters, resonators, oscillators, convolvers and matched filters for spread spectrum. In the 1970s, many of these became established in professional systems, and the SAW bandpass filter became a standard component for domestic TV. In the 1980s and 9Os, SAW responded to the new call for low-loss filters, particularly for mobile phones. With losses as low as 2 dB required (and subsequently achieved) at RF frequencies around 900 MHz, a raft of new technologies was developed. Additionally, for IF filters special techniques were evolved to reduce the physical size needed for narrow bandwidths. Such devices are now manufactured in very large quantities. In order to satisfy these needs, new types of surface wave, particularly transverse leaky waves, were investigated, and materials using such waves now have their place alongside more traditional materials.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FREQ.1998.717937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15518","startPage":"439","endPage":"460","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium (Cat.

It will be changed to another locked-in digital vector when it receives another input. 3. The speed is fast because the circuit is free-running, parallel, and M-ary. The accuracy is high because the computation is digital. Because of these unique properties, the network can be used in the design of a fast computing system. This paper reports the origin of this multi-zero system, the analysis of its properties, and the design of a fast, M-ary, digital multiplier using this system.","doi":"10.1109/ELECTR.1991.718262","pdfPath":"/iel4/5819/15514/00718262.pdf","startPage":"492","endPage":"497","displayPublicationTitle":"Electro International, 1991","publicationTitle":"Electro International, 1991","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ELECTR.1991.718262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Computation Using Multi-Zero Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/718262/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 April 1991","displayDocTitle":"Fast Computation Using Multi-Zero Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"16-18 April 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Computation Using Multi-Zero Neural Networks","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00718262.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050834S","chronDate":"16-18 April 1991","isNumber":"15514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5819","citationCount":"1","articleId":"718262","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":718276,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The first layer is a neural network, trained by unsupervised learning, that detects syllable boundaries and provides a representation of the phonetic content of each syllable. The next layer provides a phonernic representation of the syllable. Each cell of the third layer represents a particular syllable. Multiple cell activations at this layer represent the syllables of an utterance: a phrase or a multisyllabic word. The temporal-discriminant cell, whose activation depends on the sequence of activations at its inputs, is used to disambiguate the pattern in the syllable-cell layer. Each cell of the the fourth layer represents a particular word or phrase. Because a syllable cannot be precisely defined in phonetic terms, and because of the variations of articulation and the boundary effects of adjoining words, different syllables will be identified in different utterances of a word. The neural network structure presented here has a procedure for incorporating alternate representations of words, based on the variations of syllabification that occur in connected speech. The procedure is activated by the misrecognition of a particular word or phrase during supervised learning. A broad class of alternate syllabifications, including the migration of a consonant from syllable-final to syllable-initial position (of the following syllable), are encompassed by a single training step. The learning procedure is demonstrated through simple examples.","doi":"10.1109/ELECTR.1991.718279","startPage":"580","endPage":"585","displayPublicationTitle":"Electro International, 1991","pdfPath":"/iel4/5819/15514/00718279.pdf","publicationTitle":"Electro International, 1991","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ELECTR.1991.718279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Syllable Segmentation Of Continuous Speech Using Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Neural networks","Rhythm","Multi-layer neural network","Speech recognition","Contracts","Natural languages","Energy states","Unsupervised learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/718279/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 April 1991","displayDocTitle":"Robust Syllable Segmentation Of Continuous Speech Using Neural Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-18 April 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Syllable Segmentation Of Continuous Speech Using Neural Networks","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00718279.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071123S","chronDate":"16-18 April 1991","isNumber":"15514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5819","citationCount":"2","articleId":"718279","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":718280,"authors":[{"name":"S.L.

Under the WTMM representation, we can characterize the blocking effect of a JPEG decoded image as: (1) small modulus maxima at block boundaries over smooth regions; (2) noise or irregular structures near strong edges; and (3) corrupted edges across block boundaries. The WTMM representation not only provides characterization of the blocking effect, but also enables simple and local operations to reduce the adverse effect due to this problem. The proposed algorithm first performs a segmentation on a JPEG decoded image to identify the texture regions by noting that their WTMM have small variation in regularity. We do not process the modulus maxima of these regions, to avoid the image texture being \"oversmoothed\" by the algorithm. Then, the singularities in the remaining regions of the blocky image and the small modulus maxima at block boundaries are removed. We link up the corrupted edges, and regularize the phase of modulus maxima as well as the magnitude of strong edges. Finally, the image is reconstructed using the projection onto convex set (POCS) technique on the processed WTMM of that JPEG decoded image. This simple algorithm improves the quality of a JPEG decoded image in the senses of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as well as the visual quality. We also compare the performance of our algorithm to the previous approaches, such as CLS and POCS methods. The most remarkable advantage of the WTMM deblocking algorithm is that we can directly process the edges and texture of an image using its WTMM representation.","doi":"10.1109/83.718489","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/15529/00718489.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.718489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15529","startPage":"1488","endPage":"1496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A deblocking technique for block-transform compressed image using wavelet transform modulus maxima","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=718489","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A deblocking technique for block-transform compressed image using wavelet transform modulus maxima","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/718489/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6045810","pubMedId":"18276215","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A deblocking technique for block-transform compressed image using wavelet transform modulus maxima","sourcePdf":"00718489.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038232S","chronDate":"Oct.  1998","isNumber":"15529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"45","articleId":"718489","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":718491,"authors":[{"name":"M.Z.

It takes advantage of a prior decomposition of sequences into video object planes (VOPs) so that each VOP represents one moving object. A comprehensive review summarizes some of the most important motion segmentation and VOP generation techniques that have been proposed. Then, a new automatic video sequence segmentation algorithm that extracts moving objects is presented. The core of this algorithm is an object tracker that matches a two-dimensional (2-D) binary model of the object against subsequent frames using the Hausdorff distance. The best match found indicates the translation the object has undergone, and the model is updated every frame to accommodate for rotation and changes in shape. The initial model is derived automatically, and a new model update method based on the concept of moving connected components allows for comparatively large changes in shape. The proposed algorithm is improved by a filtering technique that removes stationary background. Finally, the binary model sequence guides the extraction objects of the VOPs from the sequence. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of our algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/76.718500","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/15530/00718500.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.718500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15530","startPage":"525","endPage":"538","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic segmentation of moving objects for video object plane generation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=718500","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automatic segmentation of moving objects for video object plane generation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/718500/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","accessionNumber":"6045575","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic segmentation of moving objects for video object plane generation","sourcePdf":"00718500.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065668S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"189","articleId":"718500","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":718501,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique can efficiently segment video sequences with fast moving, newly appearing, or disappearing objects in the scene.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/718501/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","accessionNumber":"6045576","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"8","issue":"5","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised video segmentation based on watersheds and temporal tracking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised video segmentation based on watersheds and temporal tracking","sourcePdf":"00718501.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033917S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"193","articleId":"718501","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":718504,"authors":[{"name":"Chuang Gu","affiliation":["Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Chuang Gu","id":"37087148147"},{"name":"Ming-Chieh Lee","affiliation":["Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Ming-Chieh Lee","id":"37087385183"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"718504","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":161,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":544},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data mining","Humans","Video compression","Digital video broadcasting","Telecommunication computing","Image segmentation","Tracking","Morphology","Mathematical model","Satellite broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video signal processing","image segmentation","feature extraction","mathematical morphology","motion estimation","motion compensation","tracking","image sequences","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiautomatic segmentation","semiautomatic tracking","video sequences","semantic video object extraction system","mathematical morphology","perspective motion model","human visual system","supervised I-frame segmentation","unsupervised P-frame tracking","semantic video object boundary","human assistance","morphological segmentation tool","global perspective motion estimation","global perspective motion compensation","boundary refinement","set theory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=718504","abstract":"This paper introduces a novel semantic video object extraction system using mathematical morphology and a perspective motion model.

In order to obtain regions for local feature extraction, a new spatio-temporal segmentation and region-tracking scheme is employed. The segmentation algorithm uses all three visual features: color, texture, and motion in the video data. A group processing scheme similar to the one in the MPEG-2 standard is used to ensure the robustness of the segmentation. The proposed approach can handle complex scenes with large motion. After segmentation, regions are tracked through the video sequence using extracted local features. The results of tracking are sequences of coherent regions, called \"subobjects\". Subobjects are the fundamental elements in our low-level content description scheme, which can be used to obtain meaningful physical objects in a high-level content description scheme.

Many visual feature representations have been explored and many systems built. While these research efforts establish the basis of CBIR, the usefulness of the proposed approaches is limited. Specifically, these efforts have relatively ignored two distinct characteristics of CBIR systems: (1) the gap between high-level concepts and low-level features, and (2) the subjectivity of human perception of visual content. This paper proposes a relevance feedback based interactive retrieval approach, which effectively takes into account the above two characteristics in CBIR. During the retrieval process, the user's high-level query and perception subjectivity are captured by dynamically updated weights based on the user's feedback. The experimental results over more than 70000 images show that the proposed approach greatly reduces the user's effort of composing a query, and captures the user's information need more precisely.","doi":"10.1109/76.718510","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/15530/00718510.pdf","startPage":"644","endPage":"655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.718510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relevance feedback: a power tool for interactive content-based image retrieval","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/718510/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","displayDocTitle":"Relevance feedback: a power tool for interactive content-based image retrieval","volume":"8","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","accessionNumber":"6045585","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relevance feedback: a power tool for interactive content-based image retrieval","sourcePdf":"00718510.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111894S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"968","articleId":"718510","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":718514,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The torso and the head are modeled as two rigid bodies connected at one point, and the Newton-Euler method is used to derive the nonlinear differential equations that govern the motion of the system. The two-link system is driven by six pairs of muscle like actuators that possess physiologically inspired alpha like and gamma like inputs, and spindle like and Golgi tendon organ like outputs. These outputs are utilized as reflex feedback for stability and stiffness control, in a long loop feedback for the purpose of estimating the state of the system (somesthesis), and as part of the input to the controller. Ideal delays of different duration are included in the feedforward and feedback paths of the system to emulate such delays encountered in physiological systems. Dynamical neural networks are trained to learn effective control of the desired maneuvers of the system. The feasibility of the controller is demonstrated by computer simulation of the successful execution of the desired maneuvers. This work demonstrates the capabilities of neural circuits in controlling highly nonlinear systems with multidelays in their feedforward and feedback paths. The ultimate long range goal of this research is toward understanding the working of the central nervous system in controlling movement. It is an interdisciplinary effort relying on mechanics, biomechanics, neuroscience, system theory, physiology and anatomy, and its short range relevance to rehabilitation must be noted.","doi":"10.1109/3477.718516","pdfPath":"/iel4/3477/15539/00718516.pdf","startPage":"653","endPage":"666","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.718516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated three-dimensional motion of the head and torso by dynamic neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/718516/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated three-dimensional motion of the head and torso by dynamic neural networks","volume":"28","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6036244","pubMedId":"18255985","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated three-dimensional motion of the head and torso by dynamic neural networks","sourcePdf":"00718516.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053967S","chronDate":"Oct.  1998","isNumber":"15539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"19","articleId":"718516","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":718518,"authors":[{"name":"Kao-Shing Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kao-Shing Hwang","id":"37087159370"},{"name":"Ching-Shun Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Shun Lin","id":"37087371531"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"718518","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":320},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Robots","Sliding mode control","Fuzzy control","Fuzzy systems","Control theory","Control systems","Organizing","Programmable control","Adaptive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robots","position control","cerebellar model arithmetic computers","variable structure systems","fuzzy neural nets","self-adjusting systems","uncertainty handling","inference mechanisms","neurocontrollers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smooth trajectory tracking","three-link robot","self organizing CMAC approach","neuro fuzzy system","conventional control theory","physical learning control problems","fuzzy sliding mode controller","state variables","switching hyperplane","desired trajectory","self organizing fuzzy cerebellar model articulation controller","adaptive heuristic critic","forward compensator","chattering effect","system uncertainties","geometrical explanation","smooth motion","control scheme"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=718518","abstract":"A neuro fuzzy system which is embedded in the conventional control theory is proposed to tackle physical learning control problems.

The analytical method is widely used in calculations of synchronous reactances of salient pole synchronous machines with electromagnetic excitation. Rotors of PM synchronous machines have more complicated structures, hence it is more difficult to predict accurately the magnetic field distribution in their airgaps in order to find the form factors of the stator field. Numerical methods of field analysis can easily solve this problem. The FEM can predict both the synchronous and mutual (armature reaction) reactances in the d and q axes. The leakage reactance can then be evaluated as a difference between synchronous and mutual reactances. As an example, a small, three-phase, four-pole motor with SmCo surface mounted PM's (three parallel magnets per pole), and mild-steel pole shoes has been investigated. Such a complicated rotor structure has been intentionally designed in order to be able to compare the advantages and disadvantages of the analytical method and the FEM. In the FEM, the reactances have been calculated using both the flux linkage and current/energy perturbation method. Synchronous reactances as functions of the stator current and load angle obtained analytically from the FEM modeling and from measurements have been compared.","doi":"10.1109/20.718533","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","startPage":"3712","endPage":"3720","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel4/20/15538/00718533.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.718533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15538","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Calculation of synchronous reactances of small permanent-magnet alternating-current motors: comparison of analytical approach and finite element method with measurements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic analysis","Stators","Synchronous motors","Armature","Synchronous machines","Permanent magnet motors","Finite element methods","Testing","Electromagnetic analysis","Magnetic fields"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronous motors","permanent magnet motors","machine theory","finite element analysis","electric reactance","rotors","stators","small electric machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronous reactance","permanent magnet alternating current motor","finite element method","analytical model","form factor","stator field","armature reaction factor","rotor","magnetic field distribution","airgap","mutual reactance","leakage reactance","PM synchronous machine","three-phase four-pole motor","SmCo surface mounted PM","mild steel pole","energy perturbation","flux linkage","current perturbation","SmCo"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Calculation of synchronous reactances of small permanent-magnet alternating-current motors: comparison of analytical approach and finite element method with measurements","volume":"34","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6043794","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/718533/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calculation of synchronous reactances of small permanent-magnet alternating-current motors: comparison of analytical approach and finite element method with measurements","sourcePdf":"00718533.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034357S","chronDate":"Sept.  1998","isNumber":"15538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"38","articleId":"718533","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":718535,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Deng","affiliation":["Delphi-Energy and Engine Management Systems, General Motors Corporation, Flint, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Fang Deng","id":"37361867900"},{"name":"T.W.

One source of imperfection is timing jitter where the rising and falling transitions do not occur at the nominal data transition time instants; nevertheless, the time instants are offset by random amounts relative to the nominal one. The amount of timing shift per transmission interval is random and is typically characterized by a discrete stationary random process (independent of the data sequence) with known statistical properties. The purpose of this paper is to characterize the power spectral density (PSD) of baseband signaling schemes in the presence of arbitrary timing jitter. Although general PSD results are first obtained for arbitrary timing jitter statistics, specific results are then given for the cases of practical interest, namely, uniform and Gaussian-distributed jitter. Examples of an uncorrelated data pulse stream, an independent identically distributed data stream, and a Markov source are given. Interesting results emerge when the generating sequence {a/sub n/} is uncorrelated. For generating sequences {a/sub n/} that are nonzero-mean, timing jitter has the effect of widening the main lobe of the spectrum and increasing the sidelobes. When the generating sequence is zero-mean and uncorrelated, a rather surprising result is that the timing jitter does not affect the PSD. Simulation results are also presented to verify the analysis.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/26/15537/00718556.pdf","startPage":"1135","endPage":"1145","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.718556","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.718556","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15537","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=718556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the power spectral density of digital pulse streams generated by M-ary cyclostationary sequences in the presence of stationary timing jitter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power generation","Pulse generation","Timing jitter","Signal design","Random processes","Baseband","Statistical distributions","Gaussian processes","Brain modeling","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["jitter","spectral analysis","sequences","telecommunication signalling","random processes","statistical analysis","Gaussian distribution","Markov processes","correlation methods","digital communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power spectral density","digital pulse streams","M-ary cyclostationary sequences","stationary timing jitter","spectral occupancy","spectral composition","digital signaling technique","nonideal data pulse stream","communication system design","timing shift per transmission interval","discrete stationary random process","statistical properties","baseband signaling","general PSD","timing jitter statistics","Gaussian-distributed jitter","uniform-distributed jitter","uncorrelated data pulse stream","independent identically distributed data stream","Markov source","uncorrelated generating sequence","nonzero-mean","sidelobes","main lobe","simulation results"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/718556/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","displayDocTitle":"On the power spectral density of digital pulse streams generated by M-ary cyclostationary sequences in the presence of stationary timing jitter","volume":"46","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","accessionNumber":"6030056","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the power spectral density of digital pulse streams generated by M-ary cyclostationary sequences in the presence of stationary timing jitter","sourcePdf":"00718556.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031882S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15537","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"31","articleId":"718556","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":718557,"authors":[{"name":"Heung-No Lee","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Heung-No Lee","id":"37615948100"},{"name":"G.J.

We assume a block adaptive receiver in which the receiver coefficients are obtained from feedforward channel estimation. For the feedforward channel estimation, we propose a novel reduced dimension channel estimation procedure, where the number of unknown parameters are reduced using a priori information of the transmit shaping filter's impulse response. Fewer unknown parameters require a shorter training sequence. We obtain least-squares, maximum-likelihood, and maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimators for the reduced dimension channel estimation problem. For symbol detection, we propose the use of a matched filtered diversity combining decision feedback equalizer (DFE) instead of a straightforward diversity combining DFE. The matched filter form has lower computational complexity and provides a well-conditioned matrix inversion. To cope with fast time-varying channels, we introduce a new DFE coefficient computation algorithm which is obtained by incorporating the channel variation during the decision delay into the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. We refer to this as the non-Toeplitz DFE (NT-DFE). We also show the feasibility of a suboptimal receiver which has a lower complexity than a recursive least squares adaptation, with performance close to the optimal NT-DFE.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/26/15537/00718557.pdf","startPage":"1146","endPage":"1162","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.718557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.718557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15537","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=718557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast adaptive equalization/diversity combining for time-varying dispersive channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diversity reception","Adaptive equalizers","Decision feedback equalizers","Channel estimation","Matched filters","Diversity methods","Rayleigh channels","Frequency diversity","Information filtering","Information filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-varying channels","adaptive equalisers","decision feedback equalisers","diversity reception","Rayleigh channels","fading","feedforward","radio receivers","least squares approximations","maximum likelihood estimation","signal detection","matched filters","computational complexity","matrix inversion","digital radio","land mobile radio","filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast adaptive equalization/diversity combining","fast Rayleigh-fading","frequency selective channels","block adaptive receiver","receiver coefficients","feedforward channel estimation","reduced dimension channel estimation","shaping filter impulse response","training sequence","least-squares estimator","maximum-likelihood estimator","maximum a posteriori estimator","MAP estimator","symbol detection","matched filtered diversity combining DFE","decision feedback equalizer","computational complexity","well-conditioned matrix inversion","time-varying channels","DFE coefficient computation algorithm","decision delay","minimum mean square error","MMSE","nonToeplitz DFE","suboptimal receiver","wireless digital communications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/718557/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","displayDocTitle":"Fast adaptive equalization/diversity combining for time-varying dispersive channels","volume":"46","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","accessionNumber":"6030057","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast adaptive equalization/diversity combining for time-varying dispersive channels","sourcePdf":"00718557.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096109S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15537","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"37","articleId":"718557","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":718558,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The basic structure we refer to is reminiscent of the decorrelating detector, but here the design strategy relies on the concept of combating jointly the two interference sources-precisely, a decision as to the bit transmitted by each user is made based on the projection of the observables onto the orthogonal complement to the subspace spanned by the other users' signatures and the narrow-band interference. We focus on several different implementations of such a strategy, assuming a different degree of prior knowledge as to the narrow-band interference. An important side result of the proposed approach is that, in general, complete suppression of data-like interference may be achieved through periodically time-varying processing. An adaptive version of such a receiver is also presented, wherein the projection direction is estimated based on suitable estimates of the covariance properties of the observables. The value of this method is also assessed by studying the rate of convergence of the estimated direction to the true projection direction.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Narrow-band-interference suppression in multiuser CDMA systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.718558","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/26/15537/00718558.pdf","startPage":"1163","endPage":"1175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.718558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15537","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=718558","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/718558/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","displayDocTitle":"Narrow-band-interference suppression in multiuser CDMA systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","accessionNumber":"6030058","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Narrow-band-interference suppression in multiuser CDMA systems","sourcePdf":"00718558.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027162S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15537","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"27","articleId":"718558","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":718559,"authors":[{"name":"E.D.J.

The signal characteristics of the two schemes are analyzed when a rectangular-shaped PN chip pulse is used, and it is shown that the proposed coherent DS-CDMA system has a constant envelope even in the presence of a transmitted phase reference. We simulate the signals to obtain the envelope variations when a spectrally efficient shaped PN chip pulse is used, and compare the results with those of conventional QPSK and orthogonal QPSK (OQPSK) PN modulation schemes.

This phenomena is particularly important in residential areas, where the houses are typically a few stories high. For the most part, the buildings were assumed to lie on level terrain, although shadowing effects by the terrain in the absence of buildings has been included. Previous works have offered a number of methods to quantitatively determine these effects from path profiles. This study examines propagation over buildings when the buildings are located on terrain features (hills). The buildings, which are represented by a series of absorbing half screens, are assumed to lie in rows that are equally spaced along parallel streets, with the streets running perpendicular to the terrain slope. Numerical results are obtained using successive repetition of the Kirchhoff-Huygens approximation. A phenomenological model based on ray optics for diffraction over a smooth surface is proposed as a way to interpret the numerical results. The dependence of the model coefficients on the terrain parameters are obtained from the numerical results.","doi":"10.1109/8.718568","startPage":"1138","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/15536/00718568.pdf","endPage":"1147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.718568","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/718568/","displayDocTitle":"Effect of terrain on path loss in urban environments for wireless applications","volume":"46","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6023525","publicationDate":"Aug. 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of terrain on path loss in urban environments for wireless applications","sourcePdf":"00718568.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026929S","chronDate":"Aug 1998","isNumber":"15536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"21","articleId":"718568","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":718570,"authors":[{"name":"J.B.

While the implementation of any of these sources is a straightforward procedure in FDTD simulations, ensuring an accurate correspondence between the physical source and its numerical implementation is challenging. We describe the implementation of a new field source, referred to as a transparent field source, that couples the same fields into the FDTD grid as a hard field source. Unlike the hard field source, however, the transparent source does not scatter energy, i.e., the usual FDTD update equation applies to the source node.

The radiation conductance is determined by the radiated power from the slot in the forms of space and surface waves in the spectral domain.

The feed network is built by connecting rectangular waveguides with T-junctions. The matching of the T-junctions is improved by using rounded splitters and matching pins in the junctions. The radiating element has been designed to cancel out the grating lobe. The grating lobe is due to an element spacing larger than one wavelength. The highest sidelobes are at least 31 dB below the main beam in the H-plane and 16 dB in the E-plane. A gain of 37 dBi has been achieved at 39.2 GHz.

This paper investigates the use of weight noise used during MLP training to compensate for the inherent errors encountered in VLSI implementations. Weight adaptation is conducted solely in software, eliminating the need for costly in-the-loop training. The particular VLSI implementation considered here is the EPSILON processor card developed at Edinburgh University. Both software and hardware experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. This case study with the EPSILON processor card highlights what we believe to be a number of common inadequacies with custom designed hardware. In particular, the limitations of EPSILON in terms of its dynamic range performance has been shown to be a problem. In summary, we show that networks trained with weight noise are fault-tolerant but also require an increased dynamic range to exploit this property.","doi":"10.1109/82.718593","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/15535/00718593.pdf","startPage":"1255","endPage":"1262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.718593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15535","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=718593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault tolerance via weight noise in analog VLSI implementations of MLPs-a case study with EPSILON","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/718593/","displayDocTitle":"Fault tolerance via weight noise in analog VLSI implementations of MLPs-a case study with EPSILON","volume":"45","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6031543","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault tolerance via weight noise in analog VLSI implementations of MLPs-a case study with EPSILON","sourcePdf":"00718593.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048978S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"27","articleId":"718593","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":718594,"authors":[{"name":"Hoi-Jun Yoo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hoi-Jun Yoo","id":"37274307200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7130"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-125X"}],"articleNumber":"718594","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=718594","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS logic circuits","Subthreshold current","Logic circuits","MOSFETs","Circuit simulation","SPICE","Threshold voltage","Optimization methods","Delay effects","Pulse inverters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS logic circuits","CMOS memory circuits","SPICE","DRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual threshold voltage self-timed CMOS logic","multigigabit synchronous DRAM","subthreshold current","SPICE simulation","MOS transistor","delay time","inverter chain","low-voltage DVST logic circuit","leakage current","wave pipeline architecture","0.8 to 1.5 V"]}],"abstract":"A subthreshold current reduction logic, the dual-V/sub T/ self-timed (DVST) logic, is developed for the possible application to multigigabit synchronous DRAM. Minimizing subthreshold current is a critical problem in low-voltage CMOS logic. DVST logic has potential advantages over conventional dual-V/sub T/ logic in terms of circuit delay, subthreshold current, operating voltage, and area consumption. A detailed comparison of the conventional logic and the DVST logic is carried out by SPICE simulation. Methods for the determination of the threshold voltages of low-and high-V/sub T/ MOS transistors, for the optimization of the width of the MOS transistors in the circuit, and for the determination of the delay time of the resetting signal are developed. Examples of basic logic blocks and inverter chains are illustrated with their simulation results. The DVST logic circuit in which the subthreshold leakage current path is blocked by a large high-V/sub T/ MOS transistor can reduce the subthreshold current to the same level of high-V/sub T/ logic. It can operate two times faster than the conventional dual-V/sub T/ logic at 1.0-V supply voltage by removing the limitation in /spl gamma/ of the dual-V/sub T/ logic. In the voltage range of 0.8-1.5 V it operates at even higher speed than the low-V/sub T/ logic and only below 0.7-V supply voltage it is exceeded by the low-V/sub T/ logic. Its application to synchronous DRAM, especially in the wave pipeline architecture of the data path, is described.","doi":"10.1109/82.718594","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.718594","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/15535/00718594.pdf","startPage":"1263","endPage":"1271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-V/sub T/ self-timed CMOS logic for low subthreshold current multigigabit synchronous DRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","displayDocTitle":"Dual-V/sub T/ self-timed CMOS logic for low subthreshold current multigigabit synchronous DRAM","volume":"45","issue":"9","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","accessionNumber":"6031544","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/718594/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-V/sub T/ self-timed CMOS logic for low subthreshold current multigigabit synchronous DRAM","sourcePdf":"00718594.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036018S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"10","articleId":"718594","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":718596,"authors":[{"name":"Chengshan Xiao","affiliation":["Wireless Network Nortel, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Chengshan Xiao","id":"37087174350"},{"name":"P.

The requirements for ultraclean environments and intricate production capabilities result in capital intensive facilities and equipment. Wafer fabrication involves hundreds of individual tools performing multiple processes to produce an array of sophisticated end products. Worldwide competitive realities produce ongoing pressures to reduce the time and cost of both development and manufacturing activities. Simulation provides a practical and powerful method for analyzing and optimizing such a complex environment. This paper presents an overview of a modeling and simulation effort designed to quantify turnaround time improvement opportunities in a leading-edge semiconductor development line. Product turnaround time is a key determinant of success in semiconductor manufacturing due to its contribution in critical areas including contamination, yield-learning, and process control. The focus of the simulation project was the analysis of line loading levels and their impact oil turnaround time. The results of the project led to policy changes and significantly improved turnaround time performance. The paper presents an overview of the line modeled, a discussion of the line characteristics incorporated in the model, and the simulation results. The changes implemented in the line are discussed, and the resultant improvements described.","doi":"10.1109/WSC.1989.718774","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00718774.png","startPage":"922","endPage":"929","publicationTitle":"1989 Winter Simulation Conference Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSC.1989.718774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15520","displayPublicationTitle":"1989 Winter Simulation Conference Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel4/5823/15520/00718774.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementing The Results Of A Manufacturing Simulation In A Semiconductor Line","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/718774/","displayDocTitle":"Implementing The Results Of A Manufacturing Simulation In A Semiconductor Line","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementing The Results Of A Manufacturing Simulation In A Semiconductor Line","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00718774.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043126S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec 1989","isNumber":"15520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5823","citationCount":"4","articleId":"718774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":718806,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We extend Papoulis' generalized sampling theory in two important respects. First, our class of admissible input signals (typ. H=L/sub 2/) is considerably larger than the subspace of band-limited functions. Second, we use a more general specification of the reconstruction subspace V(/spl psi/), so that the output of the system can take the form of a band-limited function, a spline, or a wavelet expansion. Since we have enlarged the class of admissible input functions, we have to give up Shannon and Papoulis' principle of an exact reconstruction. Instead, we seek an approximation f/spl isin/V(/spl psi/) that is consistent in the sense that it produces exactly the same measurements as the input of the system. This leads to a generalization of Papoulis' sampling theorem and a practical reconstruction algorithm that takes the form of a multivariate filter. In particular, we show that the corresponding system acts as a projector from H onto V(/spl psi/). We then propose two complementary polyphase and modulation domain interpretations of our solution. The polyphase representation leads to a simple understanding of our reconstruction algorithm in terms of a perfect reconstruction filter bank. The modulation analysis, on the other hand, is useful in providing the connection with Papoulis' earlier results for the band-limited case. Finally, we illustrate the general applicability of our theory by presenting new examples of interlaced and derivative sampling using splines.","doi":"10.1109/82.718806","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/15534/00718806.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.718806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15534","startPage":"959","endPage":"969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A generalized sampling theory without band-limiting constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=718806","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A generalized sampling theory without band-limiting constraints","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/718806/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1998","accessionNumber":"6031519","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A generalized sampling theory without band-limiting constraints","sourcePdf":"00718806.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075949S","chronDate":"Aug 1998","isNumber":"15534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"77","articleId":"718806","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":718807,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This allows a flexible schematization of the construction of semi-orthogonal multiwavelets. As in the scalar case, an efficient algorithm for the computation of the coefficients of a multiwavelet transform can be obtained, in which r input sequences are involved. This is a crucial point: the choice of a good prefilter which can provide a good approximation of the true initial coefficient sequences, when applied to the input data, is critical in the context of multiwavelet analysis. We explore this problem with concrete examples, showing the strong dependence of the prefilter on the chosen multiwavelet basis. Finally, an application of the multiwavelet-based algorithm to signal compression is shown. The goal is both to compare the results obtained with different multiwavelet bases, and to test the effectiveness of multiwavelets in this kind of problem with respect to scalar wavelets.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal analysis","Signal processing","Signal processing algorithms","Multiresolution analysis","Spline","Mathematics","Concrete","Testing","Polynomials","Fractals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transforms","signal processing","data compression","matrix algebra","approximation theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiwavelet analysis","signal processing","multiscaling functions","compact notation","recursive block matrices","semi-orthogonal multiwavelets","coefficient sequences approximation","multiwavelet-based algorithm","signal compression"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15534","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.718807","startPage":"970","endPage":"987","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/15534/00718807.pdf","doi":"10.1109/82.718807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiwavelet analysis and signal processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1998","displayDocTitle":"Multiwavelet analysis and signal processing","accessionNumber":"6031520","publicationDate":"Aug. 1998","volume":"45","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/718807/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiwavelet analysis and signal processing","sourcePdf":"00718807.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029613S","chronDate":"Aug 1998","isNumber":"15534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"72","articleId":"718807","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":718809,"authors":[{"name":"Liangchi Hsu","affiliation":["Nokia Research Center, Irving, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Liangchi Hsu","id":"37347657100"},{"name":"K.R.

A data loss concealment scheme is required to provide graceful degradation, especially in HDTV broadcast and transmission environments. The effect of \"drift\" artifacts is one of the major problems in a classical multiresolution video coding such as frequency scalable coding where different resolutions do not have their own accurate motion information. Our research not only exploits advantages of discrete wavelet transform and hierarchical OBMC to solve the \"drift\" problem, but also enhances MPEG scheme, which is applied for the lowest resolution, by replacing the DCT with the LOT, along with OBMC to significantly improve the data loss concealment and mitigate the degradation of picture quality due to transmission noise. Three resolutions at the constant bit rate (CBR) for applications to HDTV, conventional TV, and videophone are aimed at. Data loss concealment, for both intraframes and interframes, is illustrated, the elimination of \"drift\" artifacts is demonstrated, and the superiority of the enhanced MPEG scheme over the existing MPEG scheme is shown.

We begin with the development of systematic scheduling, which determines the filtering instants of each resolution level, on the basis of a binary tree. Then input-output relation between lattices of the QMF bank is derived, and a new structure for the data format converter (DFC) which controls the data transfer between resolution levels is proposed. In addition, implementation of a delay control unit (DCU) that controls the delay between lattices of the QMF is proposed. The structures for the DFC and DCU are regular, scalable, and require a minimum number of registers, and thereby lead to an efficient and scalable architecture for the DWT. A scalable architecture for the inverse DWT is also developed in a similar manner. Finally, pipelining of the proposed architecture is considered.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable VLSI architectures for lattice structure-based discrete wavelet transform","doi":"10.1109/82.718811","startPage":"1031","endPage":"1043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.718811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15534","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/15534/00718811.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=718811","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/718811/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1998","displayDocTitle":"Scalable VLSI architectures for lattice structure-based discrete wavelet transform","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"45","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1998","accessionNumber":"6031524","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable VLSI architectures for lattice structure-based discrete wavelet transform","sourcePdf":"00718811.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073686S","chronDate":"Aug 1998","isNumber":"15534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"7","articleId":"718811","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":718812,"authors":[{"name":"K.

However, several studies have shown recently that taking the quantization noise into account in the design could yield noticeable reduction of the reconstruction distortion. In particular, a joint optimization of the synthesis filters and quantizers with respect to the output mean squared error (MSE) was proposed, and the resulting scheme was called an minimum MSE (MMSE) filter bank. However, this approach was dedicated to parallel uniform filter banks, which require a very large computational complexity. This paper is concerned with the possibility of providing MMSE filters under the constraint that the filter bank is either of a modulated or a tree-structured kind and thus of low implementation cost. Various approaches for the optimization of the synthesis bank are presented, taking into account the structural constraint. Depending on the number of parameters to be optimized, we obtain various tradeoffs between decoder complexity, transmitted bit rate, and reconstruction distortion.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/718812/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1998","volume":"45","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6031525","displayDocTitle":"MMSE design of modulated and tree-structured filter banks for efficient tradeoffs between rate, distortion, and decoder complexity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MMSE design of modulated and tree-structured filter banks for efficient tradeoffs between rate, distortion, and decoder complexity","sourcePdf":"00718812.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054939S","chronDate":"Aug 1998","isNumber":"15534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"3","articleId":"718812","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":718813,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Due to the increased computational complexity caused by oversampling, oversampled FBs allowing an efficient implementation, such as cosine modulated filter banks (CMFBs), are of particular interest. So far, only critically sampled CMFBs have been considered. In this paper, we introduce oversampled CMFBs with perfect reconstruction (PR). Extending a classification of CMFBs recently proposed by Gopinath, we consider two types of oversampled CMFBs with PR. One of these types allows linear phase filters in all channels, and comprises CMFBs recently introduced by Lin and Vaidyanathan as well as Wilson-type CMFBs. For both types of oversampled CMFBs, we formulate PR conditions in the time, frequency, and polyphase domains. It is shown that any PR CMFB corresponds to a PR DFT FB with twice the oversampling factor and that (under a specific condition) the same PR prototype can be used for both CMFB types. We also show that the frame-theoretic properties of a CMFB and of the corresponding DFT FB are closely related. In particular, it is demonstrated that the minimum-norm synthesis prototype in an oversampled PR CMFB equals that in the corresponding DFT FB. Finally, we briefly address design methods and the efficient DCT/DST-based implementation of oversampled CMFBs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/15534/00718813.pdf","startPage":"1057","endPage":"1071","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/82.718813","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.718813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15534","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=718813","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Oversampled cosine modulated filter banks with perfect reconstruction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel bank filters","Filter bank","Prototypes","Sampling methods","Nonlinear filters","Noise shaping","Computational complexity","Design methodology","Discrete cosine transforms","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital filters","FIR filters","discrete Fourier transforms","signal reconstruction","signal sampling","filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["oversampled cosine modulated filter banks","perfect reconstruction","efficient implementation","critically sampled","linear phase filters","Wilson-type","polyphase domain","time domain","frequency domain","frame-theoretic properties","DFT filter banks","minimum-norm synthesis prototype","design methods","paraunitarity conditions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/718813/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1998","displayDocTitle":"Oversampled cosine modulated filter banks with perfect reconstruction","volume":"45","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1998","accessionNumber":"6031526","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oversampled cosine modulated filter banks with perfect reconstruction","sourcePdf":"00718813.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065244S","chronDate":"Aug 1998","isNumber":"15534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"75","articleId":"718813","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":718819,"authors":[{"name":"P.C.

In order to solve this problem, the region-based wavelet transform (RWT) is proposed and its computational complexity is examined in this brief. It is shown that the RWT requires significantly fewer computations than conventional wavelet transform, since the RWT processes only the object region in the original image. Experimental results show that any arbitrarily shaped region in images can be decomposed using the RWT and perfectly reconstructed using the inverse RWT. Furthermore, the RWT outperforms the shape-adaptive wavelet transform (SAWT) in PSNR at the same compression ratio since the former generates less high-frequency information.","doi":"10.1109/82.718826","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/15534/00718826.pdf","startPage":"1137","endPage":"1140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.718826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15534","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Region-based wavelet transform for image compression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=718826","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/718826/","displayDocTitle":"Region-based wavelet transform for image compression","volume":"45","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1998","accessionNumber":"6038272","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Region-based wavelet transform for image compression","sourcePdf":"00718826.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041479S","chronDate":"Aug 1998","isNumber":"15534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"2","articleId":"718826","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":718830,"authors":[{"name":"K.W.

The approach is based on using a weighted-sum of near-adjacent IFT filters to realize the individual channel-bank filters, but with constraints added that results in significantly improved stopband performance while still achieving small reconstruction errors. The proposed channel banks are suitable for realizing multitone digital data communication systems, such as Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) systems, where stopband performance is critical. Under the conditions of maximal decimation, the reconstruction is not perfect, but aliasing errors are small enough to be negligible in practical communication systems. For some cases, the filter coefficients can be determined exactly without using optimization. Given the frequency-weighting coefficients reported herein, near-optimal multirate filter banks may be designed exactly without optimization for all even n.","doi":"10.1109/82.718830","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/15534/00718830.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.718830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15534","startPage":"1155","endPage":"1161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Small side-lobe filter design for multitone data-communication applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=718830","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Small side-lobe filter design for multitone data-communication applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/718830/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1998","accessionNumber":"6038275","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small side-lobe filter design for multitone data-communication applications","sourcePdf":"00718830.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02483S","chronDate":"Aug 1998","isNumber":"15534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"73","articleId":"718830","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":718832,"authors":[{"name":"C.

These data irregularities render many traditional signal processing techniques unusable, and thus the data must be interpolated onto an even grid before scientific analysis techniques can be applied. We propose a method to perform a reconstruction of nonuniformly sampled signals using a wavelet basis fit in a multiresolutional setting. The advantage of using a wavelet basis is that we are able to not only reconstruct the signal using global information, but we are also able to take advantage of locally dense areas of sampling to reconstruct at higher resolutions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiresolution analysis","Signal resolution","Discrete wavelet transforms","Signal processing","Signal sampling","Sampling methods","Wavelet analysis","Signal analysis","Nonuniform sampling","Signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal sampling","signal reconstruction","signal resolution","wavelet transforms","sampled data systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet basis reconstruction","nonuniformly sampled data","signal processing technique","multiresolutional setting","global information"]}],"doi":"10.1109/82.718832","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/15534/00718832.pdf","startPage":"1165","endPage":"1168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15534","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.718832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet basis reconstruction of nonuniformly sampled data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=718832","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet basis reconstruction of nonuniformly sampled data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/718832/","volume":"45","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1998","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6038277","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet basis reconstruction of nonuniformly sampled data","sourcePdf":"00718832.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035446S","chronDate":"Aug 1998","isNumber":"15534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"29","articleId":"718832","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":718847,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In Parts I and II of this article, the authors turn the attention to the modern Bayesian way of thinking and introduce a pragmatic approach to extract structural information from RS images by selecting from a library of a priori models those which best explain the structures within an image. Part I introduces the Bayesian approach and defines the information extraction as a two-level procedure: 1) model fitting, which is the incertitude alleviation over the model parameters, and 2) model selection, which is the incertitude alleviation over the class of models. The superiority of the Bayesian results is commented from an information theoretical perspective. The theoretical assay concludes with the proposal of a new systematic method for scene understanding from RS images: search for the scene that best explains the observed data. The method is demonstrated for high accuracy restoration of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images with emphasis on new optimization algorithms for simultaneous model selection and parameter estimation. Examples are given for three families of Gibbs random fields (GRF) used as prior model libraries. Based on the Bayesian approach, a new method for optimal joint scale and model selection is demonstrated. Examples are given using a nested family of GRFs utilized as prior models for information extraction with applications both to SAR and optical images.","doi":"10.1109/36.718847","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel4/36/15531/00718847.pdf","startPage":"1431","endPage":"1445","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.718847","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial information retrieval from remote-sensing images.

For the selection among several nested models and the fit of the model, the authors proceed in two steps of Bayesian inference. This procedure yields the most plausible model and its most likely parameters, which together describe the image content in an optimal way. Its additional application at multiple scales of the image enables the authors to capture all structures being present in complex remote-sensing images.

It emphasizes filtering noise adaptively according to the local noise level and filtering along fringes using directionally dependent windows. This algorithm is effective, especially for the tightly packed fringes of X-band interferometry. Using simulated and SIR-C/X-SAR repeat-pass generated interferograms, the effectiveness of this filter is demonstrated by its capabilities in residue reduction, adaptive noise filtering, and its ability to filter areas with high fringe rates.

A compromise, however, should be arranged on textured areas. In this work, a ratio Laplacian pyramid (RLP) is introduced to match the signal-dependent nature of speckle noise. Local statistics filtering is applied to the different spatial resolutions of the RLP of a speckled image. For natural scenes, each pyramid layer is characterized by an signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increasing as resolution decreases. Thus, each filter may be adjusted to achieve adaptivity also across scales. In addition, the estimation of the local statistics driving the filter is more accurate thanks to the multiresolution framework. A complete procedure is setup, and a general formulation, in which the variance of speckle is theoretically derived at each resolution, is developed. Experiments carried out on remotely sensed optical images corrupted with synthetic speckle, as well as on true SAR images, show the potentiality of the pyramid-based approach compared with other established despeckle algorithms, in terms both of SNR improvements and of enhancement in visual quality.","doi":"10.1109/36.718850","startPage":"1466","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel4/36/15531/00718850.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.718850","endPage":"1476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiresolution local-statistics speckle filtering based on a ratio Laplacian pyramid","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/718850/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","displayDocTitle":"Multiresolution local-statistics speckle filtering based on a ratio Laplacian pyramid","volume":"36","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6044010","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiresolution local-statistics speckle filtering based on a ratio Laplacian pyramid","sourcePdf":"00718850.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034542S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"60","articleId":"718850","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":718853,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

The manifestation of internal wave packets on SAR ocean images has always been of considerable interest to oceanographers. If, as seems likely, the gray tone patterns of these images can be confirmed to correspond to trough and crest patterns of internal waves, a great deal can be learned about internal waves from satellite data. The first problem in a mesoscale detection system is to distinguish sea from land in the SAR imagery. A method for coastline detection based on a sequence of basic processing procedures followed by a contour tracing algorithm is introduced to obtain sea-land separation to enhance the internal wave detection problem. The utility of wavelet analysis as a tool for automatic oceanic internal wave detection and orientation from SAR images is then examined using the two-dimensional (2D) wavelet transform based on the multiscale gradient detection method. The authors show that the evolution of local maxima of the wavelet transform across scales characterize the local shape of these quasilinear periodic structures. The results from this study, on several ERS-1 and RADARSAT SAR images, show that wavelet analysis is an excellent tool for detecting and locating internal wave features from satellite images against internal wave look-alikes.","doi":"10.1109/36.718853","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel4/36/15531/00718853.pdf","startPage":"1494","endPage":"1507","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.718853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Internal wave detection and location in SAR images using wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=718853","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/718853/","displayDocTitle":"Internal wave detection and location in SAR images using wavelet transform","volume":"36","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","accessionNumber":"6044013","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Internal wave detection and location in SAR images using wavelet transform","sourcePdf":"00718853.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060196S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"30","articleId":"718853","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":718854,"authors":[{"name":"S.K.T.

The coastal upwelling phenomenon is seen as an input-output system, built by the dependence between local wind events as input and upwelling, quantified by the SST index as output. To gain a priori knowledge about the input-output system, it is studied from a theoretical point of view with coastal upwelling simulations, which are performed with a three-dimensional (3D) ocean circulation model on artificial wind data. The dynamics observed in these studies are found to be bounded and dependent on previous states as well as nonlinear, which motivates the application of artificial neural network (ANN) techniques as a nonlinear modeling technique. To cope with this type of system and with the nonstationarity of the parameters used, a mixture of neural networks is applied for system analysis and prediction. The output space of the system is segmented in an unsupervised manner, while the modular neural networks are specializing on one segment each. It is shown that different dynamic structures in the input-output system are detected by the mixture approach and prediction is improved. The synergetic approach presented, using numerical models to gain a priori knowledge for the choice and design of a neural prediction tool, is appealing for implementing simulations or modeling into an operational application, for instance, geographical information systems (GISs) or decision support systems (DSSs).","doi":"10.1109/36.718854","pdfPath":"/iel4/36/15531/00718854.pdf","startPage":"1508","endPage":"1518","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.718854","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coastal upwelling prediction with a mixture of neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/718854/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","displayDocTitle":"Coastal upwelling prediction with a mixture of neural networks","volume":"36","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6044014","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coastal upwelling prediction with a mixture of neural networks","sourcePdf":"00718854.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08468S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"8","articleId":"718854","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":718856,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It is necessarily iterative in an attempt to converge on a dominant target against clutter interference, while sufficiently capturing the blur function. The authors propose to speed the estimation convergence by selectively increasing the pool of quality synchronization sources and not be limited by the range pixels of the SAR map. This is highly probable since each range bin contains more than one prominent scatterer across the integration aperture. It is also highly probable that the least-brightest selected scatterer in a range gate may turn out to be of higher energy as compared to the maximum brightest scatterer of another gate. With appropriate target filtering to final select the quality scatterers out of the large pool and with higher order phase error measurement tool, the new algorithm achieves near-convergence focusing quality without iteration.

In this paper, the effects of misregistration on the accuracy of remotely sensed change detection were systematically investigated and quantitatively evaluated. This simulation research focused on two interconnected components. In the first component, the statistical properties of the multispectral difference images were evaluated using semivariograms when multitemporal images were progressively misregistered against themselves and each other to investigate the band, temporal, and spatial frequency sensitivities of change detection to image misregistration. In the second component, the ellipsoidal change detection technique, based on the Mahalanobis distance of multispectral difference images, was proposed and used to progressively detect the land cover transitions at each misregistration stage for each pair of multitemporal images. The impact of misregistration on change detection was then evaluated in terms of the accuracy of change detection using the output from the ellipsoidal change detector. The experimental results using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery are presented. It is interesting to notice that, among the seven TM bands, band 4 (near-infrared channel) is the most sensitive to misregistration when change detection is concerned.

Following delay compensation, height estimates are sorted by Doppler frequency, and integrated in parallel. More equivalent looks are accumulated than in a conventional altimeter. The relatively small along-track footprint size is a constant of the system, typically on the order of 250 m for a Ku-band altimeter. The flat-surface response is an impulse rather than the more familiar step function produced by conventional satellite radar altimeters. The radar equation for the delay/Doppler radar altimeter has an h/sup -5/2/(CT)/sup 1/2/ dependence on height h and compressed pulse length /spl tau/, which is more efficient than the corresponding h/sup 3/CT factor for a pulse-limited altimeter. The radiometric response obtained by the new approach would be 10 dB stronger than that of the TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter, for example, if the same hardware were used in the delay/Doppler altimeter mode. This new technique leads to a smaller instrument that requires less power, yet performs better than a conventional radar altimeter. The concept represents a new generation of altimeter for Earth observation, with particular suitability for coastal ocean regions and polar ice sheets as well as open oceans.","doi":"10.1109/36.718861","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel4/36/15531/00718861.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15531","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.718861","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","startPage":"1578","endPage":"1588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The delay/Doppler radar altimeter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=718861","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","displayDocTitle":"The delay/Doppler radar altimeter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/718861/","volume":"36","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","accessionNumber":"6044019","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The delay/Doppler radar altimeter","sourcePdf":"00718861.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028864S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"270","articleId":"718861","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":719238,"authors":[{"name":"Tsung-Yi Yang","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK"],"lastName":"Tsung-Yi Yang","id":"37335331600"},{"name":"J.

Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers are almost ideal in their characteristics, but they are not quite perfect, and they give rise to effects such as amplifier noise, amplifier spectral gain nonuniformity, and channel cross saturation which do limit the performance of optically amplified transmission systems and networks. Transmission impairments, such as those from optical nonlinearities, dispersion and polarization effects accumulate in amplified systems and have greater impact. The optical signal-to-noise ratio of the system can be improved by decreasing the noise figure of the EDFAs, increasing the channel powers, lowering repeater spacing and/or lowering system reach. Low noise figure and high output power can be achieved simultaneously with two-stage EDFA designs.","doi":"10.1109/OFC.1997.719712","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OFC.1997.719712","startPage":"81","endPage":"82","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Optical Fiber Communication Conference (","pdfPath":"/iel4/4422/12558/00719712.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Optical Fiber Communication Conference (","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12558","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance issues in optically amplified systems and networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-21 Feb 1997","displayDocTitle":"Performance issues in optically amplified systems and networks","conferenceDate":"16-21 Feb. 1997","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5926603","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/719712/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance issues in optically amplified systems and networks","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00719712.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030044S","chronDate":"16-21 Feb 1997","isNumber":"12558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422","citationCount":"1","articleId":"719712","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":719715,"authors":[{"name":"J.L.

All-optical feedback can stabilize EDFA gain independent of total input power, but this technique has been applied to only a limited extent when more than one channel is present. Additionally, published reports have not addressed all-optical stabilization of amplifier chains. Even when the first amplifier is gain stabilized, the number of channels in the subsequent amplifiers changes and thus each amplifier must in turn be stabilized. We show here the output power in a given wavelength channel can be stabilized when only the first amplifier of the chain is modified. This is accomplished by generating a compensating signal in the first amplifier, using all-optical feedback, and then propagating the compensating signal along the entire chain.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Erbium-doped fiber amplifier","Optical amplifiers","Power amplifiers","Power generation","Feedback loop","Optical feedback","Output feedback","Attenuators","Optical propagation","Optical coupling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fibre lasers","laser feedback","optical communication equipment","wavelength division multiplexing","optical fibre networks","gain control","erbium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Er-doped fiber amplifiers","cascaded multichannel","changing numbers of channels","all-optical stabilization","all-optical feedback","compensating signal","gain stabilization","amplifier chains","wavelength-selective feedback loop","constant-gain amplifier"]}],"doi":"10.1109/OFC.1997.719715","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Optical Fiber Communication Conference (","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Optical Fiber Communication Conference (","pdfPath":"/iel4/4422/12558/00719715.pdf","startPage":"84","endPage":"85","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OFC.1997.719715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"All-optical stabilization of cascaded multichannel erbium-doped fiber amplifiers with changing numbers of channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=719715","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"All-optical stabilization of cascaded multichannel erbium-doped fiber amplifiers with changing numbers of channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/719715/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5926606","conferenceDate":"16-21 Feb. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-21 Feb 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"All-optical stabilization of cascaded multichannel erbium-doped fiber amplifiers with changing numbers of channels","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00719715.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043409S","chronDate":"16-21 Feb 1997","isNumber":"12558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422","citationCount":"8","articleId":"719715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":719719,"authors":[{"name":"J.D.

Recently a novel fiber-optic link architecture has been proposed, where the baseband data is up converted by an external modulator, transmitted through a fiber link, and mixed down to IF by another external modulator at the receiving end. Such a scheme offers the advantage of the infinite RF isolation and also avoids the need for high-speed photodetectors and microwave mixers. However, it also has several problems, specifically at the receiving end. First, an external modulator is intrinsically polarization sensitive, and the optical links already laid out are not polarization maintained. Secondly, the external modulator has additional loss of /spl sim/5 dB, potentially requiring optical amplification. In this paper, we propose a novel microwave mixer for photonic microwave systems based on cross-gain saturation in a semiconductor optical amplifier. In the experimental demonstration, an optical signal at 1312 nm carrying a 6-GHz RF signal is down and up converted to 1 GHz and 11 GHz by another optical signal at 1320 nm carrying a 5-GHz local oscillator. A lossless up/down conversion operation is also achieved. Such a mixer offers the advantage of polarization independence and optical amplification.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OFC.1997.719874","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Optical Fiber Communication Conference (","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Optical Fiber Communication Conference (","pdfPath":"/iel4/4422/12558/00719874.pdf","startPage":"263","endPage":"264","doi":"10.1109/OFC.1997.719874","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An all-optical microwave mixer with gain [using semiconductor optical amplifier]","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-21 Feb 1997","displayDocTitle":"An all-optical microwave mixer with gain [using semiconductor optical amplifier]","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-21 Feb. 1997","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5958751","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/719874/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An all-optical microwave mixer with gain [using semiconductor optical amplifier]","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00719874.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04237S","chronDate":"16-21 Feb 1997","isNumber":"12558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422","citationCount":"8","articleId":"719874","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":719879,"authors":[{"name":"T.

An effective way to avoid this distortion is the use of an optical duobinary signal, which has only half the spectrum bandwidth of a conventional intensity modulation (IM) signal. For generating optical duobinary signals, two types of modulation schemes are well known; a low-pass filtering (LPF) method and an electrical one-bit delay method. From computer simulation results for both modulation schemes, we have found that the LPF method shows larger suppression for the optical spectrum side-lobes and has more tolerance against the fiber dispersion than the one-bit delay method. Therefore, we employed the LPF method to evaluate dispersion tolerance of the optical duobinary signal. By using a newly developed, high-speed optical duobinary transmitter and receiver, more than 40-km standard fiber [1.3-/spl mu/m zero-dispersion single-mode fiber] transmissions have been demonstrated at 20 Gbit/s. The result indicates the robustness of optical duobinary signals against dispersion in high-capacity, long-distance transmission.","doi":"10.1109/OFC.1997.719879","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Optical Fiber Communication Conference (","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Optical Fiber Communication Conference (","pdfPath":"/iel4/4422/12558/00719879.pdf","startPage":"268","endPage":"269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OFC.1997.719879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12558","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=719879","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Demonstration of high-dispersion tolerance of 20-Gbit/s optical duobinary signal generated by a low-pass filtering method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Demonstration of high-dispersion tolerance of 20-Gbit/s optical duobinary signal generated by a low-pass filtering method","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/719879/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-21 Feb 1997","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5958756","conferenceDate":"16-21 Feb. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demonstration of high-dispersion tolerance of 20-Gbit/s optical duobinary signal generated by a low-pass filtering method","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00719879.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029783S","chronDate":"16-21 Feb 1997","isNumber":"12558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422","citationCount":"10","articleId":"719879","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":719894,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This resonator is adaptable, robust, potentially cost efficient and readily compatible with the fiber network.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OFC.1997.719894","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Optical Fiber Communication Conference (","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Optical Fiber Communication Conference (","pdfPath":"/iel4/4422/12558/00719894.pdf","startPage":"284","endPage":"285","doi":"10.1109/OFC.1997.719894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of a sampled Bragg grating as an in-fiber optical resonator for the realization of a referencing optical frequency scale for WDM communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-21 Feb 1997","displayDocTitle":"Use of a sampled Bragg grating as an in-fiber optical resonator for the realization of a referencing optical frequency scale for WDM communications","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-21 Feb. 1997","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5965208","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/719894/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of a sampled Bragg grating as an in-fiber optical resonator for the realization of a referencing optical frequency scale for WDM communications","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00719894.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033341S","chronDate":"16-21 Feb 1997","isNumber":"12558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422","citationCount":"6","articleId":"719894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":719902,"authors":[{"name":"D.K.

Large (AM-VSB) channel-count, high-power downstream optical fiber transmitters have been commercialized for a few years, and the fundamental capacity of a downstream DFB laser has also been extensively studied. As for the upstream links, future interactive applications such as Internet access and cable telephony will require return-channel lasers transport multiple channels of QPSK or 16-QAM channels. This interactive traffic may keep on growing, and it may become more economical to frequency-division-multiplex several return-channel bands (each occupying the conventional 5-40 MHz) before modulating a return-channel laser diode. By using this frequency-stacking technique, fewer return-channel lasers and up-link optical fibers can be used. However, until now, it is unclear what the ultimate bursty QPSK/16-QAM channel capacity of an uncooled/unisolated Fabry-Perot or DFB laser is, and how much clipping-induced nonlinear distortion due to multiple collided medium-access control channels a return-channel laser can tolerate. In this paper, we provide experimental, computer simulation, and analytical results to answer these questions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultimate capacity of a return-channel laser diode in transporting multichannel bursty QPSK/16-QAM signals","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Optical Fiber Communication Conference (","doi":"10.1109/OFC.1997.719926","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Optical Fiber Communication Conference (","pdfPath":"/iel4/4422/12558/00719926.pdf","startPage":"318","endPage":"320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OFC.1997.719926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12558","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=719926","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/719926/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-21 Feb 1997","displayDocTitle":"Ultimate capacity of a return-channel laser diode in transporting multichannel bursty QPSK/16-QAM signals","conferenceDate":"16-21 Feb. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5971775","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultimate capacity of a return-channel laser diode in transporting multichannel bursty QPSK/16-QAM signals","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00719926.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046986S","chronDate":"16-21 Feb 1997","isNumber":"12558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422","citationCount":"2","articleId":"719926","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":719928,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A dual-frequency (C- and X-band), dual-linear polarized SAR array antenna prototype was designed, fabricated, and tested. The principal goal of this effort was to demonstrate the viability of the dual-band dual-polarized array concept, and this has been accomplished. Test results are shown with good correlation between measured and predicted results, validating the design approach used.

Narrow-band propagation characteristics is shown in the spatial domain and wide-band propagation in the time domain. In empty straight-tunnel environments, propagation exhibits a break-point phenomenon and has very short time delay spread. In empty curved or branched tunnel environments, propagation suffers higher loss. Vehicles cause additional propagation loss and larger varying time delay spread in tunnels. The measured results have validated the accuracy of the theoretical model and provided important information on narrow-band and wide-band propagation characteristics in empty, branched and obstructed tunnels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/719977/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","volume":"46","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","accessionNumber":"6050294","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Ray-optical prediction of radio-wave propagation characteristics in tunnel environments. 2.

In this technique, the MoM with an approximate Green's function is used to characterize the small protrusions, yielding an admittance matrix, which, when multiplied with the incident field on the protrusions, yields the currents induced on the protrusions. The incident field in the presence of the large bodies is calculated using the SBR method. The field radiated by the currents on the protrusions is also calculated using the SBR method with the aid of reciprocity. Furthermore, an iterative approach is developed, which can reduce the error introduced by the use of the approximate Green's function, Numerical results are given to demonstrate the accuracy and capability of the hybrid technique.","doi":"10.1109/8.719979","startPage":"1349","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/15545/00719979.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.719979","endPage":"1357","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15545","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid SBR/MoM technique for analysis of scattering from small protrusions on a large conducting body","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/719979/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid SBR/MoM technique for analysis of scattering from small protrusions on a large conducting body","volume":"46","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6050295","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid SBR/MoM technique for analysis of scattering from small protrusions on a large conducting body","sourcePdf":"00719979.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044933S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"21","articleId":"719979","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":719984,"authors":[{"name":"F.L.
