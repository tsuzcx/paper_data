It consists of applying the wavelet transform (WT) technique to the detection of atrial flutter waves in the inferior lead Y of the Frank orthogonal EGG. The algorithm was developed and tested on a learning group of 325 cases with 47% having AF. Its clinical usefulness was prospectively assessed on a testing group of 1344 patients with 1.8% having AF. The sensitivity in this testing group was 44% It was raised to 80% by including the diagnostic statement of \"possible AF\", but at the same time the positive predictive value decreased from 84.6% to 66%. However, the specificity remained quite high: 99.2%. This WT procedure allowed the authors to improve the performance of the automated diagnosis of AF as compared with their previous experience.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CIC.1994.470071","publicationTitle":"Computers in Cardiology 1994","displayPublicationTitle":"Computers in Cardiology 1994","pdfPath":"/iel2/3299/9921/00470071.pdf","startPage":"773","endPage":"776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIC.1994.470071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated ECG diagnosis of atrial flutter by means of wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=470071","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/470071/","displayDocTitle":"Automated ECG diagnosis of atrial flutter by means of wavelet transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5050694","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated ECG diagnosis of atrial flutter by means of wavelet transform","confLoc":"Bethesda, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00470071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068237S","chronDate":"25-28 Sep 1994","isNumber":"9921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3299","citationCount":"2","articleId":"470071","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":470100,"authors":[{"name":"P.

To determine whether TFA might improve the accuracy of automated intraventricular signal classification, the authors examined ten patients, each with ten cycles of sinus rhythm (SR) and ten cycles of ventricular tachycardia (VT). A time-frequency distribution (tfd) and a four line contour plot (CP) were generated for each cycle. A three layer backpropagation neural network (NN) was constructed in which three features were extracted from each CP cycle and used as inputs to the discriminant NN. One-half of the SR and VT cycles were utilized as a training set. Each patient-specific NN and a generalized NN bad an overall correct detection probability greater than 0.7. Using a NN as a classifier, time-frequency analysis improved specificity in arrhythmia classification without sacrificing sensitivity. It is concluded that combined neural network and TFA shows promise for automated intracardiac signal classification.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CIC.1994.470148","pdfPath":"/iel2/3299/9921/00470148.pdf","startPage":"449","endPage":"452","displayPublicationTitle":"Computers in Cardiology 1994","publicationTitle":"Computers in Cardiology 1994","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIC.1994.470148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intracardiac arrhythmia classification using neural network and time-frequency analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/470148/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 1994","displayDocTitle":"Intracardiac arrhythmia classification using neural network and time-frequency analysis","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5038847","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intracardiac arrhythmia classification using neural network and time-frequency analysis","confLoc":"Bethesda, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00470148.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042206S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 1994","isNumber":"9921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3299","citationCount":"2","articleId":"470148","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":470325,"authors":[{"name":"M.B.

Recent research activities follow the goal, to integrate these tools in a unified framework, which enables concurrent engineering based on a controlled execution of design activities within a common environment. Today, framework services are typically restricted to design data management and integration facilities. This paper addresses the often neglected, but very important problem of design flow management with special emphasis on project management strategies. In contrast to other approaches a generic procedure is proposed which is driven by the inherent interdependencies between project specification, design team and tools.

The proposed methodology uses a pseudo-exhaustive technique based on Reed-Solomon codes, which can be efficiently applied to a word-oriented RAMs, assuming small values of k. The methodology ensures the detection of any number of disjoint (not linked) k-coupling faults, whereby the involved k words may be located anywhere in the memory; i.e., no assumptions have to be made on the physical topology of the cells in the memory cell array because of the systematic structure of the proposed tests, they are well suited for BIST implementations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pseudo-exhaustive word-oriented DRAM testing","doi":"10.1109/EDTC.1995.470409","startPage":"126","endPage":"132","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDTC.1995.470409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9922","publicationTitle":"Proceedings the European Design and Test Conference.

In seeking a more unified perspective, we propose a new sum of densities measure for multi-way circuit decomposition, where the density of a subhypergraph is the ratio of the number of edges to the number of nodes in the subhypergraph. Finding a k-way partition that maximizes the sum of k subhypergraph densities is NP-hard, but an efficient flow-based method can find the optimal (maximum-density) subhypergraph in a given hypergraph. Based on this method, we develop a heuristic which in practice has less than 10% error from an optimal sum of densities decomposition. Other results suggest that density-based heuristics can capture cut-based objectives, whereas the converse would seem difficult.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/EDTC.1995.470419","publicationTitle":"Proceedings the European Design and Test Conference.

To address this need, we analyze the potential for document caching at the application level in document transfer services. We have collected traces of actual executions of Mosaic, reflecting over half a million user requests for WWW documents. Using those traces, we study the tradeoffs between caching at three levels in the system, and the potential for use of application-level information in the caching system. Our traces show that while a high hit rate in terms of URLs is achievable, a much lower hit rate is possible in terms of bytes, because most profitably-cached documents are small. We consider the performance of caching when applied at the level of individual user sessions, at the level of individual hosts, and at the level of a collection of hosts on a single LAN. We show that the performance gain achievable by caching at the session level (which is straightforward to implement) is nearly all of that achievable at the LAN level (where caching is more difficult to implement). However, when resource requirements are considered, LAN level caching becomes muck more desirable, since it can achieve a given level of caching performance using a much smaller amount of cache space. Finally, we consider the use of organizational boundary information as an example of the potential for use of application-level information in caching. Our results suggest that distinguishing between documents produced locally and those produced remotely can provide useful leverage in designing caching policies, because of differences in the potential for sharing these two document types among multiple users.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Second International Workshop on Services in Distributed and Networked Environments","pdfPath":"/iel2/3301/9923/00470449.pdf","startPage":"166","endPage":"173","publicationTitle":"Second International Workshop on Services in Distributed and Networked Environments","doi":"10.1109/SDNE.1995.470449","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SDNE.1995.470449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9923","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=470449","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application-level document caching in the Internet","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Internet","Delay","Network servers","Local area networks","Web server","Web sites","World Wide Web","Bandwidth","File systems","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","information services","wide area networks","cache storage","document handling","local area networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","application-level document caching","document transfer services","World Wide Web","resource management","latency reduction","Mosaic execution traces","user requests","hit rate","profitably-cached documents","caching performance","individual user sessions","individual hosts","host collection","single LAN","organizational boundary information","locally produced documents","remotely produced documents","caching policy design","document sharing","multiple users"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/470449/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Application-level document caching in the Internet","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"4986996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-6 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application-level document caching in the Internet","confLoc":"Whistler, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00470449.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055232S","chronDate":"5-6 Jun 1995","isNumber":"9923","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3301","citationCount":"70","articleId":"470449","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":470459,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Very-low-voltage testing also detects pattern dependent faults caused by resistive shorts. Because of its simplicity and because there is no overhead associated with it, very-low-voltage testing can easily be applied to chips and circuit boards as a production test, field test, or failure diagnosis technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TEST.1993.470686","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Test Conference - (ITC)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Test Conference - (ITC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3304/9926/00470686.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.1993.470686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9926","startPage":"275","endPage":"284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Very-low-voltage testing for weak CMOS logic ICs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=470686","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Very-low-voltage testing for weak CMOS logic ICs","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-21 Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/470686/","conferenceDate":"17-21 Oct. 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4985270","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Very-low-voltage testing for weak CMOS logic ICs","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00470686.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058795S","chronDate":"17-21 Oct 1993","isNumber":"9926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3304","citationCount":"117","articleId":"470686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":470715,"authors":[{"name":"H.T.

Tuning range, output power, and phase noise have been characterized for the HBT VCOs, while conversion loss and noise figure were measured for the Schottky diode mixers. The VCO shows 10-dB better phase noise performance over a similar design based on a GaAs HBT process. Measured at very low IF, the InP-based Schottky diode mixer demonstrates more than 1 dB noise figure improvement over the same design based on GaAs Schottky process. The InP mixer also requires a very low LO power at only 1 dBm for a 8-dB conversion loss.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MCS.1995.470981","publicationTitle":"IEEE 1995 Microwave and Millimeter-Wave.

The complexity of the subject is compounded by the fact that the RF power transistor acts as a high-resistance current source or as a low-resistance switch, or - in some amplifiers - as a high-resistance current source during part of the\" on\" interval and as a low-resistance switch during another part of the\" on\" interval (mixed-mode operation). Inspection of the circuit topology is not sufficient to define unambiguously the transistor operating mode or the amplifier class of operation.

Dynamic instrumentation lets us defer insertion until the moment it is needed (and remove it when it is no longer needed); Paradyn's Performance Consultant decides when and where to insert instrumentation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/2.471178","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","startPage":"37","endPage":"46","publicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel4/2/9933/00471178.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2.471178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Paradyn parallel performance measurement tool","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Instruments","Aerodynamics","Programming profession","Large-scale systems","Automatic control","Scalability","High level languages","Parallel machines","Debugging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software performance evaluation","software tools","parallel programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Paradyn parallel performance measurement tool","large-scale parallel program","flexible performance information","automatic instrumentation control","dynamic instrumentation","insertion","Performance Consultant"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1995","displayDocTitle":"The Paradyn parallel performance measurement tool","volume":"28","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5121028","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/471178/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Paradyn parallel performance measurement tool","sourcePdf":"471178.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052851S","chronDate":"Nov 1995","isNumber":"9933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"456","articleId":"471178","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":471181,"authors":[{"name":"T.T.

Backfiring is the direct mathematical conversion of LOC data into equivalent function-point data. Because the backfiring equations are bidirectional, they also provide a powerful way of sizing, or predicting, source-code volume for any known programming language or combination of languages. The function-point metric, invented by A.J. Albrecht of IBM in the middle 1970s, is a synthetic metric derived by a weighted formula that includes five elements: inputs, outputs, logical files, inquiries, and interfaces. IBM put it into the public domain in 1979, and its use spread rapidly, particularly after the formation of the International Function Point Users Group (IFPUG) in the mid-1980s. By then, hundreds of software projects had been measured using both function points and lines of source code. Since an application's function-point total is independent of the source code, this dual analysis has led to several important discoveries.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/471193/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1995","volume":"28","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","accessionNumber":"5121033","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Backfiring: converting lines of code to function points","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Backfiring: converting lines of code to function points","sourcePdf":"471193.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025451S","chronDate":"Nov 1995","isNumber":"9933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"12","articleId":"471193","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":471210,"authors":[{"name":"J.G.

One-cycle control rejects power source perturbations in one switching cycle; the average value of the switched variable follows the dynamic reference in one switching cycle; and the controller corrects switching errors in one switching cycle. There is no steady-state error nor dynamic error between the control reference and the average value of the switched variable. Experiments with a constant frequency buck converter have demonstrated the robustness of the control method and verified the theoretical predictions. This new control method is very general and applicable to all types of pulse-width-modulated, resonant-based, or soft-switched switching converters for either voltage or current control in continuous or discontinuous conduction mode. Furthermore, it can be used to control any physical variable or abstract signal that is in the form of a switched variable or can be converted to the form of a switched variable.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/471281/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1995","volume":"10","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","accessionNumber":"5122726","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"One-cycle control of switching converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"One-cycle control of switching converters","sourcePdf":"00471281.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036436S","chronDate":"Nov.  1995","isNumber":"9936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"265","articleId":"471281","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":471282,"authors":[{"name":"K.M.

We also discuss numerical (Monte Carlo) verification issues for power spectral formulas. A general spectral formula for stationary randomized modulation schemes is presented, and specialized to several modulation schemes of practical interest for DC/DC converters. Analytical results are then given for block-stationary randomized modulation schemes that are suitable for inverter operation. In the process, we present results for several modulation schemes that have been reported in the literature without analytical explanations. Experimental verifications of some of our analytical results are presented. We formulate narrow-band and wide-band synthesis problems in randomized modulation, and solve them numerically.

In this control strategy the state variables of the LC filter connected to the AC side of the converter are fed back to the PWM pattern generator, thereby eliminating a DC offset of the AC input currents as well as oscillations of the DC output current during transients. Computer simulation of the converter system with the proposed control strategy shows that the transient waveforms of AC input and DC output currents are improved greatly even if the damping effect of the AC side resistance can not be expected. The DC voltage regulation with good dynamic response is also achieved even if DC capacitance is substantially reduced. Experimental results from a low power laboratory model are also included to confirm the simulated results and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/63.471291","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/9936/00471291.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.471291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9936","startPage":"716","endPage":"724","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new state feedback based transient control of PWM AC to DC voltage type converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=471291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new state feedback based transient control of PWM AC to DC voltage type converters","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/471291/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","accessionNumber":"5122736","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new state feedback based transient control of PWM AC to DC voltage type converters","sourcePdf":"00471291.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053135S","chronDate":"Nov.  1995","isNumber":"9936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"61","articleId":"471291","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":471292,"authors":[{"name":"L.J.

It is the direct torque control method in which the applied output voltage is calculated from the reference torque and the torque of the previous step in the two-phase conducting period and in the commutation period considering the back EMF waveform. The time delay due to the calculation is compensated by the one step ahead current prediction. To measure the instantaneous torque ripple, a torque observer is constructed using a high precision encoder of 50000 pulse per revolution.

This is the first result on the hardness of loading a simple three-node architecture which does not consist of the binary-threshold neurons, but rather utilizes a particular continuous activation function, commonly used in the neural-network literature. The authors observe that the loading problem is polynomial-time if the input dimension is constant. Otherwise, however, any possible learning algorithm based on particular fixed architectures faces severe computational barriers. Similar theorems have already been proved by Megiddo and by Blum and Rivest, to the case of binary-threshold networks only. The authors' theoretical results lend further suggestion to the use of incremental (architecture-changing) techniques for training networks rather than fixed architectures. Furthermore, they imply hardness of learnability in the probably approximately correct sense as well.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.471360","startPage":"1490","endPage":"1504","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.471360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9939","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/9939/00471360.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the complexity of training neural networks with continuous activation functions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/471360/","displayDocTitle":"On the complexity of training neural networks with continuous activation functions","volume":"6","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5110568","pubMedId":"18263442","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the complexity of training neural networks with continuous activation functions","sourcePdf":"00471360.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070984S","chronDate":"Nov.  1995","isNumber":"9939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"22","articleId":"471360","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":471364,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Its performance in terms of percentage of local minima, learning speed, and generalization ability is evaluated and found superior to the performance of the backpropagation algorithm and variants thereof taking especially into account the statistical significance of the results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.471365","startPage":"1420","endPage":"1434","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.471365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9939","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/9939/00471365.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient constrained training algorithm for feedforward networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/471365/","displayDocTitle":"An efficient constrained training algorithm for feedforward networks","volume":"6","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5110563","pubMedId":"18263435","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient constrained training algorithm for feedforward networks","sourcePdf":"00471365.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061661S","chronDate":"Nov.  1995","isNumber":"9939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"58","articleId":"471365","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":471366,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Yuan","affiliation":["Dept. of Mech.

This paper presents a collision-identification neural network (CINN) to identify possible collisions between two convex polyhedra. It consists of a modified Hamming net and a constraint subnet. The modified Hamming net is designed for point-to-polyhedron collision identification, and the constraint subnet is designed to move a point within a polyhedron and detect possible collisions with another polyhedron. A CINN has a simple canonical structure. It is very easy to program and can be implemented by a modest number of nonlinear amplifiers and three analog integrators. The working principle of the CINN is very similar to the well-known Hopfield net model. Its simple collective computing power accomplishes the relatively complicated task of collision identification between convex polyhedra, rendering a suitable device for online path planning of robots. An example is presented to demonstrate the application of CINN's to collision-free motion planning.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.471366","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/9939/00471366.pdf","startPage":"1411","endPage":"1419","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.471366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9939","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Collision identification between convex polyhedra using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/471366/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Collision identification between convex polyhedra using neural networks","volume":"6","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5110562","pubMedId":"18263434","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collision identification between convex polyhedra using neural networks","sourcePdf":"00471366.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075563S","chronDate":"Nov.  1995","isNumber":"9939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"1","articleId":"471366","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":471367,"authors":[{"name":"Le Nguyen Binh","affiliation":["Applied Photonics and Optical Communications Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"lastName":"Le Nguyen Binh","id":"37087253272"},{"name":"Hock Choong Chong","affiliation":["Applied Photonics and Optical Communications Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"lastName":"Hock Choong Chong","id":"37088245608"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"471367","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=471367","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Packet switching","Neural networks","Communication switching","Optical packet switching","Optical switches","Throughput","Computer networks","Switching circuits","Computational modeling","Optical fiber communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet switching","telecommunication networks","neural nets","integrated optoelectronics","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network contention controller","packet switching networks","output contention","synchronous switching mode","K-winner-take-all neural-network technique","speedup factor","real-time computation","nonblocking switching high-speed high-capacity packet switch","packet loss","frozen state","optoelectronic contention controller"]}],"doi":"10.1109/72.471367","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/9939/00471367.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","startPage":"1402","endPage":"1410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9939","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.471367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural-network contention controller for packet switching networks","abstract":"A novel approach to solving the output contention in packet switching networks with synchronous switching mode is presented.

The approach consists of two phases: (1) matching between every two consecutive frames and (2) estimating motion parameters based on the correspondences established. Phase 1 specifies the matching constraints to ensure a stable and coherent feature correspondence establishment between two sequential time frames and configures a 2D Hopfield neural net to enforce these constraints. Phase 2 constructs a 3-layer net to estimate parameters through supervised learning. The method performs motion analysis based on sequential multiple time frames. It represents an effective way to achieve optimal matching between two frames using neural net techniques. The energy function of the Hopfield net is designed to reflect the matching constraints and the minimization of this function leads to the optimal feature correspondence establishment. The approach introduces the learning concept to motion estimation. The structure of the net provides the flexibility in estimating motion parameters based on information from multiple frames.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/471369/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5110559","pubMedId":"18263431","volume":"6","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural networks for 3-D motion analysis.

In the incremental communication method, instead of communicating the whole value of a variable, only the increment or decrement of its previous value is sent on a communication link. The incremental value may be either a fixed-point or a floating-point value. Multilayer feedforward network architecture is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed communication scheme. The method is applied to three different learning problems and the effect of the precision of incremental input-output values of the neurons on the convergence behavior is examined. It is shown through simulation that for some problems even four-bit precision in fixed- and/or floating-point representations is sufficient for the network to converge. With 8-12 bit precisions almost the same results are obtained as that with the conventional communication using 32-bit precision. The proposed method of communication can lead to significant savings in the intercommunication cost for implementations of artificial neural networks on parallel computers as well as the interconnection cost of direct hardware realizations. The method can be incorporated into most of the current learning algorithms in which inter-neuron communications are required. Moreover, it can be used along with the other limited precision strategies for representation of variables suggested in literature.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.471370","startPage":"1375","endPage":"1385","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.471370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9939","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/9939/00471370.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incremental communication for multilayer neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/471370/","displayDocTitle":"Incremental communication for multilayer neural networks","volume":"6","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5110558","pubMedId":"18263430","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incremental communication for multilayer neural networks","sourcePdf":"00471370.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040687S","chronDate":"Nov.  1995","isNumber":"9939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"10","articleId":"471370","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":471372,"authors":[{"name":"M.

An ART2 (adaptive resonance theory) network was employed in this self-organizing neural-network system. The system consists of a preprocessor, an ART2, network, and a recognizer. The preprocessor detects R points in the ECG and divides the ECG into cardiac cycles. A QRS-wave is the part of the ECG that is between a Q point and an S point. The input to the ART2 network is one cardiac cycle from which the ART2 network indicates the approximate locations of both the Q and S points. The recognizer establishes search regions for the Q and S points. Then, it locates the Q and S points in each search region. The system uses this method to recognize a QRS-wave. Then, the ART2 network learns the new QRS-wave pattern from the incoming ECG. The ART2 network self-organizes in response to the input ECG. The average recognition error of the present system is less than 1 ms in the recognition of the Q and S points.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.471381","startPage":"1469","endPage":"1477","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.471381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9939","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/9939/00471381.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-organizing QRS-wave recognition in ECG using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/471381/","displayDocTitle":"Self-organizing QRS-wave recognition in ECG using neural networks","volume":"6","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5116973","pubMedId":"18263440","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-organizing QRS-wave recognition in ECG using neural networks","sourcePdf":"00471381.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048715S","chronDate":"Nov.  1995","isNumber":"9939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"48","articleId":"471381","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":471391,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The resulting errors limit the accuracy of ADPLL-based frequency demodulation and usually make ADPLL-based phase demodulation impractical because of severe phase-drift problems. This paper presents a new class of ADPLL's that are insensitive to the deleterious effects of quantization, and do not exhibit nonlinear behavior when implemented with practical DCO's. The ADPLL's are well suited to applications requiring precise frequency demodulation, and can also be used for phase demodulation because their quantization error is well behaved even after discrete-time integration. The paper establishes an analogy between the ADPLL's and delta-sigma modulators, and applies existing delta-sigma modulator results to predict the frequency and phase demodulation accuracy of the ADPLL's. A mechanization of the general architecture consisting of easily implemented components such as analog integrators, digital flip-flops, and digital counters is then presented and analyzed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/82.471391","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/9940/00471391.pdf","startPage":"621","endPage":"630","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.471391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9940","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog-input digital phase-locked loops for precise frequency and phase demodulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=471391","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/471391/","displayDocTitle":"Analog-input digital phase-locked loops for precise frequency and phase demodulation","volume":"42","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5110837","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog-input digital phase-locked loops for precise frequency and phase demodulation","sourcePdf":"00471391.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03366S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"29","articleId":"471391","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":471392,"authors":[{"name":"M.G.

Pulse streams are quasi-periodic binary waveforms which convey analog information on waveform timing. The theoretical bases of pulse stream computation are shown for the major techniques, and basic circuits are described for most neural and fuzzy functions. Pulse stream modulations and multiplexing are then analyzed in terms of accuracy, response time, and both power and energy requirements. The performances of the various techniques are compared both with each other, and with those of other analog and digital computing systems. This paper shows that pulse stream systems are comparable with analog systems in terms of size, and comparable with both analog and digital systems in terms of speed. In addition, they offer an increased flexibility if compared to analog systems, and they have both a lower power dissipation and a lower computation energy figure than digital systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A performance analysis of pulse stream neural and fuzzy computing systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/82.471393","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/9940/00471393.pdf","startPage":"642","endPage":"660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.471393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9940","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=471393","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/471393/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"A performance analysis of pulse stream neural and fuzzy computing systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5110839","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A performance analysis of pulse stream neural and fuzzy computing systems","sourcePdf":"00471393.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076283S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"45","articleId":"471393","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":471394,"authors":[{"name":"S.J.

Generalized chirps are nonstationary signals characterized by group delays with specific dispersion law characteristics. Special cases of generalized chirps include linear chirps, and hyperbolic chirps that are Doppler-invariant signals. We optimally detect generalized chirps using generalized timeshift covariant quadratic time-frequency representations (QTFRs) such as hyperbolic QTFRs used for detecting hyperbolic chirps. We also propose the parameter estimation of generalized chirps, and specialize our simulation results to hyperbolic chirps. We combine phase unwrapping with linear regression of the phase data at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) to produce very simple and unbiased estimators that attain the Cramer-Rao lower bounds on variance. Maximum likelihood estimation performs well at low SNRs, but at the cost, of high computational complexity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1994.471415","startPage":"50","endPage":"54 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 28th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel2/3310/9941/00471415.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 28th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1994.471415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection and estimation of generalized chirps using time-frequency representations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chirp","Time frequency analysis","Parameter estimation","Delay","Computational modeling","Linear regression","Signal to noise ratio","Phase estimation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Computational efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-frequency analysis","delays","noise","maximum likelihood estimation","signal representation","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-frequency representations","generalized chirps estimation","generalized chirps detection","parameter estimation","noise","nonstationary signals","dispersion law characteristics","group delays","linear chirps","hyperbolic chirps","Doppler-invariant signals","generalized timeshift covariant representations","quadratic time-frequency representations","hyperbolic QTFR","simulation results","phase unwrapping","linear regression","high computational complexity","high signal-to-noise ratios","maximum likelihood estimation","unbiased estimators","Cramer-Rao lower bounds"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/471415/","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Oct-2 Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"Detection and estimation of generalized chirps using time-frequency representations","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"5073530","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection and estimation of generalized chirps using time-frequency representations","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00471415.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057752S","chronDate":"31 Oct-2 Nov 1994","isNumber":"9941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3310","citationCount":"9","articleId":"471415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":471424,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This extrapolation procedure which is based on iterative modification of the frequency weighting function in minimum weighted norm extrapolation produces high frequency-domain resolution. The approach presented is derived for totally arbitrary sampling configurations to include those that appear in inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging of a rotating object. The resulting procedure produces estimates of signal samples on rectangular coordinates in the neighborhood of the given samples (interpolation) as well as beyond (extrapolation). When applied to SAR/ISAR imaging, the procedure produces a complex reflectivity image in the slant-range cross-range domain from the samples of the object's Fourier transform, available at non-cartesian coordinate locations. Examples illustrate the performance of this interpolation/extrapolation procedure using samples of l-D and 2-D sums of complex sinusoids to simulate range profiles and images of a few point scatterers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/471434/","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Oct-2 Nov 1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5073549","volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Two-dimensional extrapolation and spectral estimation from arbitrary sampling configurations for SAR/ISAR imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-dimensional extrapolation and spectral estimation from arbitrary sampling configurations for SAR/ISAR imaging","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00471434.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055173S","chronDate":"31 Oct-2 Nov 1994","isNumber":"9941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3310","citationCount":"4","articleId":"471434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":471442,"authors":[{"name":"A.E. de la Serna","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"A.E.","lastName":"de la Serna","id":"38143619400"},{"name":"M.A. Soderstrand","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Soderstrand","id":"37271403000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-6405-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"471442","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":188},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Resource management","Roundoff errors","Finite impulse response filter","Digital filters","Optimization methods","Prototypes","Performance analysis","Logic","MATLAB"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FIR filters","field programmable gate arrays","application specific integrated circuits","roundoff errors","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA resource utilization","roundoff error","optimized CSD FIR digital filters","filter order","minimum bit coefficients","canonical signed digit coefficient representation","ASIC","word-length","CSD bit optimization","filter performance","FPGA logic capacity","MATLAB algorithm","FIR filter length","Kodek-Steiglitz theorem"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the trade off between filter order and bits of coefficient precision in fixed-coefficient FIR digital filters utilizing canonical signed digit (CSD) coefficient representation.

We examine the performance of wavelet transform-based adaptive filters. The application of two typical wavelets (D4 and Haar wavelets) are studied extensively as indicators of wavelet transform-based adaptive filter performance in general. Experimental results for a system identification application show an improvement in signal modelling and satisfactory convergence speed for a variety of equalisation conditions. We also compare the wavelet transform-based adaptive filters of Lee and Un (1986) to other transform-based adaptive filters such as discrete-cosine transform (DCT), discrete sine transform (DST), discrete Fourier transform (DFT), Walsh Hadamard transform (WHT) and discrete Hartley transform (DHT). The results of this comparison are mixed. We find that the performance depends on many factors but are consistent with the findings of Lee and Un. The results are also largely dependent on the properties of wavelets which have been found to be well suited for analyzing non-stationary signals. Finally, we present computational complexity considerations between these various transform-domain adaptive filters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1994.471462","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 28th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 28th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel2/3310/9941/00471462.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1994.471462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9941","startPage":"288","endPage":"292 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of wavelet transform-based adaptive filtering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=471462","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of wavelet transform-based adaptive filtering","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Oct-2 Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/471462/","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5056884","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of wavelet transform-based adaptive filtering","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00471462.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042101S","chronDate":"31 Oct-2 Nov 1994","isNumber":"9941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3310","citationCount":"1","articleId":"471462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":471463,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In the reciprocal circuit presented, they show how a numerator (scaling) can be easily incorporated into its design to achieve a general purpose divider. Both realizations have been demonstrated in an adaptive sample rate notch filter using Xilinx reconfigurable field programmable gate arrays (FPGA).

This is similar to deformable templates, but we attempt to perform the minimization in closed form.

VESPA can calibrate an array of unknown configuration and arbitrary response by using just one additional pair of identical sensors (instead of a copy of the entire array or storage of the entire array response for every possible scenario, which is required by existing alternatives). We present an approach that generalizes VESPA to handle the case of highly correlated or coherent sources. Unlike existing methods, our method is not restricted to linear arrays, and no search procedure is needed. Just as in VESPA, it is still possible to detect more sources than sensors, and suppress both Gaussian as well as non-Gaussian noise.

These techniques are limited, however, to cases of estimating a scalar direction parameter (say, either azimuth or elevation). The paper introduces a methodology for extending the polynomial rooting philosophy to the case of multidimensional arrays, which will be used to estimate jointly both azimuth and elevation parameters of the signal directions. It is shown via simulation that the resolution capabilities of the polynomial root intersection for multidimensional estimation (PRIME) class of algorithms is superior to the spectral algorithms they supplant, and that the variance of the direction estimates is equal to that of the corresponding spectral algorithms. It is shown analytically that the mean squared error of the PRIME estimates can be asymptotically equal to that of spectral MUSIC estimates. Finally, some extensions are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1994.471541","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 28th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 28th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel2/3310/9941/00471541.pdf","startPage":"694","endPage":"699 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1994.471541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A class of polynomial rooting algorithms for joint azimuth/elevation estimation using multidimensional arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=471541","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Oct-2 Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/471541/","displayDocTitle":"A class of polynomial rooting algorithms for joint azimuth/elevation estimation using multidimensional arrays","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5064126","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A class of polynomial rooting algorithms for joint azimuth/elevation estimation using multidimensional arrays","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00471541.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036898S","chronDate":"31 Oct-2 Nov 1994","isNumber":"9941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3310","citationCount":"15","articleId":"471541","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":471565,"authors":[{"name":"B.

As was shown there, an array of sensors (at least five) is needed for this purpose in general. In the present paper we propose to replace stationary sensors by moving sensors, thus gaining two important advantages. (1) A single moving sensor can accomplish the task of an array of stationary sensors, by exploiting spatial and temporal diversity. (2) The sensor motion can be planned in real time to optimize localization. Performance, based on past measurements and minimization of the expected localization error as a function of the future sensor's position.

For applications requiring 10/sup -3/ BER (e.g., voice), with a Rice factor of 6 dB, the capacity degradation compared to perfect power control is found to be less than 4% as long as the standard deviation of PCE (/spl sigma//sub /spl delta//) is less than 1 dB, and increases to 18% when /spl sigma//sub /spl delta// is 2 dB.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 28th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel2/3310/9942/00471579.pdf","startPage":"837","endPage":"841 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 28th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1994.471579","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1994.471579","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9942","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=471579","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of DS-CDMA networks on Rician fading channels with open-loop power control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Rician channels","Power control","Degradation","Direct-sequence code-division multiple access","Power measurement","Error correction","Random variables","System performance","Power system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","fading","power control","telecommunication control","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","Rician channels","log normal distribution","random processes","cellular radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DS-CDMA networks","Rician fading channels","open-loop power control","performance","direct sequence code division multiple access","open-loop power control scheme","forward link","reverse link","system capacity degradation","power control error","log-normally distributed random variable","channel model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/471579/","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Oct-2 Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"Performance of DS-CDMA networks on Rician fading channels with open-loop power control","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5064189","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of DS-CDMA networks on Rician fading channels with open-loop power control","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00471579.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031955S","chronDate":"31 Oct-2 Nov 1994","isNumber":"9942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3310","citationCount":"2","articleId":"471579","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":471582,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In order to analyze the performance of wireless communication systems, it is necessary to define models which reasonably approximate the time varying impulse response of the radio channel. Many widely accepted scalar channel (single antenna) statistical models have been reported. In order to analyze performance for real time adaptive antenna array techniques, it is necessary to extend existing scalar channel statistical models to the vector channel (multiple antenna) case. The paper develops a statistical, time varying, dispersive, wireless vector channel model which is based on the physical propagation environment. The model is shown to be consistent with the known characteristics of the wireless communication channel. Antenna pattern interference rejection as a function of update rate is presented as an application example for the vector channel model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1994.471582","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 28th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 28th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel2/3310/9942/00471582.pdf","startPage":"853","endPage":"857 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1994.471582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of fast fading vector channels for multi-antenna communication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=471582","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Oct-2 Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/471582/","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of fast fading vector channels for multi-antenna communication systems","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5064191","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of fast fading vector channels for multi-antenna communication systems","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00471582.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04847S","chronDate":"31 Oct-2 Nov 1994","isNumber":"9942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3310","citationCount":"66","articleId":"471582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":471583,"authors":[{"name":"A.F.

In the proposed IS-95 CDMA standard, no pilot is used in the reverse link due to power efficiency considerations. Therefore, an M-ary orthogonal modulation with noncoherent reception is used for this link. Spatial processing with base-station antenna arrays was proposed to reduce co-channel interference and increase system capacity.

Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the method by numerical examples.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1994.471601","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1994.471601","startPage":"954","endPage":"958 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 28th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel2/3310/9942/00471601.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 28th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Oversampled Gabor expansion into one-side exponential functions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Oct-2 Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"Oversampled Gabor expansion into one-side exponential functions","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 1994","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"5064207","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/471601/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oversampled Gabor expansion into one-side exponential functions","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00471601.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052203S","chronDate":"31 Oct-2 Nov 1994","isNumber":"9942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3310","articleId":"471601","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":471607,"authors":[{"name":"P.P.

At low SNR, shaping loss is negligible, but the THP systems again do not achieve capacity, largely due to the receiver modulo operation (and interleaving in the MMSE case).

We consider conditions on the matrix channel response for the existence of a zero-forcing equalizer (ZFE) (which cancels intersymbol and inter-user interference). In the noise free case, we show how a ZFE can be obtained from linear prediction and the channel matrix itself can also be determined as a byproduct. The problem is one of signal and noise subspaces and we show a convenient way of solving the deterministic maximum likelihood problem using a minimal linear parameterization of the noise subspace.

As the cost of the HPA was a dominant factor we examined continuous transmission schemes and concluded that CDMA was potentially attractive as with synchronous CDMA mutual interference can be zero. Therefore no sacrifice in bandwidth occupancy is needed and the 'demultiplexer' complexity is comparable to that for FDMA consisting of a FFT type processor involving only additions. A hybrid approach which reduces the peak processing requirement is the MF-CDMA scheme in which each 2 Mb/s carrier is shared using CDMA with different spreading factors but a common chip rate. This scheme is simple in demultiplexing, allows variable rate transmissions and avoids the synchronisation problems in a pure CDMA scheme.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1049/cp:19950004","publicationTitle":"1995 Tenth International Conference on Digital Satellite Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 Tenth International Conference on Digital Satellite Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/3311/9943/00471818.pdf","startPage":"17","endPage":"23 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:19950004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9943","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid CDMA scheme and demodulator structure for K/sub A/ band operation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=471818","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/471818/","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid CDMA scheme and demodulator structure for K/sub A/ band operation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"4992589","conferenceDate":"15-19 May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid CDMA scheme and demodulator structure for K/sub A/ band operation","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"00471818.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026612S","chronDate":"15-19 May 1995","isNumber":"9943","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3311","citationCount":"1","articleId":"471818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":471829,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This is achieved by having a dynamic network-one in which nodes are added to the network so as to progressively reduce the modelling error. This cascade correlation approach overcomes some of the disadvantages of a static network architecture. The learning algorithm is outlined, and its performance is demonstrated using simulations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Nonlinear systems","Signal processing algorithms","Wavelet analysis","Predictive models","Application software","Multilayer perceptrons","Radial basis function networks","Chaos","Signal generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transforms","signal processing","neural nets","time series","learning (artificial intelligence)","correlation theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical wavelet neural networks","wavelet decomposition","signal processing","multiple-scale signal examination","time series learning","modelling error reduction","nonlinear system modeling","prediction","dynamic network","cascade correlation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NNSP.1993.471883","publicationTitle":"Neural Networks for Signal Processing III - Proceedings of the 1993 IEEE-SP Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Networks for Signal Processing III - Proceedings of the 1993 IEEE-SP Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel2/3312/9944/00471883.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"67","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9944","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NNSP.1993.471883","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical wavelet neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=471883","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical wavelet neural networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/471883/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4985113","conferenceDate":"6-9 Sept. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Sep 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical wavelet neural networks","confLoc":"Linthicum Heights, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00471883.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.313988S","chronDate":"6-9 Sep 1993","isNumber":"9944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3312","citationCount":"3","articleId":"471883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":471887,"authors":[{"name":"E.D.

The AC-DC-AC converter is controlled by one single 16-b microcontroller. The converter has two PWM-VSI bridges with common snubber- and drive-circuit topologies. The high power factor rectifier is space vector controlled and the inverter controls an AC-induction machine by an energy optimized strategy. Common software tasks are utilized in order to minimize memory demands in the microcontroller. Measurements show a high power factor of the converter, and, in addition, the converter can very rapidly change from motor to generator operation during reversing of the AC machine. It is concluded that the AC-DC-AC converter works well, can be designed to be very compact, and represents some of the state-of-the-art integration and performance in three-phase AC-DC-AC converters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Power Electronics Specialist Conference - PESC '93","pdfPath":"/iel2/3313/9945/00471915.pdf","startPage":"285","endPage":"292","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Power Electronics Specialist Conference - PESC '93","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1993.471915","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1993.471915","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9945","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=471915","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An integrated high power factor three-phase AC-DC-AC converter for AC-machines implemented in one microcontroller","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reactive power","Analog-digital conversion","AC machines","Microcontrollers","Testing","Pulse width modulation","Pulse width modulation converters","Bridges","Topology","Rectifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-AC power convertors","AC-DC power convertors","AC machines","PWM power convertors","bridge circuits","PWM invertors","power factor","rectifiers","rectifying circuits","microcontrollers","machine control","digital control","snubbers","driver circuits","optimal control","AC-AC power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["snubber circuit","space vector control","energy optimal control","power factor","microcontroller","three-phase AC-DC-AC power converter","AC machines","PWM-VSI bridges","drive-circuit","rectifier","inverter","software","memory demands","generator operation","reversing","state-of-the-art","performance","16 bit"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/471915/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Jun 1993","displayDocTitle":"An integrated high power factor three-phase AC-DC-AC converter for AC-machines implemented in one microcontroller","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4991539","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An integrated high power factor three-phase AC-DC-AC converter for AC-machines implemented in one microcontroller","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00471915.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058667S","chronDate":"20-24 Jun 1993","isNumber":"9945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3313","citationCount":"33","articleId":"471915","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":471920,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

The electro-thermal simulations are performed using the Saber circuit simulator and include the control logic circuitry, the IGBT gate drivers, the physics-based IGBT electro-thermal model, and the thermal network component models for the power device silicon chips, packages, and heat sinks. It is shown that the thermal response of the silicon chip determines the IGBT temperature rise during the device switching cycle. The thermal response of the device TO247 package and silicon chip determines the device temperature rise during a single phase of the 60-Hz sinusoidal output. Also, the thermal response of the heat sink determines the device temperature rise during the system start-up and after load impedance changes. It is also shown that the full electro-thermal analysis is required to accurately describe the power losses and circuit efficiency.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1993.471938","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Power Electronics Specialist Conference - PESC '93","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Power Electronics Specialist Conference - PESC '93","pdfPath":"/iel2/3313/9945/00471938.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"84","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9945","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1993.471938","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=471938","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Jun 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/471938/","displayDocTitle":"Electro-thermal simulation of an IGBT PWM inverter","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4972675","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electro-thermal simulation of an IGBT PWM inverter","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00471938.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032714S","chronDate":"20-24 Jun 1993","isNumber":"9945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3313","citationCount":"21","articleId":"471938","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":471941,"authors":[{"name":"R.-H.

In this manner, the system can function as both a highly efficient power generator and a flexible reactive power compensator.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1993.471983","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Power Electronics Specialist Conference - PESC '93","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Power Electronics Specialist Conference - PESC '93","pdfPath":"/iel2/3313/9945/00471983.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1993.471983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9945","startPage":"568","endPage":"573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A flexible active and reactive power control strategy for a variable speed constant frequency generating system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=471983","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A flexible active and reactive power control strategy for a variable speed constant frequency generating system","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Jun 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/471983/","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4972732","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A flexible active and reactive power control strategy for a variable speed constant frequency generating system","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00471983.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033897S","chronDate":"20-24 Jun 1993","isNumber":"9945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3313","citationCount":"24","articleId":"471983","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":471984,"authors":[{"name":"C.R.

Such a power converter is currently under development, implementing a feedforward output current controller as tracking algorithm. The DC-DC power converter, typical of a MPPT, exploits the efficient high-frequency operation, associated with zero-transition switching. Thus the output filter only consists of the combination of a storage battery and its cabling. The resulting power converter is suitable for integration into standard PV panels during manufacturing. The efficiency of the MPPT is 96% for a range of output powers at a low battery voltage of 12.5 V and a component cost of US$21.00.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Economical, PV maximum power point tracking regulator with simplistic controller","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Power Electronics Specialist Conference - PESC '93","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1993.471985","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Power Electronics Specialist Conference - PESC '93","pdfPath":"/iel2/3313/9945/00471985.pdf","startPage":"581","endPage":"587","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1993.471985","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9945","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=471985","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/471985/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Jun 1993","displayDocTitle":"Economical, PV maximum power point tracking regulator with simplistic controller","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4972734","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Economical, PV maximum power point tracking regulator with simplistic controller","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00471985.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022879S","chronDate":"20-24 Jun 1993","isNumber":"9945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3313","citationCount":"23","articleId":"471985","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":471989,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Also, in this case, the high-order harmonic content is easily filtered.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1993.471995","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Power Electronics Specialist Conference - PESC '93","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Power Electronics Specialist Conference - PESC '93","pdfPath":"/iel2/3313/9945/00471995.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1993.471995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9945","startPage":"657","endPage":"662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-switch three-phase power factor preregulator under variable switching frequency and discontinuous input current","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=471995","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Single-switch three-phase power factor preregulator under variable switching frequency and discontinuous input current","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Jun 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/471995/","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4972745","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-switch three-phase power factor preregulator under variable switching frequency and discontinuous input current","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00471995.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05328S","chronDate":"20-24 Jun 1993","isNumber":"9945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3313","citationCount":"63","articleId":"471995","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":472009,"authors":[{"name":"B.K.

The scheme described has two rectifier terminals supplying a DC ring bus system capable supplying a large number of parallel inverters. The DC system incorporates energy storage systems to ride through an AC system outage until a backup generator is brought online. The scheme described utilizes superconductors on the DC bus, but the same basic scheme will work with ordinary conductors following some modification of the converter control.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Jun 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/472009/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4972759","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1993","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An industrial power distribution system featuring UPS properties","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An industrial power distribution system featuring UPS properties","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00472009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061485S","chronDate":"20-24 Jun 1993","isNumber":"9945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3313","citationCount":"33","articleId":"472009","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":472012,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A modified synchronous reference frame (SRF) based controller for the series active filter allows injection of a controlled percentage of the higher harmonic load currents into the supply, in compliance with the IEEE 519 harmonic current standards, thereby reducing the passive filter terminal voltage THD. This implementation retains all the desirable features of the original SRF controlled hybrid series active filter system. It reduces the rating and size of the passive filter system and allows the use of simpler passive filter system structures such as only a simple high pass passive filter or a simple power factor correction capacitor as the passive filter system. Simulation and experimental results are used to establish the functionality and performance of the SRF controller and the modified SRF controller for the hybrid series active filter system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1993.472012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9945","startPage":"779","endPage":"786","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Power Electronics Specialist Conference - PESC '93","pdfPath":"/iel2/3313/9945/00472012.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control and reduction of terminal voltage total harmonic distortion (THD) in a hybrid series active and parallel passive filter system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/472012/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Jun 1993","displayDocTitle":"Control and reduction of terminal voltage total harmonic distortion (THD) in a hybrid series active and parallel passive filter system","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1993","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4972762","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control and reduction of terminal voltage total harmonic distortion (THD) in a hybrid series active and parallel passive filter system","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00472012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031391S","chronDate":"20-24 Jun 1993","isNumber":"9945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3313","citationCount":"63","articleId":"472012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":472013,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The operating principle of the zero-voltage soft-switched three-phase AC-DC converter using ACRDCL under the control scheme of an instantaneous space voltage vector-based clamping-voltage distributed PDM (modified-PDM) scheme to improve its control response and operating performances is illustrated. Performance evaluations are discussed using simulation and experimental results, and a comparison with the conventional PDM converter is given. The experimental results of this active converter are shown from a practical point of view. Finally, the utility-interfaced ACRDCL double-converter system operating under the DSP controlled modified-PDM strategy is illustrated and evaluated by using simulation results under inductive load conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse modulation","AC-DC power converters","Digital signal processing","Voltage control","Pulse shaping methods","Digital modulation","Resonance","Digital signal processors","Shape control","Process control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-DC power convertors","power factor correction","switching circuits","digital control","power engineering computing","electric current control","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zero voltage soft switching","performance evaluations","current control","voltage control","active power converter","unity power factor","sinewave line current","pulse density modulation","three-phase AC-DC converter","active clamped resonant DC link","digital signal processor","control","power factor correction","sinewave line current shaping","operating principle","simulation","inductive load conditions"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PESC.1993.472013","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Power Electronics Specialist Conference - PESC '93","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Power Electronics Specialist Conference - PESC '93","pdfPath":"/iel2/3313/9945/00472013.pdf","startPage":"787","endPage":"794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9945","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1993.472013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zero-voltage soft-switched PDM three phase AC-DC active power converter operating at unity power factor and sinewave line current","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=472013","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Zero-voltage soft-switched PDM three phase AC-DC active power converter operating at unity power factor and sinewave line current","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/472013/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4972763","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Jun 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero-voltage soft-switched PDM three phase AC-DC active power converter operating at unity power factor and sinewave line current","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00472013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024504S","chronDate":"20-24 Jun 1993","isNumber":"9945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3313","citationCount":"18","articleId":"472013","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":472021,"authors":[{"name":"K.W.

The circuit consists of a phase-controlled inverter and a Class D current-driven rectifier. The phase-controlled inverter comprises two conventional Class D inverters driving the same AC load. The phase shift between the voltages that drive the MOSFETs is varied to control the AC current of the inverter and thereby regulate the DC output voltage of the converter. A frequency-domain analysis is used to derive basic equations which govern the circuit operation. The important advantage of the converter is that the operating frequency can be maintained constant. Unlike most phase-controlled converters, the load of each switching leg is inductive for operation above resonance and capacitive for operation below resonance, which is a very desirable feature. The theoretical and experimental results obtained were in good agreement.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1993.472042","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Power Electronics Specialist Conference - PESC '93","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Power Electronics Specialist Conference - PESC '93","pdfPath":"/iel2/3313/9945/00472042.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1993.472042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9945","startPage":"1002","endPage":"1008","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase control of series resonant converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=472042","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Phase control of series resonant converter","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Jun 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/472042/","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4972793","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase control of series resonant converter","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00472042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035699S","chronDate":"20-24 Jun 1993","isNumber":"9945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3313","citationCount":"12","articleId":"472042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":472078,"authors":[{"name":"C.R.

AEP jointly exploits spatial and temporal differences between consecutive observation intervals to null narrowband interference, evaluate an energy-based detection statistic, and upon detection compute a DF estimate of a newly turned-on signal. SSW exploits both spatial and spectral differences between the DSSS signal-of-interest (SOI), which has a constant direction of arrival (DOA) over a wide spectral extent, and strong spectrally localized interference to simultaneously form a decision statistic and a DF estimate.

This paper examines the multi-access properties of transform domain spread spectrum systems for use in tactical battlefield scenarios. Transform domain spread spectrum (XDSS) systems evolved as an attractive solution for low probability of detection/interception (LPD/I) systems that operate in interference and multipath environments. However, the same properties that make XDSS systems robust to interference and multipath, when combined with multi-access features, make XDSS systems attractive for tactical battlefields as well. We illustrate the advantages of transform domain spread spectrum over more traditional direct sequence spread spectrum methods by examining three multi-access techniques: (1) orthogonally coded direct sequence (OCDS), (2) cyclic code shift keying (CCSK), and (3) XDSS. All of these systems can be either coherent or noncoherent; however, we concentrate on non-coherent M-ary waveform modulation methods. We first show that while OCDS systems mitigate multi-user interference problems when the received user waveforms are synchronized, they lose this property when any time offsets are introduced by multipath and propagation delay. In addition, OCDS systems do not naturally resolve the time shifted versions caused by multipath, so RAKE processing for the M-ary signal set can be expensive. On the other hand, a CCSK system can readily use fast convolution methods to naturally resolve circularly delayed versions of the signal. Provided the processing gain is sufficiently large, a CCSK system can easily implement a RAKE combiner. The CCSK system, however, only provides isolation from other users by taking advantage of the low cross correlation properties of the spreading code. This make CCSK systems subject to near/far interference problems. By showing that XDSS systems have orthogonal CCSK signal sets, we illustrate how XDSS systems can provide robust, multi-access communications in tactical battlefield scenarios where ECCM and LPD/I properties are important.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9946","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of TCC'94 - Tactical Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of TCC'94 - Tactical Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/3314/9946/00472093.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCC.1994.472093","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCC.1994.472093","startPage":"505","endPage":"505","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-access properties of transform domain spread spectrum systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/472093/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-access properties of transform domain spread spectrum systems","conferenceDate":"10-12 May 1994","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5050524","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-access properties of transform domain spread spectrum systems","confLoc":"Fort Wayne, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"00472093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040452S","chronDate":"10-12 May 1994","isNumber":"9946","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3314","citationCount":"2","articleId":"472093","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":472165,"authors":[{"name":"Shousheng He","affiliation":["Department of Applied Electronics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"lastName":"Shousheng He","id":"37086978609"},{"name":"M.

A DFT of size N=M/sup 2/ can be computed in 2M steps of pipelined operations, achieving the optimal area-time complexity of AT/sup 2/=O(N/sup 2/). The orthogonal pipelining of the processing is obtained by exploiting the symbiosis between 1-dimensional systolic arrays of H.T. Kung (1980) and L.W. Chang and M.Y. Chen (1988). Compared with another 2D array based on \"sandwiched\" triple matrix product, the presented approach integrates the twiddle factor multiplication into the row transform. This not only reduces computational complexity and the size of coefficient matrix, but also eliminates the twiddle factor preloading procedure. DFT of size 2/sup L/N can be readily computed with 2/sup L/ N-size arrays abutted together.

Two of the training algorithms for Artificial Neural Networks implemented on RENNS, Back Propagation and Self-Organizing Maps, are briefly described, and it is shown how the communication system can be configured to speed up these algorithms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICAPP.1995.472186","startPage":"197","endPage":"206 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1st International Conference on Algorithms and Architectures for Parallel Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAPP.1995.472186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9947","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1st International Conference on Algorithms and Architectures for Parallel Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/3315/9947/00472186.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RENNS-a reconfigurable computer system for artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/472186/","displayDocTitle":"RENNS-a reconfigurable computer system for artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5064296","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-21 April 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Apr 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RENNS-a reconfigurable computer system for artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"00472186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039524S","chronDate":"19-21 Apr 1995","isNumber":"9947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3315","citationCount":"4","articleId":"472186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":472193,"authors":[{"name":"B.B.

Each computation unit has exactly the same number of elements and unknown values. The work involved in calculating the element matrices is equal, therefore the load can be well-balanced and the maximum speed-up will be M times if M processors are available (M is the number of harmonics considered in the electromagnetic field).

The performance of the CCI canceller (Yoon, et al., 1993) is extended and evaluated at the mobile station (MS) receiver operating in an extreme (worst) interference condition. The interference is a result of intersymbol interference (ISI) and multi-access interference (MAI) generated within the mother cell and from the neighboring cells. The MS, operating in a mobile communication system with a reuse factor of one, is assumed to be at the center of a triangle formed by three heavily loaded base stations (BS). The theoretical analysis of the system indicates that the co-code CCI (CCCCI), which is a CCI from users operating with the same spreading sequences in the neighboring cells, is a major degradation factor for the proposed systems' performance. Simulation results are also used to evaluate the system performance using the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and bit error rate (BER) versus the number of interfering users from within the cell and from the surrounding cells, and the normalized mean square error in parameters estimation (MSE).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings International Phoenix Conference on Computers and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3317/9950/00472420.pdf","startPage":"678","endPage":"683","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Phoenix Conference on Computers and Communications","doi":"10.1109/PCCC.1995.472420","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCC.1995.472420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9950","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=472420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Co-channel interference cancellation for DS-SS CDMA mobile communication system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interchannel interference","Interference cancellation","Multiaccess communication","Radiofrequency interference","Intersymbol interference","Mobile communication","Signal to noise ratio","Bit error rate","Multiple access interference","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","cochannel interference","parameter estimation","least mean squares methods","cellular radio","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference","interference suppression","spread spectrum communication","intersymbol interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["co-channel interference cancellation","DS-SS CDMA","mobile communication system","CCI canceller","performance","mobile station receiver","intersymbol interference","multi-access interference","heavily loaded base stations","co-code CCI","simulation results","system performance","signal to noise ratio","bit error rate","normalized mean square error","parameters estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/472420/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"Co-channel interference cancellation for DS-SS CDMA mobile communication system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5057216","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28-31 March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Co-channel interference cancellation for DS-SS CDMA mobile communication system","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00472420.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030047S","chronDate":"28-31 Mar 1995","isNumber":"9950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3317","citationCount":"2","articleId":"472420","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":472461,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.

This approach suffers from the high cost of trace generation and trace execution. Trace sampling techniques have been used for the study of cache memory systems as well as superscalar microprocessors. In spite of the desired features of sampled traces for studying cache behavior, the accuracy of such traces for general processor behaviors is unknown. Our experiments have shown that much smaller representative sampled traces can be generated for a class of applications such as SPEC Integer benchmarks to reduce the cost of design trade-offs and performance projections of the superscalar microprocessors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Microprocessors","Computational modeling","Cache memory","Hardware","Analytical models","Power engineering computing","Design engineering","Computer simulation","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microprocessor chips","performance evaluation","discrete event simulation","cache storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trace sampling","design trade-offs","microprocessors","SPEC Integer benchmarks","trace-driven simulation","performance","computer systems","trace generation","trace execution","cache memory systems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PCCC.1995.472506","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Phoenix Conference on Computers and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings International Phoenix Conference on Computers and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3317/9950/00472506.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"94","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCC.1995.472506","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trace sampling for design trade-offs of microprocessors using SPEC Integer benchmarks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=472506","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Trace sampling for design trade-offs of microprocessors using SPEC Integer benchmarks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/472506/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5057130","conferenceDate":"28-31 March 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Mar 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trace sampling for design trade-offs of microprocessors using SPEC Integer benchmarks","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00472506.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04421S","chronDate":"28-31 Mar 1995","isNumber":"9950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3317","citationCount":"2","articleId":"472506","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":472552,"authors":[{"name":"F.M.

This suggests that the neural net becomes an integrated part of the sensor during fabrication in silicon. A continuing problem in the present is there are many existing sensors (CCD, scanning detectors, etc.) that output their data in a serial pixel fashion. This paper investigates the design of a neural net architecture that can take noisy serial pixel sensor data as an input and report the detected target(s) position with respect to the sensor's field of view (FOV). A neural network target detection architecture is presented based on the Multilayer Perceptron Neural Receiver defined by Watterson [1]. The neural network was trained to detect a Gaussian spot and allowed to detect the target through various levels of white Gaussian noise. The neural network target detection architecture's performance in detecting a target was also investigated using row and column correlated types of noise. Through Monte Carlo simulations the performance characteristics are determined and represented as receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves aid compared to the ROC curves of a Rayleigh Channel Receiver. The neural network target detection architecture was found to exhibit a 75% improvement in the probability of detection than the Rayleigh Channel Receiver. Finally, the real-time computing requirements for the neural network architecture are addressed and presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ELECTR.1994.472684","pdfPath":"/iel2/3319/9952/00472684.pdf","startPage":"393","endPage":"403","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ELECTRO '94","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ELECTRO '94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ELECTR.1994.472684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A target detecting neural network architecture for serial sensor data streams","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/472684/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 May 1994","displayDocTitle":"A target detecting neural network architecture for serial sensor data streams","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5050434","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"10-12 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A target detecting neural network architecture for serial sensor data streams","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00472684.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036558S","chronDate":"10-12 May 1994","isNumber":"9952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3319","citationCount":"1","articleId":"472684","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":472686,"authors":[{"name":"P.E.

One of the missions of the Pacific Northwest Laboratory is to examine and develop new technologies for environmental restoration and waste management at the Hanford Site (a former Plutonium production facility). In this paper, three prototype sensing systems are discussed. These prototypes are composed of sensing elements, data acquisition system, computer, and neural network implemented in software and are capable of automatically identifying contaminants. The first system employs an array of tin-oxide gas sensors and is used to identify chemical vapors. The second system employs an array of optical sensors and is used to identify the composition of chemical dyes in liquids. The third system contains a portable gamma-ray spectrometer and is used to identify radioactive isotopes. In these systems, the neural network is used to identify the composition of the sensed contaminant. With a neural network, the intense computation takes place during the training process. Once the network is trained, operation consists of propagating the data through the network. Since the computation involved during operation consists of vector-matrix multiplication and application of look-up tables (activation function), unknown samples can be rapidly identified in the field.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/472686/","accessionNumber":"5050432","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-12 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Three neural network based, sensor systems for environmental monitoring","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three neural network based, sensor systems for environmental monitoring","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00472686.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027725S","chronDate":"10-12 May 1994","isNumber":"9952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3319","citationCount":"14","articleId":"472686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":472687,"authors":[{"name":"V.S.

Results are shown for both the modelling and control of the system including hybrid control strategies which combine neural predictive with conventional three term controllers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ELECTR.1994.472687","startPage":"369","endPage":"376","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ELECTRO '94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ELECTR.1994.472687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9952","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ELECTRO '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3319/9952/00472687.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based predictive control systems for underwater robotic vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/472687/","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based predictive control systems for underwater robotic vehicles","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5050431","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-12 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 May 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based predictive control systems for underwater robotic vehicles","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00472687.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075179S","chronDate":"10-12 May 1994","isNumber":"9952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3319","citationCount":"4","articleId":"472687","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":472689,"authors":[{"name":"J.

For the design of integrated circuits it can also be desirable to use a standard set of passive component values. For example, to obtain accurate ratio matching of integrated resistors and capacitors by stacking identical unit valued components. The usual design approaches produce circuits in which the permitted component values are assumed to be unrestricted. The circuit is then converted to a practical circuit by simple rounding of the exact component values to the nearest value in the permitted set. Of course, in general the circuit performance realised will differ from the ideal. It may then be necessary to repeat the design with a more stringent specification or to use a more closely spaced set of permitted values, both of which can have cost implications. However if other combinations of permitted values are considered, a better circuit performance may potentially be achieved than that obtained by simple rounding. The difficulty is that in all but trivially simple circuits the space of all feasible combinations to be searched is huge. Genetic algorithms (GAs) can be used to search this space. There the application is to a simple second order active filter specified by its transfer function parameters. The aim of the present contribution is to show that GAs can be successfully applied to more complex filter structures. Moreover the optimal search is carried out directly on the frequency-response template specification rather than on a specified approximating ideal transfer function, thereby avoiding this additional source of approximation. The next section outlines the basic GA and its implementation for the present application. Results are then given for practical filter examples. An all-pole low pass response is considered with template specified by a 1 dB pass band ripple with a pass band edge at 10/sup 5/ rad/sec, and stop band attenuation of -150 dB at a stop band edge of 10/sup 6/ rad/sec. The GA is used to generate both LC ladder structures and the more complex FDNR active RC structures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetically derived filter circuits using preferred value components","publicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Analogue Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Analogue Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/3324/9957/00472852.pdf","startPage":"4/1","endPage":"4/5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9957","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=472852","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/472852/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Genetically derived filter circuits using preferred value components","conferenceDate":"13-13 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4940228","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetically derived filter circuits using preferred value components","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00472852.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043096S","chronDate":"13 Oct 1994","isNumber":"9957","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3324","citationCount":"11","articleId":"472852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":472910,"authors":[{"name":"K.J.

An experimental power amplifier for L-band personal communications systems, which employs the cascode connection, shows good phase deviation performance. More than 20-dB gain, 21-dBm output power, and 50% power added efficiency are obtained along with the adjacent channel interference of -52 dBc in 192-kHz bands at 600-kHz offset frequency from 1.9 GHz at the operating voltage of only 3 V. The demonstrated performances satisfy the specifications for the 1.9-GHz Japanese Personal Handy-phone System (PHS) utilizing the /spl pi//4-shift QPSK modulation scheme.

The variational formulation is derived from the vector wave equation without any assumption or simplifications, and therefore the formulation is the full-wave analysis. Moderate to heavy ohmic loss and dielectric loss are taken into account in a natural and consistent manner. As a result, finite cross-section of arbitrary shape and finite conductivity can be handled without imposing the impedance boundary condition (IBC). The DEC may no longer be held for high-speed microelectronics applications, where the cross-section dimension may have been in the same order of the skin depths of some frequency components. The propagation modes are obtained by solving the large scale generalized eigenvalue and eigenvector equations employing the subspace iteration method. The spurious modes are totally suppressed in the whole frequency range of interest.

The method further allows for multi-frequency measurements using higher-order radial modes and somewhat alleviates the very small cavity dimensions typically required by the conventional perturbation technique at higher microwave frequencies.

Wheeler's model employs a conformal transformation to convert a microstrip into an enclosed waveguide structure. This permits the mapping of a discontinuous microstrip into a discontinuous, but enclosed, waveguide. The enclosed waveguide eliminates the difficulties usually associated with analysis of an open domain geometry. The FDTD technique is then used to calculate the scattering coefficients of the discontinuous waveguide. The features of this approach are: (1) it yields a smaller computational domain than that required to analyze the untransformed geometry; (2) it yields results over a band of frequencies; and (3) it is simple to implement. Results obtained using this scheme show good agreement with previously published results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of microstrip discontinuities using conformal mapping and the finite-difference time-domain method","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.473191","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/9980/00473191.pdf","startPage":"2636","endPage":"2639","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.473191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9980","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=473191","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/473191/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1995","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of microstrip discontinuities using conformal mapping and the finite-difference time-domain method","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","accessionNumber":"5134810","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of microstrip discontinuities using conformal mapping and the finite-difference time-domain method","sourcePdf":"00473191.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081142S","chronDate":"Nov 1995","isNumber":"9980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"4","articleId":"473191","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":473275,"authors":[{"name":"A.H.

A number of features are obtained from abdominal CT scans of the liver using the spatial domain statistical texture analysis methods: SGLDM, GLRLM, and GLDM. This study investigated whether (a) the texture could be used to discriminate among the various tissue types that are inaccessible to human perception and, (b) if so, then what are the most useful feature parameters for such an application? The efficacies of the different methods were evaluated from the consistency of the computed values within a class and from their differences with other classes. The study has demonstrated the use of texture for tissue characterization of CT images. In particular, we have been successful in identifying the onset of disease in liver tissue, which can not be recognized even by trained human observers. Three useful features, namely entropy (H), local homogeneity (L) and grey level distribution (GLD), have been found effective for pattern recognition. The performance of these features has been compared on the basis of statistical significance. The results show that, except for L, (Direction 0/spl deg/) all feature parameters perform equally well and detect early malignancy with a confidence level of above 99%-a finding that will not only help in automation, but more importantly, in early detection of malignancy in the liver.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/473275/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5134367","volume":"14","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Texture analysis of CT images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Texture analysis of CT images","sourcePdf":"00473275.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04132S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1995","isNumber":"9984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"51","citationCount":"81","articleId":"473275","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":473346,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In general, increasing the sensitivity of relays will lead to an increased likelihood of undesired operation whereas lowering the sensitivity will impair the responsiveness of the relays. Our proposed method meets these apparently incompatible requirements very well. Basically classified as a differential scheme, the HVDC transmission line protection method compensates for a charging and discharging current that flows through the line-to-ground capacitance at times of voltage variations caused by a line fault or by the operation of DC power systems. The developed protection method is also characterized in that it uses current changes induced by voltage variations to restrain the operation of a relay. This configuration has made the proposed method far superior in responsiveness and sensitivity to the conventional protection method. A simulation using an EMTP (Electro-Magnetic Transients Program) was conducted on this method. Developed relay equipment embodying the new protection method was subjected to various verification tests, where this equipment was connected to a power system simulator, before being delivered to the HVDC Link III facility.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New protection method for HVDC lines including cables","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/61.473346","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/9986/00473346.pdf","startPage":"2035","endPage":"2039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.473346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9986","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=473346","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/473346/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"New protection method for HVDC lines including cables","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5109846","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New protection method for HVDC lines including cables","sourcePdf":"00473346.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034056S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9986","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"66","articleId":"473346","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":473350,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Examples are thyristor-controlled inductors for FACTS, converters for HVDC transmission and large adjustable speed drives. All of these loads inject harmonic currents into the power system. A novel hybrid filter topology and its control, to prevent such harmonic currents from entering the power system, are presented in this paper. Analysis shows that in the proposed filter, the power electronic converter, required to generate harmonic currents for compensation, has a rating of only 9% when compared to the converter rating in an active filter and approximately one-half of that in a series-hybrid filter discussed in the literature. The proposed topology enables practical implementation of active harmonic current filters. The control of this filter under transient conditions such as start-up and during steady state is demonstrated by means of simulations. Results from a scaled-down hardware prototype are presented to verify the simulations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.473352","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","startPage":"1994","endPage":"2000","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/9986/00473352.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.473352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9986","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid-active filtering of harmonic currents in power systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power harmonic filters","Power system harmonics","Hybrid power systems","Filtering","Active filters","Power system analysis computing","Circuit topology","Inductors","HVDC transmission","Variable speed drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system harmonics","active filters","power convertors","power system transients","power system analysis computing","digital simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid-active filtering","harmonic currents","power systems","thyristor-controlled inductors","nonlinear loads","nonlinear devices","FACTS","HVDC transmission converters","adjustable speed drives","harmonic currents injection","power electronic converter","compensation","transient conditions","start-up","steady state"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid-active filtering of harmonic currents in power systems","volume":"10","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5109840","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/473352/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid-active filtering of harmonic currents in power systems","sourcePdf":"00473352.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05224S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9986","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"104","articleId":"473352","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":473363,"authors":[{"name":"T.S.

The algorithm is based on training of artificial neural networks (ANNs) using backpropagation. Due to the capability of parallel information processing of the ANNs, the proposed method is fast and yet accurate. Active and reactive powers of generators and loads, as well as the magnitudes of voltages at voltage-controlled buses are chosen as inputs to the ANN. System losses are chosen as the outputs. Training data are obtained by load flow studies, assuming that the state variables of the power system to be studied take the values uniformly distributed in the ranges of their lower and upper limits. Load flow studies for different system topologies are carried out and the results are compiled to form the training set. Numerical results are presented in the paper to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of accuracy and speed. It is concluded that the trained ANN can be utilized for both off-line simulation studies and on-line calculation of demand and energy losses. High performance has been achieved through complex mappings, modeled by the ANN, between system losses and system topologies, operating conditions and load variations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.473363","startPage":"1913","endPage":"1919","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.473363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9986","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/9986/00473363.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-line evaluation of capacity and energy losses in power transmission systems by using artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/473363/","displayDocTitle":"On-line evaluation of capacity and energy losses in power transmission systems by using artificial neural networks","volume":"10","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5109829","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-line evaluation of capacity and energy losses in power transmission systems by using artificial neural networks","sourcePdf":"00473363.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040947S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9986","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"6","articleId":"473363","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":473370,"authors":[{"name":"J.F.

The propagation of a lightning wave is simulated with EMTP, taking the skin effect and the corona effect into account. Simulation results are compared with tests performed on a real 220 kV line. It can be noticed that the incident lightning wave and induced waves are highly influenced by the skin effect and the corona effect.

In particular, the GaAs-AlAs VCA shows a bandwidth of 2 nm at 6-dB signal gain, while the GaAs-Al/sub x/O/sub 2/ VCA demonstrates a 5-nm bandwidth at 6-dB signal gain with no ripple at required single-pass power gain of /spl sim/2-2.5%.

Performance limitations due to impulse noise using a directly-modulated DFB laser transmitter and an externally-modulated YAG laser transmitter are presented. We also compared the BER characteristics of 256-QAM versus 64-QAM signals with either CW carriers or modulated video signals in such a hybrid system. Our results indicate that 64-QAM signal performance is more robust than that of 256-QA as expected. Significant 256-QAM BER degradation is observed with modulated AM-VSB video signals, making it necessary to use forward-error-correction code for robust 256-QAM transmission.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/9989/00473495.pdf","startPage":"1351","endPage":"1353","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doi":"10.1109/68.473495","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.473495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9989","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=473495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of hybrid multichannel AM/256-QAM video lightwave transmission systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical transmitters","Laser noise","Bit error rate","Laser modes","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Modems","Signal generators","Video compression","Robustness","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-access systems","television networks","video signals","amplitude modulation","optical modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","optical transmitters","distributed feedback lasers","semiconductor lasers","error correction codes","optical fibre subscriber loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid multichannel AM/256-QAM video lightwave transmission systems","impulse noise","directly-modulated DFB laser transmitter","externally-modulated YAG laser transmitter","BER characteristics","CW carriers","modulated video signals","64-QAM signal performance","modulated AM-VSB video signals","forward-error-correction code","robust 256-QAM transmission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/473495/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Performance of hybrid multichannel AM/256-QAM video lightwave transmission systems","volume":"7","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","accessionNumber":"5129291","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of hybrid multichannel AM/256-QAM video lightwave transmission systems","sourcePdf":"00473495.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025685S","chronDate":"Nov.  1995","isNumber":"9989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"20","articleId":"473495","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":473499,"authors":[{"name":"O.

The complexity of these problems is so overwhelming that exhaustive search of the solution space is not possible even using massively parallel search techniques, particularly for problems of super-exponential complexity such as flow-shop and job-shop scheduling. This two-part paper discusses a novel, inherently parallel heuristic solution technique. Part I presents this technique, known as parallel dynamic interaction (PDI), as a general solution framework that is applicable to a number of computationally intractable problems, and gives details of its general methodology. From a parallel processing standpoint, PDI is interesting because it is inherently based upon the dynamic interplay between simultaneously executing subproblems. As such, PDI has no direct serial analog, and is not directly amenable to conventional parallel processing speedup analysis. This may provide an indication that parallel processing can offer opportunities beyond simply speeding up the solution of sequentially specified algorithms. From a practical problem-solving perspective, PDI shows promise as a method capable of generating high quality solutions to exponentially and super-exponentially hard problems. For large problems, PDI is often able to find a near-optimal solution many orders of magnitude faster than the time taken for a conventional parallel branch-and-bound search to find a solution of comparable quality.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/473511/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","volume":"6","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5116976","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"An inherently parallel method for heuristic problem-solving.

This paper presents the application of parallel dynamic interaction (PDI) to three real problem domains: the flowshop scheduling problem, the job-shop scheduling problem and the vertex cover problem. Specific examples are provided as to how the general PDI framework, introduced in part I of this paper, can be applied to a particular problem. The results of an empirical study of 90 example instances of these problems indicate that PDI consistently out-performs previously published heuristics for the vertex cover problem, and can typically generate solutions within a few percent of optimal for flow-shop and job-shop problems. Out of the 76 examples for which the optimal solution could be determined, PDI was able to produce results averaging within 4% of optimal. In over 30% of the cases, PDI was able to find the optimal solution. In no case did the PDI solution deviate more than 15% from optimal. It is also seen that the time taken by PDI to arrive at these solutions is negligible compared to that taken by conventional search techniques. This provides strong empirical evidence that PDI is capable of generating high quality solutions to exponentially and super-exponentially hard problems in reasonably short periods of time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Problem-solving","Job shop scheduling","Graph theory","Heuristic algorithms","Scheduling algorithm","Tail","Variable speed drives","Silicon","Computer graphics","Cities and towns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scheduling","heuristic programming","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inherently parallel method","heuristic problem-solving","parallel dynamic interaction","flowshop scheduling","job-shop scheduling","vertex cover problem"]}],"doi":"10.1109/71.473512","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/9990/00473512.pdf","startPage":"1016","endPage":"1028","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.473512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An inherently parallel method for heuristic problem-solving.

A first approach by W.J. Dally and C.L. Seitz (1987) consists of removing the cyclic dependencies between channels. Many deterministic and adaptive routing algorithms have been proposed based on that approach. Although the absence of cyclic dependencies is a necessary and sufficient condition for deadlock-free deterministic routing, it is only a sufficient condition for deadlock-free adaptive routing. A more powerful approach by J. Duato (1991) only requires the absence of cyclic dependencies on a connected channel subset. The remaining channels can be used in almost any way. In this paper, we show that the previously mentioned approach is also a sufficient condition. Moreover, we propose a necessary and sufficient condition for deadlock-free adaptive routing. This condition is the key for the design of fully adaptive routing algorithms with minimum restrictions, An example shows the application of the new theory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/71.473515","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","startPage":"1055","endPage":"1067","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/9990/00473515.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.473515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A necessary and sufficient condition for deadlock-free adaptive routing in wormhole networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sufficient conditions","System recovery","Routing","Intelligent networks","Algorithm design and analysis","Bandwidth","Multiprocessor interconnection networks","Delay","Adaptive systems","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hypercube networks","deterministic algorithms","concurrency control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["necessary and sufficient condition","deadlock-free adaptive routing","wormhole networks","deadlock avoidance","cyclic dependencies","deadlock-free deterministic routing","fully adaptive routing algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"A necessary and sufficient condition for deadlock-free adaptive routing in wormhole networks","volume":"6","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5116980","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/473515/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A necessary and sufficient condition for deadlock-free adaptive routing in wormhole networks","sourcePdf":"00473515.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041955S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"240","articleId":"473515","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":473529,"authors":[{"name":"B.

In the MPML, the introducing of extra degrees of freedom provides the possibility of adjusting the parameters of nonphysical material absorber (PML) for the purpose of enhancing the attenuation rate of the evanescent modes. Compared to Berenger PML, the MPML is more efficient in absorbing the evanescent energy and keeps the same performance for propagation modes. The sophisticated properties of MPML ABC result in the reduction of the thickness of the matched tapers and their closer allocation, leading to better accuracy simulations and less computer burdens in FD-TD modeling.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/75/9991/00473529.pdf","startPage":"399","endPage":"401","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","doi":"10.1109/75.473529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/75.473529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9991","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=473529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified Berenger PML absorbing boundary condition for FD-TD meshes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Boundary conditions","Attenuation","Electromagnetic waveguides","Electromagnetic scattering","Light scattering","Tellurium","Equations","Impedance","Senior members","Perfectly matched layers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["waveguide theory","finite difference time-domain analysis","electromagnetic wave absorption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified perfectly matched layer absorbing boundary condition","MPML ABC","FD-TD meshes","nonphysical material absorber","attenuation rate","evanescent mode","Berenger PML","propagation modes","matched taper thickness","simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/473529/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1995","displayDocTitle":"Modified Berenger PML absorbing boundary condition for FD-TD meshes","volume":"5","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","accessionNumber":"5110718","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified Berenger PML absorbing boundary condition for FD-TD meshes","sourcePdf":"00473529.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040813S","chronDate":"Nov 1995","isNumber":"9991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"75","citationCount":"78","articleId":"473529","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":473533,"authors":[{"name":"Huei Wang","affiliation":["Electronic Systems and Technology Division, TRW, Redondo Beach, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Huei Wang","id":"37087149107"},{"name":"Kwo-Wei Chang","affiliation":["Electronic Systems and Technology Division, TRW, Redondo Beach, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Kwo-Wei Chang","id":"37087209760"},{"name":"D.C.-W.

As such, this architecture offers a feasible solution for progressive-scan HDTV picture format.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/9992/00473553.pdf","startPage":"407","endPage":"416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel modular systolic array architecture for full-search block matching motion estimation","doi":"10.1109/76.473553","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9992","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.473553","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=473553","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/473553/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"A novel modular systolic array architecture for full-search block matching motion estimation","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5110728","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel modular systolic array architecture for full-search block matching motion estimation","sourcePdf":"00473553.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031697S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"109","articleId":"473553","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":473554,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Optimized efficiency for variable algorithm parameters is obtained by using a quadratic systolic array architecture with global accumulation, combined with a flexible meander-like data flow.

The IMAP chip integrates 2 Mb image memory and 64 processing elements that operate in the SIMD mode. The RVSC chip performs global data operations efficiently without interactions with the host workstation, as well providing an instruction stream to the IMAP chips.

With modular and regular structures, the IDCT VLSI chip can be operated in a progressive transform mode.

Each CNN is defined mathematically by its cell dynamics (e.g., state equations) and synaptic law, which specifies each cell's interaction with its neighbors. We focus on reaction-diffusion CNNs having a linear synaptic law that approximates a spatial Laplacian operator. Such a synaptic law can be realized by one or more layers of linear resistor couplings. An autonomous CNN made of third-order universal cells and coupled to each other by only one layer of linear resistors provides a unified active medium for generating trigger (autowave) waves, target (concentric) waves, spiral waves, and scroll waves. When a second layer of linear resistors is added to couple a second capacitor voltage in each cell to its neighboring cells, the resulting CNN can be used to generate various turing patterns.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/9993/00473564.pdf","startPage":"559","endPage":"577","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.473564","doi":"10.1109/81.473564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9993","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autonomous cellular neural networks: a unified paradigm for pattern formation and active wave propagation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"Autonomous cellular neural networks: a unified paradigm for pattern formation and active wave propagation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/473564/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5136266","volume":"42","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autonomous cellular neural networks: a unified paradigm for pattern formation and active wave propagation","sourcePdf":"00473564.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078403S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"202","articleId":"473564","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":473566,"authors":[{"name":"K.R.

It is shown through simple examples that the four inequalities known as the Turing instability conditions are only necessary but not sufficient conditions for Turing patterns to exist. The influence of various parameters, initial conditions as well as sidewall forcing on the final patterns and the possibilities of eliminating defects are studied by means of computer simulations. The possibility of generating perfectly regular patterns or patterns with few defects through the application of small and short controlling signals at one boundary suggests the intriguing possibility of producing high-purity high-tech materials, such as crystals, which was not possible with current technology. In addition, novel applications in image processing, pattern recognition, and other areas can be expected.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/473569/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5136271","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Turing patterns in CNNs.

We have found that the Cellular Neural Network can produce patterns similar to those found in Ising spin glass systems, discrete bistable systems, and the reaction-diffusion system. A thorough analysis of a 1-D CNN whose cells are coupled to immediate neighbors allows us to completely characterize the patterns that can exist as stable equilibria, and to measure their complexity thanks to an entropy function. In the 2-D case, we do not restrict the symmetric coupling between cells to be with immediate neighbors only or to have a special diffusive form. When larger neighborhoods and generalized diffusion coupling are allowed, it is found that some new and unique patterns can be formed that do not fit the standard ferro-antiferromagnetic paradigms. We have begun to develop a theoretical generalization of these paradigms which can be used to predict the pattern formation properties of given templates. We give many examples. It is our opinion that the Cellular Neural Network model provides a method to control the critical instabilities needed for pattern formation without obfuscating parameterizations, complex nonlinearities, or high-order cell states, and which will allow a general and convenient investigation of the essence of the pattern formation properties of these systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pattern formation properties of autonomous Cellular Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","doi":"10.1109/81.473585","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/9993/00473585.pdf","startPage":"757","endPage":"774","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.473585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9993","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=473585","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/473585/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"Pattern formation properties of autonomous Cellular Neural Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5136287","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pattern formation properties of autonomous Cellular Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"00473585.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044356S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"91","articleId":"473585","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":473586,"authors":[{"name":"Chai Wah Wu","affiliation":["Electronics Research Laboratory and Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Chai Wah Wu","id":"37087196124"},{"name":"L.O.

Emanuel et al. [see Geophys. Res., vol. 100, no. D7, pp. 13,755-13,765 (1995)] believe that neither bolide (exploding meteor) impacts nor large-scale volcanism alone have the force to inject enough material into the stratosphere for sufficient time to cause mass extinctions. They propose that one of the suspects may have created a massive storm called a hypercane. Theoretically, hypercanes are extremely intense hurricanes formed when the air-sea thermodynamic equilibrium exceeds a threshold, i.e. the bolide impact or volcanism heats the ocean so much that a massive hurricane forms. A hypercane could inject enormous quantities of water vapor, condensed water and ash into the stratosphere, with potentially disastrous results. To determine the possibility of hypercanes, Emanuel modified a numerical hurricane model and executed it on the National Center for Atmospheric Research's Cray Y-MP. They added a sea surface temperature anomaly to represent the abnormal increase in temperature caused by bolide impact or undersea volcanism. To trigger the hypercane, they used an initial vortex with wind speeds of 12 m/s. Emanuel and his colleagues conclude that the simulation works well for the period of the storm's transition to a hypercane, but it does not fully explain mature hypercane behavior. However, they believe the model's success shows that hypercanes are possible.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/473603/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Winter 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Winter 1995","publicationDate":"Winter 1995","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5123899","volume":"3","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Stormy weather main suspect in dinosaur disappearance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stormy weather main suspect in dinosaur disappearance","sourcePdf":"00473603.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020966S","chronDate":"Winter 1995","isNumber":"9994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"88","articleId":"473603","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":473612,"authors":[{"name":"M.

An approximate probability density function (PDF) for the single-term approximation to the average log-likelihood-ratio (ALLR) which is valid at all SNR values is presented and its superior accuracy, compared to the low SNR pdf, is verified via computer simulation. Computer simulation is also used to show that multiple-term approximations to the ALLR may provide significant performance gains relative to their individual terms. A simple, practical method for setting the threshold of the ALLR test is presented and it is shown, through simulation, that little performance degradation is suffered relative to the optimal setting, which is difficult to determine analytically in most cases.

This receiver structure is known to be near-far resistant and yet does not require the large amounts of side information that are typically required for other near-far resistant receivers. In fact this receiver only requires code timing on the one desired signal. The MMSE receiver uses an adaptive filter which is operated in a manner similar to adaptive equalizers. Initially there is a training period where the filter locks onto the signal that is sending a known training sequence. After training the system can then switch to a decision directed mode and send actual data. This work examines the length of the training period needed as a function of the number of interfering users and the severity of the near far problem. A standard LMS algorithm is used to adapt the filter and so the trade off between convergence and excess mean squared error is studied. It is found that in almost all cases a step size near 1.0/(total input power) gives the best compromise between speed of convergence and excess mean squared error. Also, it is shown that the MMSE receiver can tolerate about 30-40 dB worth of near-far problem before the convergence time becomes unacceptable.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transient behavior of the minimum mean-squared error receiver for direct-sequence code-division multiple-access systems","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '94","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1994.473838","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3347/9998/00473838.pdf","startPage":"52","endPage":"56 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1994.473838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9998","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=473838","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/473838/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Transient behavior of the minimum mean-squared error receiver for direct-sequence code-division multiple-access systems","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5064026","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transient behavior of the minimum mean-squared error receiver for direct-sequence code-division multiple-access systems","confLoc":"Fort Monmouth, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00473838.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025748S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","isNumber":"9998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3347","citationCount":"4","articleId":"473838","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":473839,"authors":[{"name":"R.F.

The receiver consists of a chip matched filter followed by an adaptive equalizer. By using a simple channel-access protocol, the timing information for a new system user can be extracted from the weights of the adaptive equalizer. In order to obtain this timing information, the receiver only requires knowledge of the spreading code of the new user. A maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation algorithm is given based on several simplistic assumptions on the statistical properties of the adaptive filter tap weights.

The effect of the spreading code length on system performance is of special interest. The probability of a partial cross-correlation value between segments of long sequences is also discussed. The values of the spreading factor for a BPSK type spectrum spreading are 127 and 255. Ideal code, carrier and symbol synchronization, and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel are employed in the system model. Results indicate that the system performance with long spreading codes (period of 2/sup 30/-1) is about 1.0 dB worse than that of short CDMA sequences when E/sub h//N/sub 0/ is about 10 dB. The loss in BER or in signal-to-noise ratio is tolerable, since long codes allow individual user addresses to be implemented for each user of a large asynchronous cellular CDMA network without need for re-allocation of codes. The network planning and implementation becomes easier as there is no need for code change in a handover situation. Long spreading codes also provide flexibility with respect to multiple bit rates and variable spreading factors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3347/9998/00473865.pdf","startPage":"780","endPage":"784 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '94","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1994.473865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1994.473865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9998","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=473865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of an asynchronous DS-CDMA system with long and short spreading codes-a simulation study","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Bit error rate","AWGN","System performance","Software performance","Binary phase shift keying","Additive white noise","Signal to noise ratio","Cellular networks","Bit rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronisation","Gaussian channels","code division multiple access","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","error statistics","Monte Carlo methods","cellular radio","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference","phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous DS-CDMA system","spreading codes","bit error rate performance","asynchronous direct-sequence code-division multiple-access","Monte Carlo simulation","SPW/sup TM/ software","partial cross-correlation value","segments","long sequences","spreading factor","BPSK type spectrum spreading","carrier synchronization","symbol synchronization","additive white Gaussian noise channel","signal-to-noise ratio","asynchronous cellular CDMA network","network planning","implementation","handover situation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/473865/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Performance of an asynchronous DS-CDMA system with long and short spreading codes-a simulation study","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5057024","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of an asynchronous DS-CDMA system with long and short spreading codes-a simulation study","confLoc":"Fort Monmouth, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00473865.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027874S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","isNumber":"9998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3347","citationCount":"2","articleId":"473865","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":473868,"authors":[{"name":"Y.M.

One of the issues which can impact the performance of a DS-SS communication system is the near-far effect. The near-far effect occurs when a powerful incident signal (desired or undesired) overwhelms desired DS-SS signals. One of several possible ways to lessen this effect is to use an adaptive antenna array at the DS-SS receiver. Of particular interest is the special case of a single receiver which must detect multiple desired signals. This might occur in commercial NAVSTAR GPS receivers and in mobile cellular base station receivers. This paper examines the steady-state performance of adaptive antenna arrays which are based on a minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) optimization criterion. The beamforming array is limited to a single feedback loop, and a single array output, which supports multiple received signals. It is shown that a single-loop MMSE array can level the output signal-to-noise ratios to nearly the same level and thus eliminate the near-far effect.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1994.473874","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3347/9998/00473874.pdf","startPage":"733","endPage":"737 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1994.473874","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive antenna array for multiple received signals in direct-sequence code-division multiple-access communication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=473874","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/473874/","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive antenna array for multiple received signals in direct-sequence code-division multiple-access communication systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5057015","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive antenna array for multiple received signals in direct-sequence code-division multiple-access communication systems","confLoc":"Fort Monmouth, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00473874.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054514S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","isNumber":"9998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3347","citationCount":"3","articleId":"473874","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":473877,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

The mechanism is based upon an accurate estimation of the probability density function (pdf) of the traffic via its count process and the design of a NN critic function capable of evaluating the system performance in terms of the pdf violation. The pdf-based policing is made possible only by NNs. This is due to the fact that pdf policing requires complex calculations, in real-time, at very high rates which is not feasible via conventional mathematical approaches. The architecture of the NN policing mechanism is composed of critic function and control function. The critic function uses two inter-connected NNs. The first NN is trained to learn the pdf of \"ideal non-violating\" traffic, whereas the second NN is trained to capture the \"actual\" characteristics of the \"actual\" offered traffic during the progress of the call. The output of both NNs is compared. Consequently, an error signal is generated whenever the pdf of the offered traffic violates its \"ideal\" case. The error signal is, then, used by the critic function to produce an evaluation signal based upon a certain performance measure. A reinforcement learning method uses the evaluation signal to adjust the weights of a third NN, in the control function that generates a control signal capable of maximizing the system performance. The reported results prove that the present policing mechanism is very effective in detecting (and controlling) all possible kinds of traffic violations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1994.473877","startPage":"718","endPage":"722 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3347/9998/00473877.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1994.473877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network controller using reinforcement learning method for ATM traffic policing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Learning","Communication system traffic control","Contracts","Quality of service","Asynchronous transfer mode","Telecommunication traffic","System performance","Signal generators","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","telecommunication network management","telecommunication control","asynchronous transfer mode","telecommunication traffic","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network controller","reinforcement learning method","ATM traffic policing","probability density function","count process","critic function","system performance","architecture","ideal nonviolating traffic","error signal","offered traffic","evaluation signal"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/473877/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"A neural network controller using reinforcement learning method for ATM traffic policing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"5057012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network controller using reinforcement learning method for ATM traffic policing","confLoc":"Fort Monmouth, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00473877.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039851S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","isNumber":"9998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3347","citationCount":"2","articleId":"473877","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":473878,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The authors also investigate their tracking performance in the presence of multi-user interference in a code-division multiple access (CDMA) system where the users have unequal power levels. The performance of the non-channel aided (NCA) algorithm was found to be independent of the fading characteristics, whereas the channel aided (CA) algorithm is influenced by the carrier-to-multipath ratio C/M, but not by the fading bandwidth. For practical E/sub s//N/sub 0/, the NCA algorithm outperforms the CA algorithm, whose performance degrades with decreasing C/M. The performance of both algorithms is better for synchronous than for asynchronous CDMA. For large signal-to-noise ratio, the tracking error variances approach asymptotic values that are inversely proportional to the ratio of the reference user power to the total power of the multi-user interference.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3347/9998/00473901.pdf","startPage":"593","endPage":"597 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '94","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1994.473901","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1994.473901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9998","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=473901","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NDA chip synchronization for bandlimited DS/SS M-PSK signals using CDMA with unequal power levels on nonselective fading channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Fading","Interference","Spread spectrum communication","Bandwidth","Timing","AWGN","Maximum likelihood estimation","Power engineering and energy","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronisation","code division multiple access","radiofrequency interference","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","phase shift keying","fading","maximum likelihood estimation","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NDA chip synchronization","bandlimited DS/SS M-PSK signals","CDMA","power levels","nonselective fading channels","maximum-likelihood oriented nondecision-aided chip synchronization","bandlimited direct-sequence spread spectrum M-PSK signal","tracking performance","multi-user interference","code-division multiple access","performance","nonchannel aided algorithm","channel aided algorithm","carrier-to-multipath ratio","fading bandwidth","tracking error variances","reference user power"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/473901/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"NDA chip synchronization for bandlimited DS/SS M-PSK signals using CDMA with unequal power levels on nonselective fading channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5056988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NDA chip synchronization for bandlimited DS/SS M-PSK signals using CDMA with unequal power levels on nonselective fading channels","confLoc":"Fort Monmouth, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00473901.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032801S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","isNumber":"9998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3347","citationCount":"2","articleId":"473901","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":473902,"authors":[{"name":"S.

These waveforms are specifically tailored for a class of near-far resistant multiuser detectors, They are strictly time-limited, satisfy a root mean square (RMS) bandwidth constraint, and provide a prescribed worst-case near-far resistance. The optimization criterion is either the maximum worst-case pairwise near-far resistance (NFR), or the maximum worst-case pairwise asymptotic multiuser efficiency (AME) of an L-shot decorrelating detector over all relative delays of users. These signal sets are shown to be immune to synchronization errors as well by using slope constraints of partial cross-correlations over relative delays.

To this end, we propose a multiple substream abstraction for source traffic, with delay and loss characteristics negotiated between the application and network on a per-substream basis. This model affords flexibility while maintaining network efficiency by only appropriating more resources (e.g. Bandwidth and error protection) to more important user information. We describe an algorithm for supporting different quality of service (QOS) requirements for different traffic in an interference-limited cellular CDMA environment. The algorithm accepts QOS specifications for different substreams, accommodates them by assigning different power levels to each signal, and can be used to add or drop substream connections dynamically while ensuring that QOS specifications are not violated. Present-day power control schemes are used to combat the near-far effect; while the proposed algorithm also accomplishes this goal, it is in fact more general: via power modulation, it can provision different QOS levels for different substreams.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1994.473953","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3347/9998/00473953.pdf","startPage":"178","endPage":"182 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1994.473953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power control for variable QOS on a CDMA channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/473953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Power control for variable QOS on a CDMA channel","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5056748","publicationDate":"1994","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power control for variable QOS on a CDMA channel","confLoc":"Fort Monmouth, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00473953.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03337S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","isNumber":"9998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3347","citationCount":"74","articleId":"473953","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":473954,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Shen","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"lastName":"Qiang Shen","id":"37345221500"},{"name":"A.K.

Transmitters choose spreading codes based on the types of messages they are transmitting, and receivers listen to codes corresponding to the types of messages they are interested in. The performance of this approach can exceed that of both the traditional receiver-directed codes or broadcast codes in environments where there are several multicast groups (in which a given message is of interest to more than one node). Performance is further enhanced when receivers can simultaneously attempt to correlate multiple spreading codes. In a previous paper the authors (see IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM), p.556-560, Boston, October 1993) demonstrated the superiority of CDMA-IC over receiver-directed CDMA and broadcasting, using simulation of some preliminary concepts of the scheme. In this paper, we describe a broader theoretical framework considering such attributes as priorities, relevance and 'value' of the messages, in which the CDMA-IC scheme scheme could be tailored for different scenarios and could be parameterized appropriately.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1994.473972","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3347/9998/00473972.pdf","startPage":"962","endPage":"966 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1994.473972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new CDMA scheme for multicasting using information classes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=473972","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/473972/","displayDocTitle":"A new CDMA scheme for multicasting using information classes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5050796","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new CDMA scheme for multicasting using information classes","confLoc":"Fort Monmouth, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00473972.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029527S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","isNumber":"9998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3347","citationCount":"1","articleId":"473972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":473981,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Field measurements have verified the validity of the model. There is a clear advantage to using a directional antenna at the mobile terminal for a B-CDMA spread spectrum signal at 1.9 GHz. To be able to realize the full advantage of the directional antenna, one must estimate the DOA. Field data shows an improvement of 6.5 to 7.5 dB for an 8.0 dBi directional antenna as compared to a 0.0 dBi omnidirectional antenna. This is contrary to previously reported results (that were based on tests of FM signals in a macro-cellular environment). The directional antenna helps in reducing the fade depth and duration, and improves SNR when pointed in the right direction. Allocation of higher frequencies (1.9 GHz) for PCS, enables the use of a compact, yet a highly directional antenna at the mobile. The 6 GHz band is being investigated by AT&T for future PCS applications. Closing the link at 6 GHz may require the use of a directional antenna. The paper proves that it may be advantageous, and proposes a model that may be used to optimize other system parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1994.473981","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3347/9998/00473981.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1994.473981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9998","startPage":"918","endPage":"922 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvement for the B-CDMA PCS links in an urban environment by using a directional antenna at the mobile terminal","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=473981","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improvement for the B-CDMA PCS links in an urban environment by using a directional antenna at the mobile terminal","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/473981/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5050787","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvement for the B-CDMA PCS links in an urban environment by using a directional antenna at the mobile terminal","confLoc":"Fort Monmouth, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00473981.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036182S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","isNumber":"9998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3347","citationCount":"2","articleId":"473981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":473982,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The scheme operates on the fact that parallel processing simultaneously removes from each user the total interference produced by the remaining most reliably received users accessing the channel. The parallel processing can be done in multiple stages. The proposed scheme uses tentative decision devices with different optimum thresholds at the multiple stages to produce the most reliably received data for generation and cancellation of user interference. The 1-stage interference cancellation is analyzed for three types of tentative decision devices, namely hard, null zone, and soft decision. Simulation results are given for 1- and 2-stage interference cancellation for equal as well as unequal power users.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Interference cancellation","Propulsion","Laboratories","Degradation","Parallel processing","Additive noise","Space technology","Delay effects","Maximum likelihood detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","parallel processing","interference suppression","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDMA performance","parallel interference cancellation","degradation effect","user interference","implementation complexity","parallel processing","tentative decision devices","optimum thresholds","multiple stages","cancellation","1-stage interference cancellation","hard decision","null zone decision","soft decision","2-stage interference cancellation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=473982","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1994.473982","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3347/9998/00473982.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1994.473982","startPage":"911","endPage":"917 vol.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9998","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '94","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved CDMA performance using parallel interference cancellation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improved CDMA performance using parallel interference cancellation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/473982/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 1994","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5050786","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved CDMA performance using parallel interference cancellation","confLoc":"Fort Monmouth, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00473982.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038839S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","isNumber":"9998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3347","citationCount":"53","articleId":"473982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":473991,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

Such a scheme, implemented on the uplink, ensures that all users' signals arrive at the base station with equal average power as they move within the satellite spot beam-an important requirement in a CDMA system. Because of the lengthy round-trip delay on a satellite link, closed-loop power control systems are only of marginal benefit. Monk et al (1994) proposed an open-loop APC scheme to counteract the effects of large scale losses. A model was developed to characterize the performance of the APC. In this paper, we use the model to derive the overall system performance of shadowed users on the uplink of a coherent, asynchronous, coded CDMA system, on a land mobile satellite link.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3347/9998/00473991.pdf","startPage":"495","endPage":"499 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '94","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1994.473991","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1994.473991","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9998","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=473991","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power control error in a CDMA satellite communication system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Error correction","Multiaccess communication","Satellite communication","Power system modeling","Adaptive systems","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Shadow mapping","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","power control","adaptive control","mobile satellite communication","telecommunication control","land mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive power control","CDMA","satellite communication system","land mobile satellite system","round-trip delay","satellite link","shadowing","uplink","coherent asynchronous system","open-loop power control error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/473991/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Power control error in a CDMA satellite communication system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5050777","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power control error in a CDMA satellite communication system","confLoc":"Fort Monmouth, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00473991.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066111S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","isNumber":"9998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3347","citationCount":"1","articleId":"473991","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":474003,"authors":[{"name":"T.N.

When such networks employ multiple wavelengths, however, some of the most substantial new research challenges are those posed by the amplifier chains themselves. Such networks suffer from accumulating inter-channel power-spread, from sensitivity to inter-amplifier loss variations, and from transient cross-saturation, as the network undergoes reconfiguration. The authors describe two different approaches to address these problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1994.474019","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1994.474019","startPage":"350","endPage":"356 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3347/9998/00474019.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '94","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical amplifiers for WDM systems and networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Optical amplifiers for WDM systems and networks","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 1994","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5050749","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/474019/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical amplifiers for WDM systems and networks","confLoc":"Fort Monmouth, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00474019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055212S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","isNumber":"9998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3347","articleId":"474019","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":474024,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In space communications, as with all space-segment and airborne sensors, size-weight-power platform constraints coupled with the desire or requirement for large element arrays and space-time adaptive processing make fully adaptive array processors unrealizable. The general solution to reducing the degrees of freedom for array processors is addressed from a joint-process point of view using the geometry of least squares to select a lower dimensional subspace for adaptive nulling. It is demonstrated that the subspace selection based on this technique may outperform the principal components method. A tree-structured time-varying filterbank is proposed to provide an adaptive transformation for the subspace selection.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/474025/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5050743","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"A new filterbank-based MMSE approach to reducing the degrees of freedom in adaptive sensor array processing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new filterbank-based MMSE approach to reducing the degrees of freedom in adaptive sensor array processing","confLoc":"Fort Monmouth, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00474025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069399S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","isNumber":"9998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3347","citationCount":"4","articleId":"474025","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":474026,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

Performance results are presented and the optimum operating parameters are specified.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.1994.474051","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICCS '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICCS '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3348/9999/00474051.pdf","startPage":"334","endPage":"337 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.1994.474051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Indoor infrared wireless networks utilising PPM CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=474051","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/474051/","displayDocTitle":"Indoor infrared wireless networks utilising PPM CDMA","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5043976","conferenceDate":"14-18 Nov. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Indoor infrared wireless networks utilising PPM CDMA","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00474051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048153S","chronDate":"14-18 Nov 1994","isNumber":"9999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3348","citationCount":"5","articleId":"474051","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":474052,"authors":[{"name":"X.H.

The GSA is applied in the equalization of signals disturbed by noise and intersymbol interference (ISI) and in the decoding of convolutional codes. For wide trellises it is not useful to implement a Viterbi algorithm (VA), as the complexity of the VA raises exponentially to the width of the trellis. The GSA follows only C paths (with normally C/spl Gt/K), where C is the capacity of the path memory and the complexity of the GSA increases much less than that of the VA. Instead of it, the GSA requires a sorting device, which is rather expensive. Additionally the number of paths varies during the detection process and the paths have different time indices. Extracting and inserting few paths from a more or less sorted path memory disturbs the order only slightly. So we need only little rearranging effort for the path memory. This paper presents a suitable sorting structure for the GSA for a large path number. The structure exploits the inherent parallelism by a new sorting scheme called extended systolic priority queue (ESPQ). It provides a faster sorting than previous designs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.1994.474092","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICCS '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICCS '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3348/9999/00474092.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.1994.474092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9999","startPage":"129","endPage":"133 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An implementation of the generalized stack algorithm using a partially sorting algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=474092","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An implementation of the generalized stack algorithm using a partially sorting algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/474092/","conferenceDate":"14-18 Nov. 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5038568","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An implementation of the generalized stack algorithm using a partially sorting algorithm","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00474092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044508S","chronDate":"14-18 Nov 1994","isNumber":"9999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3348","citationCount":"1","articleId":"474092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":474096,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This scheme improves BER performance for frequency selective fading when the number of simultaneously accessing users in a cellular zone is small.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.1994.474180","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICCS '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICCS '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3348/10000/00474180.pdf","startPage":"612","endPage":"619 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.1994.474180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10000","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonal multi-carrier FH-CDMA scheme for frequency selective fading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=474180","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/474180/","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal multi-carrier FH-CDMA scheme for frequency selective fading","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5038938","conferenceDate":"14-18 Nov. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal multi-carrier FH-CDMA scheme for frequency selective fading","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00474180.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053612S","chronDate":"14-18 Nov 1994","isNumber":"10000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3348","citationCount":"3","articleId":"474180","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":474184,"authors":[{"name":"Shu-Hung Leung","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City Polytechnic of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Shu-Hung Leung","id":"37087261156"},{"name":"Jian-Feng Weng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City Polytechnic of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Jian-Feng Weng","id":"37087260778"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2046-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"474184","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":15},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Intelligent networks","Indoor communication","Multipath channels","Delay effects","Fading","Multiaccess communication","Computer simulation","Artificial neural networks","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","indoor radio","diversity reception","land mobile radio","synchronisation","feedforward neural nets","multilayer perceptrons","probability","signal detection","multipath channels","fading","decision theory","delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","PN synchronization","optimal symbol decision","DS/SS indoor communications","optimal probabilistic decision method","symbol detection","uncertain time delay","multipath fading","receiver movement","radial basis function network","channel coefficients estimation","performance","computer simulation results","Rake diversity reception"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=474184","abstract":"An optimal probabilistic decision method is described for symbol detection in DS/SS indoor communications in the presence of uncertain time delay caused by the receiver's movement and multipath fading.

The highly pipelined systolic array has many features which make it attractive for parallel processing architectures and very large scale integration (VLSI).

Conventional adaptive interference cancellation techniques rely on a training sequence to update the taps of an adaptive filter or decision feedback equaliser (DFE). The strategy proposed in this paper replaces this conventional optimal filtering approach by one based on the principles of adaptive noise cancellation (ANC). As opposed to the conventional optimal filtering approach, the ANC approach exploits the cyclo-stationary properties of the multiple access interference, in order to model the interference generation process. Silent periods (c.f. voice activity factor) can be exploited to derive the interference model. This removes the need for a training sequence and associated system overheads. The scheme employs a conjugate matched filter (CMF) to generate an interference reference input to the adaptive noise canceller. A preliminary investigation of the performance of the proposed scheme is undertaken. The ANC scheme is shown to have a significantly better performance than the conventional receiver and the DFE in the multiple access interference limited environment. It is shown that the scheme can be extended to provide blind interference cancellation in the case of acute near-far conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.1994.474229","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICCS '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICCS '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3348/10000/00474229.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.1994.474229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10000","startPage":"364","endPage":"368 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel interference rejection scheme for DS-CDMA using adaptive noise cancellation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=474229","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel interference rejection scheme for DS-CDMA using adaptive noise cancellation","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/474229/","conferenceDate":"14-18 Nov. 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5038889","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel interference rejection scheme for DS-CDMA using adaptive noise cancellation","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00474229.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036674S","chronDate":"14-18 Nov 1994","isNumber":"10000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3348","citationCount":"1","articleId":"474229","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":474231,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

Immediately thereafter, in 1990, Qualcomm Inc. proposed a spread spectrum digital cellular system, based on code division multiple access (CDMA), which became the second North American interim standard in 1993. The key requirement for the second generation digital cellular system is the achievement of high capacity as compared to the current (first generation) analog FM cellular system, based on frequency division multiple access (FDMA). This paper gives an overview of Qualcomm's CDMA cellular system and its achievement of the second generation cellular system design objectives.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICCS '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3348/10000/00474231.pdf","startPage":"353","endPage":"358 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICCS '94","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.1994.474231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.1994.474231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10000","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=474231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overview of the technical basis of Qualcomm's CDMA cellular telephone system design: a view of North American TIA/EIA IS-95","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Telephony","Time division multiple access","Spread spectrum communication","Frequency division multiaccess","Frequency modulation","Frequency conversion","Jamming","Bandwidth","Communication industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","digital radio","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","telecommunication standards","telephony","code division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDMA cellular telephone system","Qualcomm","North American TIA/EIA IS-95","digital cellular interim standard","time division multiple access","TDMA","Qualcomm Inc","spread spectrum digital cellular system","code division multiple access","CDMA","second generation digital cellular system","high capacity","analog FM cellular system","frequency division multiple access","FDMA","PN modulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/474231/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"Overview of the technical basis of Qualcomm's CDMA cellular telephone system design: a view of North American TIA/EIA IS-95","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5038887","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-18 Nov. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overview of the technical basis of Qualcomm's CDMA cellular telephone system design: a view of North American TIA/EIA IS-95","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00474231.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033817S","chronDate":"14-18 Nov 1994","isNumber":"10000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3348","citationCount":"16","articleId":"474231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":474275,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In this system, the neural network is used to automatically identify radioactive isotopes in real-time from their gamma-ray spectra. Two neural network paradigms are examined: the linear perceptron and the optimal linear associative memory (OLAM). A comparison of the two paradigms shows that OLAM is superior to linear perceptron for this application. Both networks have a linear response and are useful in determining the composition of an unknown sample when the spectrum of the unknown is a linear superposition of known spectra. One feature of this technique is that it uses the whole spectrum in the identification process instead of only the individual photo-peaks. For this reason, it is potentially more useful for processing data from lower resolution gamma-ray spectrometers. This approach has been successfully tested with data generated by Monte Carlo simulations and with field data from both sodium iodide and germanium detectors. With the neural network approach, the intense computation takes place during the training process. Once the network is trained, normal operation consists of propagating the data through the network, which results in rapid identification of samples in the field. This approach is useful in situations that require fast response but where precise quantification is less important.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Oct-5 Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/474365/","accessionNumber":"5038396","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-5 Nov. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Gamma spectral analysis via neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gamma spectral analysis via neural networks","confLoc":"Norfolk, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00474365.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035429S","chronDate":"30 Oct-5 Nov 1994","isNumber":"10002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3349","citationCount":"2","articleId":"474365","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":474504,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The research efforts are aimed at increasing the \"true-positive fraction\" while decreasing the \"false-positive fraction\" of the CADx. Among the problems of decreasing the number of false-positives, the differentiation between nodules and end-on vessels is one of the most challenging tasks performed by computers. Most investigators have used a conventional two-step pattern recognition approach, i.e., feature extraction followed by feature classification, The principal difficulty in those methodologies is in specifying the kind of features which will differentiate nodules from end-on vessels. Unfortunately, suitable feature definition, and corresponding extraction implementation algorithms, proved to be very difficult to define and specify. A convolution neural network (CNN) architecture, trained by direct connection to the raw image is proposed to tackle the problem. The CNN, which used locally responsive activation function, was directly and locally connected to the raw image. The performance of the CNN is evaluated in comparison to an expert radiologist. We employed receiver operating characteristics (ROC) method with A/sub z/ as the performance index to evaluate all the simulation results. The CNN showed superior performance (A/sub z/=0.99) to the radiologist's (A/sub z/=0.83).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Oct-5 Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/474706/","accessionNumber":"5087330","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-5 Nov. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An application of convolution neural networks: reducing false-positives in lung nodule detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An application of convolution neural networks: reducing false-positives in lung nodule detection","confLoc":"Norfolk, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00474706.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040842S","chronDate":"30 Oct-5 Nov 1994","isNumber":"10005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3349","citationCount":"2","articleId":"474706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":474709,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In this preliminary study, we report an application of Hopfield neural network (HNN) for the multispectral unsupervised classification of magnetic resonance (MR) images. We formulate the problem as minimization of an energy function constructed with two terms, the cost-term which is the sum of squares errors, and the second term is a temporary noise added to the cost-term as an excitation to the network to escape from certain local minimums and be close to the global minimum.

The circuit enables zero voltage switching with reduced device stresses for all switches. It provides reduced voltage rate of change du/dt and hence low conducted and radiated emission. The proposed circuit utilizes an auxiliary zero voltage switching circuit (ZVS) which can be triggered on demand, to create a zero-voltage switching interval for the inverter switches, thereby ensuring nearly lossless switching. A new space vector delta modulation is introduced to overcome the problem of the minimum dwell time of switching state required for soft switching. Experimental results from a 50 kVA, 400 V inverter for 3-phase induction motor verified the expected advantages of the novel inverter and of the proposed space vector delta modulation concerning the switching frequency and the output spectrum characteristics. The paper concludes with comparison to the popular space vector modulation for a 3-phase motor drive.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1995.474788","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1995.474788","startPage":"28","endPage":"33 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PESC '95 - Power Electronics Specialist Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/3350/10006/00474788.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PESC '95 - Power Electronics Specialist Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10006","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quasi resonant 3-phase IGBT inverter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Quasi resonant 3-phase IGBT inverter","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 1995","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5044638","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/474788/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quasi resonant 3-phase IGBT inverter","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00474788.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043453S","chronDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","isNumber":"10006","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3350","citationCount":"12","articleId":"474788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":474789,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The MOSFET control circuitry is designed to replicate the basic functionality of a rectifier diode, turning on when the voltage across the device falls to zero, and turning off when the current through the device tries to reverse. This synchronous rectification device can be incorporated into a wide range of converter topologies, without the restrictions imposed on other synchronous rectification schemes. In order to minimize the losses resulting from gate drive timing errors at high switching frequencies (/spl sim/1 MHz), adaptive timing control loops are used to null the inherent delays of the control and driver circuitry. The power FETs and control circuitry are integrated in a 1.2 /spl mu/m CMOS process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronous rectification with adaptive timing control","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PESC '95 - Power Electronics Specialist Conference","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1995.474797","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PESC '95 - Power Electronics Specialist Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/3350/10006/00474797.pdf","startPage":"88","endPage":"95 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1995.474797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10006","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=474797","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/474797/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Synchronous rectification with adaptive timing control","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5044647","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronous rectification with adaptive timing control","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00474797.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045596S","chronDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","isNumber":"10006","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3350","citationCount":"48","articleId":"474797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":474798,"authors":[{"name":"K.M.

The proposed multiloop digital controller consists of a current controller, a voltage controller, and a feedforward controller. This multiloop digital controller was realized using a single-chip digital signal processor (DSP). The PWM gating signals are determined at every sampling instant by the proposed multiloop digital control scheme using a set of detected feedback signals. A software current control scheme has been developed to achieve fast current control of the PWM inverter and decouple the inductor of the output filter. Frequency response behavior of this digital-controlled PWM DC-AC power converter under load variations has been analyzed. The design procedure of the digital controller has been described in detail. Experimental results have been given to verify the proposed digital control scheme.

Thereby, a significant reduction of the ripple of the resulting mains current as compared to the uncoupled case is obtained. Based on the analytical description of the current shapes within a pulse period the dependency on the circuit parameters of the occurring phase displacement of the switching functions of the partial systems is calculated. Furthermore, the effect of an unsymmetry of the power converters on the system behavior is analyzed and the automatic adjustment of the phase shift within a mains period is investigated by digital simulation. The theoretical considerations are verified by measurements on a laboratory model. Finally, the possibility of a substitution of the magnetic coupling of the input inductances of the partial systems by a coupling of the current controls of the power converters is discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10006","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1995.474808","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PESC '95 - Power Electronics Specialist Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PESC '95 - Power Electronics Specialist Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/3350/10006/00474808.pdf","startPage":"164","endPage":"173 vol.1","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1995.474808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-adjusting input current ripple cancellation of coupled parallel connected hysteresis-controlled boost power factor correctors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Self-adjusting input current ripple cancellation of coupled parallel connected hysteresis-controlled boost power factor correctors","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 1995","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5044658","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/474808/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-adjusting input current ripple cancellation of coupled parallel connected hysteresis-controlled boost power factor correctors","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00474808.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077758S","chronDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","isNumber":"10006","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3350","citationCount":"65","articleId":"474808","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":474809,"authors":[{"name":"Zheren Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Zheren Lai","id":"37087346159"},{"name":"K.M.

The series active filter has a small rating-35 kVA which is 4% of the load kVA-and is controlled by a synchronous reference frame (SRF) based controller. The hybrid series active filter system is controlled to act as a \"harmonic isolator\" between the supply and load. This paper discusses the SRF controller implementation issues, design considerations of the series coupling transformer and protection issues of the small rating series active filter inverter. Operation of the series active filter under off-tuned passive filter conditions is investigated. The effectiveness of the series active filter to provide harmonic damping and the use of simpler and low cost passive filter structures such as power factor correction capacitors is demonstrated by laboratory experimental results. Field installation results demonstrate the practical and economic viability of hybrid series active filter systems for harmonic compensation of large nonlinear loads to comply with IEEE 519 recommended harmonic standards.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1995.474811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10006","startPage":"189","endPage":"195 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PESC '95 - Power Electronics Specialist Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/3350/10006/00474811.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and implementation of a hybrid series active filter system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/474811/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Design and implementation of a hybrid series active filter system","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 1995","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5044661","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and implementation of a hybrid series active filter system","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00474811.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038934S","chronDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","isNumber":"10006","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3350","citationCount":"54","articleId":"474811","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":474818,"authors":[{"name":"N.H.

For an electric vehicle with a battery capacity of 30 kWh, a fifteen minute charge requires 120 kW charging power. Inductive charging offers a safe and convenient means to accomplish this task. This paper investigates the design criteria of the high power converter for a 120 kW inductive battery charger. Since IGBTs are the devices of choice at this power level, the impact of IGBT losses on the converter design and topology selection is investigated. A comparison between a zero voltage switching and a zero current switching series resonant converter is presented and a final topology selection is made. An experimental 120 kW/75 kHz unit was built and tested in the laboratory to verify the results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/474818/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5044668","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design considerations and topology selection for a 120 kW IGBT converter for EV fast charging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design considerations and topology selection for a 120 kW IGBT converter for EV fast charging","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00474818.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0326S","chronDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","isNumber":"10006","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3350","citationCount":"22","articleId":"474818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":474828,"authors":[{"name":"S.Y.R.

This new UPS is based on the combination of two full-bridge VSI power converters: one in series with the input; and the other in parallel with the load. The UPS acts as a line conditioner and output voltage stabilizer in the presence of input power while charging the battery at a controlled rate. In the case of loss of input power, the UPS can make a seamless transition to backup mode while supplying the load with a controlled sinusoidal voltage; drawing power from the battery. The series power converter sees only a small percentage of the input voltage (typically 10-20%) while carrying the input current and therefore has a small kVA rating. The parallel power converter supplies the load during blackout and hence determines the total kVA rating of the UPS. The reduced kVA rating of the series power converter results in reduced system cost compared to conventional online systems without sacrificing any desirable characteristics. A laboratory version of the proposed UPS has been built to demonstrate the claimed capabilities and both simulation and experimental results are included in the paper.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1995.474856","pdfPath":"/iel2/3350/10006/00474856.pdf","startPage":"500","endPage":"506 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PESC '95 - Power Electronics Specialist Conference","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PESC '95 - Power Electronics Specialist Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1995.474856","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10006","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel on-line UPS with universal filtering capabilities","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/474856/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"A novel on-line UPS with universal filtering capabilities","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5057895","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel on-line UPS with universal filtering capabilities","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00474856.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035747S","chronDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","isNumber":"10006","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3350","citationCount":"21","articleId":"474856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":474857,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

These types of inverter are often used in uninterruptable power supplies (UPS) where a sine wave output voltage is to be maintained. Output voltage control is structured around an inner filter capacitor current loop where capacitor current is sensed via a single, small current transformer. This avoids the expense of multiple, active current sensors found in alternative designs. Performance of the capacitor current loop is enhanced with active decoupling of both the DC bus and the equivalent \"back-EMF\" of the output voltage. The output dynamic stiffness of the system is analyzed and plotted. Experimental results yield less than 0.5% total harmonic distortion (THD) at full load (8 kW), with transient response times of less than 200 /spl mu/s.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1995.474857","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PESC '95 - Power Electronics Specialist Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PESC '95 - Power Electronics Specialist Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/3350/10006/00474857.pdf","startPage":"507","endPage":"513 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1995.474857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10006","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high performance sine wave inverter controller with capacitor current feedback and \"back-EMF\" decoupling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=474857","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/474857/","displayDocTitle":"A high performance sine wave inverter controller with capacitor current feedback and \"back-EMF\" decoupling","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5057896","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high performance sine wave inverter controller with capacitor current feedback and \"back-EMF\" decoupling","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00474857.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029009S","chronDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","isNumber":"10006","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3350","citationCount":"88","articleId":"474857","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":474859,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Increase in utility voltage causes a VSC to saturate and enter a nonlinear mode of operation. A PWM algorithm is implemented which extends the linear region of operation by 15% and reduces commutation losses by 33%. In addition, a current regulator is implemented to control the reactive current of the VSC under normal and elevated utility voltage. The results of analysis are experimentally verified on a 100 kW three phase voltage source converter.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel2/3350/10006/00474859.pdf","startPage":"523","endPage":"528 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PESC '95 - Power Electronics Specialist Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10006","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1995.474859","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1995.474859","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PESC '95 - Power Electronics Specialist Conference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=474859","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Converters","Power conversion","Pulse width modulation","Reactive power","Voltage control","Drives","Regulators","Harmonic distortion","Load flow","Equivalent circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM power convertors","power system harmonics","harmonic distortion","network analysis","circuit testing","commutation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voltage source power converter","regeneration capability","controllable power factor","low distortion","increased utility voltage","saturation","nonlinear operation mode","PWM algorithm","commutation losses","current regulator","reactive current control","three phase","100 kW"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/474859/","displayDocTitle":"Operation of a voltage source converter at increased utility voltage","accessionNumber":"5057898","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 1995","volume":"1","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Operation of a voltage source converter at increased utility voltage","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00474859.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02897S","chronDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","isNumber":"10006","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3350","citationCount":"10","articleId":"474859","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":474864,"authors":[{"name":"R.

However, the operating speed range in most of these applications is very limited due to the difficulty of achieving field weakening in most PM structures. This difficulty is one of the major stumbling blocks to widespread application of PM machines. A new doubly salient PM motor topology is proposed in this paper which offers the possibility of low cost, high performance and robust realization of field adjustment. It is shown that by controlling the field winding, 100% field weakening and 2 p.u. torque capability can be achieved without sacrificing other performance characteristics of the machine. Hence, machines of good efficiency throughout a field weakened speed range exceeding five to one can be readily devised. This feature makes this new motor a potential candidate in future motor drive systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1995.474865","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PESC '95 - Power Electronics Specialist Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PESC '95 - Power Electronics Specialist Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/3350/10006/00474865.pdf","startPage":"565","endPage":"571 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1995.474865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10006","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A doubly salient permanent magnet motor capable of field weakening","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=474865","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/474865/","displayDocTitle":"A doubly salient permanent magnet motor capable of field weakening","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5057904","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A doubly salient permanent magnet motor capable of field weakening","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00474865.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026867S","chronDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","isNumber":"10006","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3350","citationCount":"54","articleId":"474865","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":474867,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Multilevel voltage-source converters have a voltage unbalance problem in the DC capacitors. The problem may be solved by use of additional voltage regulators or separate DC sources. However, these solutions are found not to be practicable for most applications. The proposed converter system can solve the voltage unbalance problem of the conventional multilevel voltage-source converters, without using any additional voltage balance circuits or separate voltage sources. The mechanism of the voltage unbalance problem is analyzed theoretically in this paper. The voltage unbalance problem of multilevel converters in the DC capacitors has been solved by the proposed internal connections of the AC/DC and DC/AC converters.

It utilizes inductors in series with the main switches to limit di/dt during turn on, while the inductor energy is recovered by a resonant turn off process, which is allowed by the presence of two auxiliary switches. As inductive di/dt snubbers are usually needed in high-power GTO power converters, the proposed topology offers a solution to the problem of snubber energy recovery. The control strategy explained in the paper allows both full-range PWM and minimization of stresses during the resonant commutation process. Results of a theoretical analysis and design criteria are reported in the paper. Examples of PWM control schemes are also described, both for analog (ramp-comparison based) and digital (space-vector based) implementations.

Particular care is devoted to the analysis of the well-posedness of the problem and to the avoidance of stagnation points which can trap the algorithm away from the true solution. The effectiveness of the method and its superior performance with respect to the commonly used successive projections algorithms are demonstrated by a numerical analysis.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Optical surface waves","Phase measurement","Reflector antennas","Distortion measurement","Aperture antennas","Projection algorithms","Numerical analysis","Thermal degradation","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reflector antennas","antenna radiation patterns","numerical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shaped beam antenna","reflector distortions diagnosis","deformations","reflector antenna surface","radiated far-field amplitude pattern","factorization","aperture-field distribution","undistorted antenna","measurement accuracy","performance","numerical analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/8.475093","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/10011/00475093.pdf","startPage":"1217","endPage":"1225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.475093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reflector distortions diagnosis from far-field amplitude pattern","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=475093","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reflector distortions diagnosis from far-field amplitude pattern","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/475093/","volume":"43","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5128138","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reflector distortions diagnosis from far-field amplitude pattern","sourcePdf":"00475093.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046943S","chronDate":"Nov 1995","isNumber":"10011","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"4","articleId":"475093","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":475095,"authors":[{"name":"Changhua Wan","affiliation":["E.

The technique is based on a spectral domain moment method, but assuming multiple incident Floquet-harmonics and computing the GSM directly. Also, some symmetry properties are exploited, and the whole GSM is computed with similar computer effort as that required for a single scattering coefficient. The technique has been applied to the analysis of periodic surfaces involving rectangular and arbitrarily-shaped metallizations using entire- and sub-domain basis functions, respectively. Losses in both dielectric layers and metallizations have been included in the formulation. Multilayered periodic structures are analyzed in a very flexible and efficient way by cascading iteratively the GSM of each interface with or without metallizations considered as building blocks. Numerical results have been provided for different multilayered structures, and a good agreement with other experimental and theoretical data has been obtained.

A linearly constrained minimum power algorithm incorporating both main beam and derivative constraints is formulated and simulated. The nulling resolution of the multiple-aperture MBA is shown to be superior to that of the single-aperture MBA. In addition, a method for illuminating a region in space with constant gain while simultaneously nulling interfering signals within a fractional single element beamwidth of this constant gain region is illustrated. A flat gain pattern is achieved by spacing derivative constraints over the spatial region where the desired signals are known to be transmitting. Derivative constraints are particularly useful when the precise directions of arrival for the desired signals are not available to the beamformer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.475106","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/10011/00475106.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.475106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10011","startPage":"1319","endPage":"1324","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A nulling performance comparison between a single- and multiple-aperture multiple-beam antenna","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=475106","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A nulling performance comparison between a single- and multiple-aperture multiple-beam antenna","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/475106/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","accessionNumber":"5128150","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A nulling performance comparison between a single- and multiple-aperture multiple-beam antenna","sourcePdf":"00475106.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085183S","chronDate":"Nov 1995","isNumber":"10011","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"3","articleId":"475106","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":475112,"authors":[{"name":"E.F.

The bandwidth can be expanded even more by imposing different design criteria.

The routing or the interconnect delays are determined by the length of segments assigned to the nets of various lengths and the number of PIs programmed for routing of each net. Due to the use of PIs certain unconventional faults may appear. In this paper we model the PI faults and address the design and routability of the FPGA channel architecture to achieve 100% routing with minimum performance penalty in the presence of PI faults. A channel routing algorithm has also been developed which routes nets in the presence of PI faults. Experiments were performed by randomly injecting faults of different types into the routing channel and then using the routing algorithm to determine the routability of the synthesized architecture. Results on a set of industrial designs and MCNC benchmark examples show the feasibility of achieving routability with minimum performance penalty when a large number of faults are present in the channel.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/475125/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","accessionNumber":"5134816","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"44","issue":"11","displayDocTitle":"On routability for FPGAs under faulty conditions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On routability for FPGAs under faulty conditions","sourcePdf":"00475125.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038841S","chronDate":"Nov 1995","isNumber":"10012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"26","articleId":"475125","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":475127,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The addressing requirements of the new storage technique are also discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/10012/00475134.pdf","startPage":"1352","endPage":"1356","doi":"10.1109/12.475134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.475134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementing multiplication with split read-only memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/475134/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1995","displayDocTitle":"Implementing multiplication with split read-only memory","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5141077","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementing multiplication with split read-only memory","sourcePdf":"00475134.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051205S","chronDate":"Nov 1995","isNumber":"10012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"11","articleId":"475134","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":475139,"authors":[{"name":"A.G.

The method is based on the hypothesis \"sampler kick-out equals oscilloscope impulse response\". This hypothesis was originally based on an intuitive approach and was later verified experimentally (comparison with power measurements) as well as with SPICE simulations. Until now, however, there was no generalized mathematical evidence supporting this basic hypothesis. In this paper a mathematical theory is developed, which starts from a generalized sampler equivalent scheme, and which shows that, under conditions which are valid in practice, the sampler kick-out indeed equals the sampler impulse response. Experimental results are reported concerning the accuracy and precision of the calibration procedure. These experiments involve the investigation of experiment repeatability, noise, sampler linearity and timebase effects.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/475144/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","accessionNumber":"5128160","volume":"44","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Broadband sampling oscilloscope characterization with the \"Nose-to-Nose\" calibration procedure: a theoretical and practical analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadband sampling oscilloscope characterization with the \"Nose-to-Nose\" calibration procedure: a theoretical and practical analysis","sourcePdf":"00475144.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023801S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"51","articleId":"475144","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":475145,"authors":[{"name":"A.N.

The validity of the derived design is investigated in terms of the band selectivity of the nonuniform filters, the alias cancellation among the nonuniform analysis and synthesis filters, and the distortion function of the overall filter bank. The investigations are done in a rigorous manner via three proved properties, which provide the criterion that the proposed design method is applicable if, and only if, the upper band edge frequency of each nonuniform filter is an integral multiple of the bandwidth of the corresponding band.

In this paper the performance of a multicarrier transmission technique, the well-known orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) method, is analysed and the system parameters for the DTVB application are considered. A multilevel differential modulation technique, the so-called differential amplitude and phase shift keying (64-DAPSK) is proposed, in which the phase and the amplitude are used simultaneously for differential modulation. A differential modulation technique does not require any explicit knowledge about the radio channel properties in the differential channel equalization process. In an OFDM/64-DAPSK receiver it is therefore not necessary to implement a channel estimation and a frequency-domain equalizer, which reduces the computation complexity. The performance of both modulation techniques has been analysed in the uncoded case referring to Gaussian and frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels. The results are described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IBC 95 International Broadcasting Convention","pdfPath":"/iel3/3354/10022/00475393.pdf","startPage":"102","endPage":"108","publicationTitle":"IBC 95 International Broadcasting Convention","doi":"10.1049/cp:19950937","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:19950937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10022","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=475393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential amplitude phase shift keying (DAPSK)-a new modulation method for DTVB","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Amplitude shift keying","Differential phase shift keying","Digital TV","Fading channels","Frequency division multiplexing","Gaussian channels","TV broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","differential phase shift keying","digital television","fading","frequency division multiplexing","Gaussian channels","television broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential amplitude phase shift keying","AWGN channel","source coding","digital terrestrial video broadcasting","DTVB","high data rate","single radio channel","bandwidth","multicarrier transmission","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","system parameters","multilevel differential modulation","64-DAPSK","differential modulation","differential channel equalization","OFDM/64-DAPSK receiver","uncoded case","frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels","34.368 Mbit/s","7 MHz","8 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/475393/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Differential amplitude phase shift keying (DAPSK)-a new modulation method for DTVB","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5028160","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-18 Sept. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential amplitude phase shift keying (DAPSK)-a new modulation method for DTVB","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00475393.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023719S","chronDate":"14-18 Sep 1995","isNumber":"10022","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3354","citationCount":"48","articleId":"475393","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":475396,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The structure of the CD3-OFDM demodulator is described, based on a new channel estimation loop exploiting the error correction capability of a forward error correction (FEC) decoder and frequency and time domain filtering to mitigate the effects of noise and residual errors. In contrast to the conventional coherent OFDM demodulation schemes, CD3-OFDM does not require the transmission of a comb of pilot tones for channel estimation and equalisation, therefore yielding a significant improvement in spectrum efficiency (typically between 5% and 15%). The performance of the system with QPSK and 64 QAM modulations is analysed by computer simulations, on AWGN and frequency selective channels. The results indicate that CD3-OFDM allows to achieve C/N performance similar to coherent demodulation with pilot tones, when the same channel coding and modulation scheme is adopted. Otherwise, when the additional capacity is exploited to increase the FEC redundancy instead of the useful bit-rate, CD3 can offer significant C/N advantages (typically from 2 to 5 dB depending on the channel characteristics). Therefore CD3-OFDM can be suitable for digital television broadcasting services over selective radio channels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Sep 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/475396/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5028163","conferenceDate":"14-18 Sept. 1995","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"CD3-OFDM: a new channel estimation method to improve the spectrum efficiency in digital terrestrial television systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CD3-OFDM: a new channel estimation method to improve the spectrum efficiency in digital terrestrial television systems","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00475396.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040629S","chronDate":"14-18 Sep 1995","isNumber":"10022","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3354","citationCount":"8","articleId":"475396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":475445,"authors":[{"name":"K.

As such, it includes consistent descriptions of electromagnetic phenomena occurring on power systems. The document also presents definitions of nominal conditions and of deviations from these nominal conditions, which may originate within the source of supply or load equipment, or from interactions between the source and the load. Brief, generic descriptions of load susceptibility to deviations from nominal conditions are presented to identify which deviations may be of interest. Also, this document presents recommendations for measurement techniques, application techniques, and interpretation of monitoring results so that comparable results from monitoring surveys performed with different instruments can be correlated. While theree is no implied limitation on the voltage rating of the power system being monitored, signal inputs to the instruments are limited to 1000 Vac rms or less. The frequency ratings of the ac power systems being monitored are in the range of 45\u00e2\u20ac\u201c450 Hz. Although it is recognized that the instruments may also be used for monitoring dc supply systems or data transmission systems, details of application to these special cases are under consideration and are not included in the scope. It is also recognized that the instruments may perform monitoring functions for environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, high frequency electromagnetic radiation); however, the scope of this document is limited to conducted electrical parameters derived from voltage or current measurements, or both. Finally, the definitions are solely intended to characterize common electromagnetic phenomena to facilitate communication between various sectors of the power quality community.

The speed control method which has better control response than a typical one in command following, torsional vibration suppression, disturbance rejection, and robustness to parameter variation, was proposed. The performance of command following, torsional vibration suppression, and robustness to parameter variation was satisfied by using a Kalman filter and LQ based speed control with an integrator. Also, disturbance rejection performance was improved through load torque compensation.

The magnitude of this pressure varies as the inverse fourth power of the separation between the plates. At a 20 nm separation between two metallic plates, the attraction is approximately 0.08 atmosphere. If one or both plates are nonconducting the pressure is smaller, roughly by an order of magnitude. As an idealized MEMS component that takes account of the Casimir effect, the anharmonic Casimir oscillator (ACO) is introduced and shown to be a bi-stable system for certain values of the dimensionless parameter, C, which characterizes the system. The phenomenon of \"stiction\" in MEMS is then explained as analogous to an ACO energetically descending to and settling in an equilibrium state that is very stable against perturbations for all values of C. A micromechanical switch based on the bistable ACO is proposed and modeled. The dynamics of an ACO, executing undamped periodic motion, are studied using numerical and analytical solutions of the differential equation of motion. Frequencies and amplitudes vary with C. C, in turn, is inversely proportional to the fifth power of the parallel plate separation. This extreme sensitivity makes the ACO an attractive platform for designing rather sensitive sensors and detector systems, such as submicrometer proximity sensors and microlever deflection detectors for scanning probe microscopes.","doi":"10.1109/84.475546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/84.475546","endPage":"205","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/84/10181/00475546.pdf","startPage":"193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The anharmonic Casimir oscillator (ACO)-the Casimir effect in a model microelectromechanical system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/475546/","displayDocTitle":"The anharmonic Casimir oscillator (ACO)-the Casimir effect in a model microelectromechanical system","volume":"4","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"5167886","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The anharmonic Casimir oscillator (ACO)-the Casimir effect in a model microelectromechanical system","sourcePdf":"00475546.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053492S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"8","articleId":"475546","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":475547,"authors":[{"name":"R.H.

A multiple coating process is developed to obtain a photoresist thickness up to 23 /spl mu/m while maintaining a smooth photoresist surface. Intimate contact between the mask and wafer is found to be most critical for high-resolution photolithography. Vacuum contact is found to be well-suited for this purpose. Additionally, edge bead removal is found to be of significant importance for intimate contact between the mask and the substrate. Prebake, exposure, and development conditions are optimized for resolution and aspect ratio. Maximum prebake temperature still allowing the photoresist to be developed is found to be the optimal temperature for obtaining high resolution. Prebake time distribution is optimized for avoiding residual stress in the photoresist, as well as maintaining high resolution, when multiple coating is applied. Minimum linewidth and spacing of 3.5 /spl mu/m and 2.5 /spl mu/m, respectively, and a maximum aspect ratio of 7.7 have been achieved in a photoresist thickness of 23 /spl mu/m. Postbake improves the chemical resistance to subsequent processes, for example, electroless nickel plating using the photoresist as a mold. However, postbake also causes pattern distortion, which can be severe at times. Therefore, optimal process and design conditions for minimizing the pattern distortion have been studied.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/84/10181/00475549.pdf","startPage":"220","endPage":"229","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","doi":"10.1109/84.475549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/84.475549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10181","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=475549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-aspect-ratio photolithography for MEMS applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lithography","Micromechanical devices","Resists","Coatings","Temperature","Light sources","Residual stresses","Chemical processes","Nickel","Process design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["photolithography","micromechanical devices","semiconductor technology","masks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aspect-ratio","photolithography","MEMS applications","positive photoresist","contact mask aligner","UV light source","multiple coating process","photoresist thickness","vacuum contact","edge bead removal","prebake conditions","exposure conditions","development conditions","resolution","residual stress","multiple coating","chemical resistance","pattern distortion","3.5 micron","2.5 micron","23 micron"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/475549/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","displayDocTitle":"High-aspect-ratio photolithography for MEMS applications","volume":"4","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","accessionNumber":"5167889","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-aspect-ratio photolithography for MEMS applications","sourcePdf":"00475549.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038117S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"73","articleId":"475549","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":475550,"authors":[{"name":"T.S.

This model can also be used with other types of piezoelectric actuators with a slight modification.","doi":"10.1109/84.475550","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/84/10181/00475550.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/84.475550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10181","startPage":"230","endPage":"237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of a three-layer piezoelectric bimorph beam with hysteresis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=475550","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of a three-layer piezoelectric bimorph beam with hysteresis","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/475550/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","accessionNumber":"5167890","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of a three-layer piezoelectric bimorph beam with hysteresis","sourcePdf":"00475550.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0367S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"231","articleId":"475550","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":475560,"authors":[{"name":"K.A.

In the electrical circuit region, the coplanar waveguides (CPW) are prepared on a thick-silica/silicon substrate. This structure reduces the propagation loss of the CPW drastically to 2.7 dB/cm at 10 GHz, because the loss tangent (tan /spl delta/) of the dielectric constants of silica is much smaller than that of silicon. In order to study the feasibility of this PLC-platform for multi-gigabit operation, we used it to fabricate an LD module in which an LD chip and LD-driver integrated circuits (IC) are assembled on the PLC-platform. A bit error rate measurement of this LD module in a 2.5 Gb/s NRZ showed that this platform is applicable to multi-gigabit optical signal processing.","doi":"10.1109/50.475570","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/10182/00475570.pdf","startPage":"2320","endPage":"2326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.475570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10182","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=475570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Planar lightwave circuit platform with coplanar waveguide for opto-electronic hybrid integration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Planar lightwave circuit platform with coplanar waveguide for opto-electronic hybrid integration","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/475570/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","volume":"13","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","accessionNumber":"5164968","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Planar lightwave circuit platform with coplanar waveguide for opto-electronic hybrid integration","sourcePdf":"00475570.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041196S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"19","articleId":"475570","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":475612,"authors":[{"name":"E.C.

This makes it vital that engineering students have a good understanding of the fundamentals of the subject and a practical appreciation of the possibilities it offers. However, DSP is mathematically demanding and this makes it difficult for students to follow the subject. This paper discusses a practical approach we have adopted in Plymouth to the teaching of DSP. This has proved effective in giving the student a perceptive understanding of the fundamentals of DSP and a good appreciation of the power and versatility of DSP processors. An important part of our teaching is a set of stand-alone DSP hardware, developed in house, which have provided useful and inexpensive platforms for demonstrating simple DSP algorithms in real-time and to support final year degree project work. Case studies are used to explore real world problems and the interactions between DSP and other technologies, such as artificial neural networks and satellite communications.","doi":"10.1049/ic:19950210","publicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Teaching of Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Teaching of Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/3379/10045/00475612.pdf","startPage":"6/1","endPage":"6/8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/ic:19950210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10045","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A practical approach to digital signal processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=475612","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"16 Feb 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/475612/","displayDocTitle":"A practical approach to digital signal processing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"4946626","conferenceDate":"16-16 Feb. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A practical approach to digital signal processing","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00475612.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028243S","chronDate":"16 Feb 1995","isNumber":"10045","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3379","citationCount":"28","articleId":"475612","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":475633,"authors":[{"name":"Ji Li","affiliation":["POLY GRAMES Research Center, E\u00e9cole Ploytechnique, Montreal, Canada"],"lastName":"Ji Li","id":"37292377700"},{"name":"R.G.

Instead of waiting for upfront EM analyses at several base points, our new approach aggressively exploits every available EM analysis, producing dramatic results right from the first step. We establish a relationship between the novel SM optimization and the quasi-Newton iteration for solving a system of nonlinear equations. Approximations to the matrix of first-order derivatives are updated by the classic Broyden formula. A high-temperature superconducting microstrip filter design solution emerges after only six EM simulations with sparse frequency sweeps. Furthermore, less CPU effort is required to optimize the filter than is required by one single detailed frequency sweep. We also extend the SM concept to the parameter extraction phase, overcoming severely misaligned responses induced by inadequate empirical models. This novel concept should have a significant impact on parameter extraction of devices.","doi":"10.1109/22.475649","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/10138/00475649.pdf","startPage":"2874","endPage":"2882","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.475649","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electromagnetic optimization exploiting aggressive space mapping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=475649","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/475649/","displayDocTitle":"Electromagnetic optimization exploiting aggressive space mapping","volume":"43","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","accessionNumber":"5179699","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electromagnetic optimization exploiting aggressive space mapping","sourcePdf":"00475649.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039015S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"263","articleId":"475649","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":475654,"authors":[{"name":"W.A.

This amplifier achieves a Gain/NF.P/sub dc/ ratio figure of merit of 2.10 (1/mW) which is the highest reported at S-band. Under low dc power bias of 2 V and 0.46 mA (0.92 mW), the amplifier achieves 5.2 dB gain, 3.01 dB noise figure and a Gain/P/sub dc/ figure of merit of 5.65 (dB/mW) which is also the highest reported in this frequency band. In addition, a 2-stage self-biased C-band LNA which achieves a minimum noise figure of 2.4 dB at 5 GHz, 16.2 dB gain, with only 72 mW of dc power was also demonstrated. This is believed to be the lowest noise figure performance so far reported for an HBT amplifier above 3 GHz.

The algorithm is verified through implementation of a 2 kVA experimental matrix converter driving a standard induction motor as a load. The switching frequency is 20 kHz. The modulator is implemented with a digital signal processor. The resultant output voltages and input currents are sinusoidal, practically without low-frequency harmonics.

It is determined that the inverter system generates considerable impulse currents through the power leads feeding the system resulting in serious conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI) problems and significant voltage waveform distortion in the power system. The dominant emission sources in the system are identified. A proposed model of the drive system for the purpose of evaluation of EMI are developed. Several low-cost strategies for improvement in EMC performance of the PWM inverter are then proposed.

This architecture also eliminates the timing margin between the activation of column selection lines, reducing the cycle time by 25%.

Several techniques to achieve low retention current, including a relaxed junction biasing (RTB) scheme, a plate-floating leakage-monitoring (PFM) system, and a V/sub BB/ pull-down word-line driver (PDWD) are described. An extension of data-retention time by three-fold and the refresh timer period by 30-fold over previously reported self-refresh DRAMs has been achieved. This results in a reduction of the ac refresh-current to less than 0.4 /spl mu/A per megabyte. Furthermore, the addition of a gate-received V/sub BB/ detector (GRD) reduces dc retention current to less than 0.1 /spl mu/A per megabyte.

High clock speed was obtained by the use of delayed reset logic, a new register file design; and novel comparators. Strict design methodology allowed fully functional first silicon which met all speed targets.

Since a multiple-valued source-coupled logic circuit with dual-rail complementary inputs results in a small signal-voltage swing while providing a constant driving current, the switching speed of the circuit is improved at low supply voltage. As an application to arithmetic systems, a 200 MHz 54/spl times/51-b pipelined multiplier using the proposed circuits with a 1.5 V supply voltage is designed with a 0.8-/spl mu/m standard CMOS technology. The performance of the proposed multiplier is evaluated to be about 1.4 times faster than that of a corresponding binary implementation under the normalized power dissipation.

Electrical power for the plant and field is provided by a small electric cooperative which serves and meters the facility at 69 kV. In addition, gas powered turbines provide cogenerated power.

The determination of the characteristic impedance of these lines is essentially an electrostatic problem and its solution has involved a number of methods, including conformal transformation, finite elements, finite differences and integral equations. Another method is developed here for this problem, employing known field matching means as applied to eccentric geometries. This method is believed to be less involved and easier to use. Comparisons with known experimental and calculated results for rectangular eccentric lines and for strip lines have shown good agreement.

A major contribution of this research is that physical analysis of the system nonlinearities and optimal control are used to design the neural network structure. Network sizing and initializing problems are thus eliminated. This physically meaningful, modular approach facilitates the integration of this neural network with existing controllers; thus, initial performance matches that of existing control approaches and then is improved by refining the parameter estimates via further learning. The neural network operates by recognizing backlash and switching to a control which moves smoothly through the backlash when the torque transmitted to the output shaft must be reversed.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/10141/00475744.pdf","startPage":"1475","endPage":"1483","doi":"10.1109/28.475744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.475744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network compensation of gear backlash hysteresis in position-controlled mechanisms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/475744/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1995","displayDocTitle":"Neural network compensation of gear backlash hysteresis in position-controlled mechanisms","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5165530","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network compensation of gear backlash hysteresis in position-controlled mechanisms","sourcePdf":"00475744.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036352S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1995","isNumber":"10141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"65","articleId":"475744","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":475745,"authors":[{"name":"G.E.

The change in RIN in the temperature range -10/spl deg/C to +60/spl deg/C was less than that due to back reflections, suggesting that error-free QPSK transmission can be acheived over a large temperature range with these DFB lasers.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/10184/00475801.pdf","startPage":"127","endPage":"129","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doi":"10.1109/68.475801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.475801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10184","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=475801","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission of QPSK signals using unisolated DFB lasers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature phase shift keying","Laser noise","Optical reflection","Acoustic reflection","Temperature distribution","Bit error rate","Testing","Packaging","Noise measurement","Laser transitions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed feedback lasers","semiconductor lasers","quadrature phase shift keying","laser noise","semiconductor device noise","light reflection","optical fibre communication","optical modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QPSK signal transmission","unisolated DFB lasers","uncooled lasers","QPSK transmission system","BER measurements","analog tests","commercial DFB lasers","cylindrical packages","error-free transmission","back reflections","laser relative intensity noise","back reflection","temperature","temperature range","error-free QPSK transmission","arge temperature range","1.3 mum","-10 to 60 C"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/475801/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1996","displayDocTitle":"Transmission of QPSK signals using unisolated DFB lasers","volume":"8","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1996","accessionNumber":"5167296","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission of QPSK signals using unisolated DFB lasers","sourcePdf":"00475801.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027185S","chronDate":"Jan.  1996","isNumber":"10184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"5","articleId":"475801","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":475803,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

For direct detection of evenly spaced frequency channels, coherent beating between signal and inter-modulation products occurs when the channel bit rate is greater than the laser linewidth. Crosstalk and maximum input power limitations for an FSK/DD system are calculated for up to 100 channels and channel spacing up to 100 GHz. It is shown that the spectral hole burning and dynamic carrier heating gain mechanisms must be included in addition to carrier modulation and gain saturation to accurately predict both incoherent and coherent crosstalk for channel spacing greater than 5 GHz. Degradation of the eye pattern due to coherent crosstalk is shown to exceed the incoherent contributions by up to 33 dB even when laser phase statistics and bit pattern statistics are accounted for. The result of this crosstalk mechanism is a predicted decrease in the maximum input power per channel to -43 dBm for 100 channels at 100 GHz channel spacing and -52 dBm for 100 channels at 5-GHz channel spacing for an optical SNR of 23 dB, representing a decrease in input power per channel of 25 dBm over incoherent crosstalk limitations alone.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/475803/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1996","accessionNumber":"5167298","volume":"8","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Coherent crosstalk in multichannel FSK/DD lightwave systems due to four-wave mixing in semiconductor optical amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent crosstalk in multichannel FSK/DD lightwave systems due to four-wave mixing in semiconductor optical amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00475803.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040188S","chronDate":"Jan.  1996","isNumber":"10184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"4","articleId":"475803","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":475804,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Similar to Donoho (1995) and Donohoe and Johnstone (1994, 1995), the authors employ thresholding in the wavelet transform domain but, following a suggestion by Coifman, they use an undecimated, shift-invariant, nonorthogonal wavelet transform instead of the usual orthogonal one. This new approach can be interpreted as a repeated application of the original Donoho and Johnstone method for different shifts. The main feature of the new algorithm is a significantly improved noise reduction compared to the original wavelet based approach. This holds for a large class of signals, both visually and in the l/sub 2/ sense, and is shown theoretically as well as by experimental results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/97/10187/00475823.pdf","startPage":"10","endPage":"12","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/97.475823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/97.475823","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10187","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=475823","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise reduction using an undecimated discrete wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Noise reduction","Wavelet domain","Signal to noise ratio","Additive white noise","Nuclear magnetic resonance","Inverse problems","Data compression","Signal resolution","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","transforms","wavelet transforms","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear noise reduction method","undecimated discrete wavelet transform","thresholding","shift-invariant nonorthogonal wavelet transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/475823/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1996","displayDocTitle":"Noise reduction using an undecimated discrete wavelet transform","volume":"3","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1996","accessionNumber":"5178273","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise reduction using an undecimated discrete wavelet transform","sourcePdf":"00475823.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066459S","chronDate":"Jan.  1996","isNumber":"10187","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"322","articleId":"475823","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":475830,"authors":[{"name":"S.-A.

These computed parameters constitute a learning data base for a multilayer ANN structure which is successfully trained using the backpropagation algorithm.

Performance of the code is shown, and the computer-time usage for various parts of the code is given. On a 32 processor CM-5, the core FDTD algorithm is 100 times faster than an existing serial code, run on a SUN SPARC-2 workstation, and the calculation of the radiation patterns for two orthogonal planes is approximately 27 times faster.

In this paper, a perceptually tuned subband image coding scheme is presented, where a just-noticeable distortion (JND) or minimally noticeable distortion (MND) profile is employed to quantify the perceptual redundancy. The JND profile provides each signal being coded with a visibility threshold of distortion, below which reconstruction errors are rendered imperceptible. Based on a perceptual model that incorporates the threshold sensitivities due to background luminance and texture masking effect, the JND profile is estimated from analyzing local properties of image signals. According to the sensitivity of human visual perception to spatial frequencies, the full-band JND/MND profile is decomposed into component JND/MND profiles of different frequency subbands. With these component profiles, perceptually insignificant signals in each subband can be screened out, and significant signals can be properly encoded to meet the visibility threshold. A new quantitative fidelity measure, termed as peak signal-to-perceptible-noise ratio (PSPNR), is proposed to assess the quality of the compressed image by taking the perceptible part of the distortion into account. Simulation results show that near-transparent image coding can be achieved at less than 0.4 b/pixel. As compared to the ISO-JPEG standard, the proposed algorithm can remove more perceptual redundancy from the original image, and the visual quality of the reconstructed image is much more acceptable at low bit rates.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.475889","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10143","startPage":"467","endPage":"476","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/10143/00475889.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A perceptually tuned subband image coder based on the measure of just-noticeable-distortion profile","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/475889/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A perceptually tuned subband image coder based on the measure of just-noticeable-distortion profile","publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","accessionNumber":"5174847","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A perceptually tuned subband image coder based on the measure of just-noticeable-distortion profile","sourcePdf":"00475889.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03999S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"444","articleId":"475889","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":475890,"authors":[{"name":"G.

This paper proposes a method for producing higher quality reconstructed images based on a stochastic model for the image data. Quantization (scalar or vector) partitions the transform coefficient space and maps all points in a partition cell to a representative reconstruction point, usually taken as the centroid of the cell. The proposed image estimation technique selects the reconstruction point within the quantization partition cell which results in a reconstructed image that best fits a non-Gaussian Markov random field (MRF) image model. This approach results in a convex constrained optimization problem that can be solved iteratively. At each iteration, the gradient projection method is used to update the estimate based on the image model. In the transform domain, the resulting coefficient reconstruction points are projected to the particular quantization partition cells defined by the compressed image. Experimental results will be shown for images compressed using scalar quantization of block DCT and using vector quantization of subband wavelet transform. The proposed image decompression provides a reconstructed image with reduced visibility of transform coding artifacts and superior perceived quality.","doi":"10.1109/76.475891","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/10143/00475891.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.475891","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10143","startPage":"490","endPage":"499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved image decompression for reduced transform coding artifacts","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=475891","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improved image decompression for reduced transform coding artifacts","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/475891/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","accessionNumber":"5174849","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved image decompression for reduced transform coding artifacts","sourcePdf":"00475891.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084927S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"124","articleId":"475891","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":475892,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The trellis symbols are entropy-coded using arithmetic coding. The performance of the arithmetic coded uniform threshold TCQ, for encoding the family of generalized Gaussian densities, is compared with uniform threshold quantization (UTQ) and the Shannon lower bound (SLB). At high rates, the method performs within 0.5 dB of the rate-distortion bound for the family of generalized Gaussian densities. A simple modification of the uniform codebook is shown to result in improved performance at low bit rates. The arithmetic and trellis coding method is used for encoding image subbands. Coding results for monochrome images are presented and compared with other results in the literature.

This TD-UTD impulse response is obtained by a Fourier inversion of the corresponding frequency domain UTD solution. An analytic signal representation of the transient fields is used because it provides a very simple procedure to avoid the difficulties that result when inverting frequency domain UTD fields associated with rays that traverse line or smooth caustics. The TD-UTD response to a more general transient wave excitation of the wedge may be found via convolution. A very useful representation for modeling a general pulsed astigmatic wave excitation is also developed which, in particular, allows its convolution with the TD-UTD impulse response to be done in closed form.

The reconstruction algorithm is, in principle, the same as that used before for reconstructing the conductivity of a penetrable object and uses the fact that for high conductivity the skin depth of the scatterer is small, in which case the only meaningful information produced by the algorithm is the boundary of the scatterer. A striking increase in efficiency is achieved by incorporating into the algorithm the fact that for large conductivity, the contrast is dominated by a large positive imaginary part. This fact together with the knowledge that the scatterer is constrained in some test domain constitute the only a priori information about the scatterer that is used. There are no other implicit assumptions about the location, connectivity, convexity, or boundary conditions.

In a departure from previous techniques wherein spatial parallelism is used, our approach exploits massive temporal parallelism by computing all of the time steps in parallel. Furthermore, in contrast to other methods which appear to concentrate on explicit schemes such as Yee's (1966) algorithm, our strategy uses the implicit Crank-Nicolson technique which provides superior numerical properties. We show that the use of temporal parallelism results in algorithms which offer a massive degree of coarse grain parallelism with minimum communication and synchronization requirements. Due to these features, the time-parallel algorithms are particularly suitable for implementation on emerging massively parallel multiple instruction-multiple data (MIMD) architectures. The methodology is applied to a circular cylindrical configuration, which serves as a testbed problem for the approach, to demonstrate the massive parallelism that can be exploited. We also discuss the generalization of the methodology for more complex problems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A massively parallel computation strategy for FDTD: time and space parallelism applied to electromagnetics problems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.475935","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/10144/00475935.pdf","startPage":"1441","endPage":"1449","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.475935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10144","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=475935","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/475935/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","displayDocTitle":"A massively parallel computation strategy for FDTD: time and space parallelism applied to electromagnetics problems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","accessionNumber":"5158091","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A massively parallel computation strategy for FDTD: time and space parallelism applied to electromagnetics problems","sourcePdf":"00475935.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048864S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"17","articleId":"475935","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":475937,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

Finding an optimal task-allocation is NP-hard in the strong sense. An efficient algorithm is presented for optimal task-allocation in a distributed computing system with level-2 redundancy. The algorithm, (a) uses branch and bound with underestimates for reducing the average time complexity of optimal task-allocation computations, and (b) reorders the list of modules to allow a subset of modules that does not intra-communicate to be assigned last, for further reduction in the computations of optimal task-allocation for maximizing reliability. An efficient heuristics algorithm is given which obtains sub-optimal solutions in a reasonable computation time. The performance of our algorithms is given over a wide range of parameters such as number of modules, number of processing nodes, ratio of average execution cost to average communication cost, and connectivity of modules. The effectiveness of the optimal task-allocation algorithm is demonstrated by comparing it to a competing optimal task-allocation algorithm, for maximizing reliability. The performance of our algorithm improves very much when the difference between the number of modules and the connectivity increases.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","startPage":"575","endPage":"586","doi":"10.1109/24.475976","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/24.475976","pdfPath":"/iel1/24/10146/00475976.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved task-allocation algorithms to maximize reliability of redundant distributed computing systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/475976/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","displayDocTitle":"Improved task-allocation algorithms to maximize reliability of redundant distributed computing systems","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","accessionNumber":"5148441","volume":"44","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved task-allocation algorithms to maximize reliability of redundant distributed computing systems","sourcePdf":"00475976.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033722S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"16","articleId":"475976","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":475985,"authors":[{"name":"R.

One challenge that must be met in order to truly realize this potential is that of providing mobile clients with ubiquitous access to data. One way (and perhaps the only way) to address these challenges is to provide stationary server machines with a relatively high-bandwidth channel over which to broadcast data to a client population in anticipation of the need for that data by the clients. Such a system can be said to be asymmetric due to the disparity in the transmission capacities of clients and servers. We have proposed a mechanism called broadcast disks to provide database access in this environment as well as in other asymmetric systems such as cable and direct broadcast satellite television networks and information distribution services. The broadcast disk approach enables the creation of an arbitrarily fine-grained memory hierarchy on the broadcast medium. This hierarchy, combined with the inversion of the traditional relationship between clients and servers that occurs in a broadcast-based system, raises fundamental new issues for client cache management and data prefetching. In this article we present a brief overview of asymmetric environments and describe our approaches to broadcast disk organization, client cache management, and prefetching.","doi":"10.1109/98.475988","publicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/98/10192/00475988.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"60","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/98.475988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dissemination-based data delivery using broadcast disks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=475988","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/475988/","displayDocTitle":"Dissemination-based data delivery using broadcast disks","volume":"2","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","accessionNumber":"5163430","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dissemination-based data delivery using broadcast disks","sourcePdf":"00475988.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043299S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"98","citationCount":"163","articleId":"475988","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":475993,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Analytic, simulation, and hybrid models are commonly used for obtaining reliability measures. These measures are functions of component failure rates and fault-coverage (probabilities). Coverage provides information about the fault and error detection, isolation, and system recovery capabilities. This parameter can be derived by physical or simulated fault injection. Statistical inference has been used to extract meaningful information from sample observation. The problem of conducting fault injection experiments and statistically inferring the coverage from the information gathered in those experiments is addressed in this paper. We perform statistical experiments in a multi-dimensional space of events. In this way all major factors which influence the coverage (fault locations, timing characteristics of the fault, and the workload) are accounted for. Multi-stage, stratified, and combined multi-stage and stratified sampling are used in this paper for deriving the coverage. Equations of the mean, variance, and confidence interval of the coverage are provided. The statistical error produced by the injected faults which do not induce errors in the tested system (also known as the nonresponse problem) is considered, A program which emulates a typical fault environment was developed and four hypothetical systems are analyzed.","doi":"10.1109/24.475993","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/24.475993","startPage":"632","endPage":"639","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel1/24/10146/00475993.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using multi-stage and stratified sampling for inferring fault-coverage probabilities","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","displayDocTitle":"Using multi-stage and stratified sampling for inferring fault-coverage probabilities","publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"44","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5148448","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/475993/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using multi-stage and stratified sampling for inferring fault-coverage probabilities","sourcePdf":"00475993.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052568S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"12","articleId":"475993","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":476002,"authors":[{"name":"Jianan Xue","affiliation":["Wayne State University, Detroit, USA"],"lastName":"Jianan Xue","id":"37087195683"},{"name":"Kai Yang","affiliation":["Wayne State University, Detroit, USA"],"lastName":"Kai Yang","id":"37087387313"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9529"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1721"}],"articleNumber":"476002","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":104,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":588},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Reliability Society","url":"http://rs.ieee.org/publications.html"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic reliability analysis of coherent multistate systems","abstract":"This paper generalizes 2-state (binary-state) reliability parameters 'R(t), F(t), /spl lambda/(t), and mean-time to-failure' to multi-state reliability parameters 'R(t,i), G(t,i), /spl lambda/(t,i), mean-life-span-at-specified-performance-level(i), for each state'.

In the development of such PCN, Geostationary, Medium, and Low Earth Orbiting (GEO, MEO, LEO) satellite constellations will play a fundamental role to provide worldwide coverage for most services required by the end-user. The characteristics of efficiency and flexibility inherently required by that scenario suggest, amidst other possibilities, to take into special consideration a radio interface based on code division multiple access (CDMA) to ensure, in addition to the features mentioned above, a sufficient grade of power and spectral efficiency of the relevant satellite radio link. The aim of this paper is a review of the current status of those issues in the field of satellite CDMA transmission systems design that, in our opinion, appear fundamental to the successful operation of an efficient PCN. In particular, we survey the techniques for multiplexing, coding and transmission of direct-sequence spread spectrum (DS/SS) signals, and we touch upon the techniques for the minimization of the self-noise effect, and the related topics of power-control and multiuser detection. We also shortly address in this respect some technological aspects related to an efficient modem design via digital signal processing techniques. The final part of the paper deals more specifically with some typical issues of satellite transmission, namely the minimization of the detrimental effects of the nonlinear satellite transponder and of multipath propagation; the applicability of diversity reception to a multisatellite network is also addressed as possible means of performance boost.","doi":"10.1109/5.476023","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/10193/00476023.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"39","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.476023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advances in satellite CDMA transmission for mobile and personal communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476023/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1996","displayDocTitle":"Advances in satellite CDMA transmission for mobile and personal communications","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5175048","volume":"84","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1996","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advances in satellite CDMA transmission for mobile and personal communications","sourcePdf":"00476023.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11406S","chronDate":"Jan.  1996","isNumber":"10193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"49","articleId":"476023","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-11"},{"_id":476035,"authors":[{"name":"T.J.

A generic model of dynamic loads is used to investigate the influence of active and reactive power dynamics on the damping of oscillations in a multimachine power system. The interaction between the load and the power system is explored in terms of load and system transfer functions. It is shown that the power system transfer function is composed of a static part and a dynamic part. The static part is derived from the power flow Jacobian. The investigations indicate that load voltage dynamics can significantly influence the damping of modal oscillations. Static load models can give quite misleading predictions of damping when loads actually exhibit dynamic behaviour.","doi":"10.1109/59.476041","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/10147/00476041.pdf","startPage":"1781","endPage":"1788","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.476041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load modelling in studies of power system damping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=476041","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476041/","displayDocTitle":"Load modelling in studies of power system damping","volume":"10","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","accessionNumber":"5149562","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load modelling in studies of power system damping","sourcePdf":"00476041.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067908S","chronDate":"Nov.  1995","isNumber":"10147","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"85","articleId":"476041","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":476045,"authors":[{"name":"Kit Po Wong","affiliation":["AI and Power Systems Research Group Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Western Australia, Nedlands, WA, Australia"],"lastName":"Kit Po Wong","id":"37087255174"},{"name":"Bei Fan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Bei Fan","id":"37087970283"},{"name":"C.S.

Based on the energy method, a direct mapping relation between power system loading conditions and the VSMs is set up via the ANN. A systematic method for selecting the ANN's input variables was developed using sensitivity analysis. The effects of ANN's training pattern sensitivity problems were also studied by dividing system operating conditions into several loading levels based on sensitivity analysis.

The strengths of this powerful technique lie in its ability to forecast accurately on weekdays, as well as, on weekends, public holidays, and days before and after public holidays. Furthermore, use of fuzzy logic effectively handles the load variations due to special events. The fuzzy-neural network (FNN) has been extensively tested on actual data obtained from a power system for 24-hour ahead prediction based on forecast weather information. Very impressive results, with an average error of 0.62% on weekdays, 0.83% on Saturdays and 1.17% on Sundays and public holidays have been obtained. This approach avoids complex mathematical calculations and training on many years of data, and is simple to implement on a personal computer.","doi":"10.1109/59.476055","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/10147/00476055.pdf","startPage":"1897","endPage":"1903","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.476055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Demand forecasting using fuzzy neural computation, with special emphasis on weekend and public holiday forecasting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=476055","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476055/","displayDocTitle":"Demand forecasting using fuzzy neural computation, with special emphasis on weekend and public holiday forecasting","volume":"10","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","accessionNumber":"5149576","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demand forecasting using fuzzy neural computation, with special emphasis on weekend and public holiday forecasting","sourcePdf":"00476055.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053398S","chronDate":"Nov.  1995","isNumber":"10147","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"97","articleId":"476055","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":476058,"authors":[{"name":"Po-Hung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan Institute of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Po-Hung Chen","id":"38151442500"},{"name":"Hong-Chan Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan Institute of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hong-Chan Chang","id":"37367512200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8950"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0679"}],"articleNumber":"476058","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":375,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2391},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-scale economic dispatch by genetic algorithm","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/10147/00476058.pdf","startPage":"1919","endPage":"1926","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.476058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10147","doi":"10.1109/59.476058","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Large-scale systems","Genetic algorithms","Encoding","Power generation economics","Biological cells","Power system reliability","Robustness","Power system economics","Power system planning","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large-scale systems","power system control","load dispatching","economics","optimal control","genetic algorithms","control system synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","large-scale power systems","economic dispatch","encoding technique","chromosome","incremental cost","network losses","ramp rate limits","prohibited zone avoidance","electric utility","control design"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=476058","abstract":"This paper presents a new genetic approach for solving the economic dispatch problem in large-scale power systems.

The salient feature makes the proposed genetic approach attractive in large and complex systems which other methodologies may fail to achieve. Moreover, the approach can take network losses, ramp rate limits, and prohibited zone avoidance into account because of genetic algorithm's flexibility.

This formulation extends the traditional economic dispatch methods used in study applications such as unit commitment to include area demand constraints, area reserve constraints, and tie line capacity constraints between the modeled areas. The MAED is formulated as a capacitated nonlinear network flow problem which is solved using a high-speed network load flow code. The MAED determines the amount of power that can be economically generated in one area and transferred to another area to displace generation in the second area. The network flow model does not compute the actual power transfer between areas. The paper demonstrates that a significant number of the problem constraints may be formulated as network-type, and as a result, the method provides a robust, high-speed solution method for surprisingly large class of electric utility problems including the ability to analyze potential purchases and sales in a multi-area power system environment.","doi":"10.1109/59.476062","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/10147/00476062.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.476062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10147","startPage":"1946","endPage":"1951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-area economic dispatch with tie line constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=476062","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-area economic dispatch with tie line constraints","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476062/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","accessionNumber":"5149583","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-area economic dispatch with tie line constraints","sourcePdf":"00476062.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039189S","chronDate":"Nov.  1995","isNumber":"10147","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"86","articleId":"476062","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":476065,"authors":[{"name":"P.S.

This is accomplished by using the least absolute value (LAV) state estimation method and applying the previously suggested two stage estimation approach by A. Monticelli (see ibid., vol.8, no.3, p.1143-9, 1993). The ability of the LAV estimators to reject inconsistent measurements, is exploited in order to differentiate between circuit breaker status and analog measurement errors. The first stage of estimation uses a bus level network model as in conventional LAV estimators. Results of stage 1 are used to draw a set of suspect buses whose substation configurations may be erroneous. In the second stage, the identified buses are modeled in detail using the bus sections and the circuit breaker models while keeping the bus level network models for the rest of the system. The LAV estimation is repealed for the expanded system model and any remaining significant normalized residuals are flagged as bad analog measurements, while the correct topology is determined based on the estimated flows through the modeled circuit breakers in the substations. The proposed approach is implemented and tested. Simulation results for cases involving circuit breaker status and/or analog measurement errors are provided.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/10147/00476072.pdf","startPage":"2029","endPage":"2037","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/59.476072","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.476072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10147","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=476072","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identifying the unknown circuit breaker statuses in power networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit breakers","Intelligent networks","State estimation","Power system modeling","Substations","Network topology","Circuit topology","Load flow","Power engineering and energy","Measurement errors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit breakers","linear programming","measurement errors","error analysis","power systems","state estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unknown circuit breaker status identification","power networks","circuit breaker status errors","analog measurement errors","least absolute value state estimation","bus level network model","substation configurations","suspect buses","topology errors","weighted least absolute value","linear programming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476072/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Identifying the unknown circuit breaker statuses in power networks","volume":"10","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","accessionNumber":"5149594","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identifying the unknown circuit breaker statuses in power networks","sourcePdf":"00476072.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055048S","chronDate":"Nov.  1995","isNumber":"10147","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"85","articleId":"476072","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":476075,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofeng Zhang","affiliation":["San Ramon, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaofeng Zhang","id":"38150186500"},{"name":"F.

By exploiting instruction-level parallelism, superscalar processors are capable of executing more than one instruction in a clock cycle. This paper discusses the microarchitecture of superscalar processors. We begin with a discussion of the general problem solved by superscalar processors: converting an ostensibly sequential program into a more parallel one. The principles underlying this process, and the constraints that must be met, are discussed. The paper then provides a description of the specific implementation techniques used in the important phases of superscalar processing. The major phases include: (1) instruction fetching and conditional branch processing, (2) the determination of data dependences involving register values, (3) the initiation, or issuing, of instructions for parallel execution, (4) the communication of data values through memory via loads and stores, and (5) committing the process state in correct order so that precise interrupts can be supported. Examples of recent superscalar microprocessors, the MIPS R10000, the DEC 21164, and the AMD K5 are used to illustrate a variety of superscalar methods.","doi":"10.1109/5.476078","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/10194/00476078.pdf","startPage":"1609","endPage":"1624","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.476078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The microarchitecture of superscalar processors","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1995","displayDocTitle":"The microarchitecture of superscalar processors","volume":"83","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5167960","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476078/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The microarchitecture of superscalar processors","sourcePdf":"00476078.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055056S","chronDate":"Dec.  1995","isNumber":"10194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"152","articleId":"476078","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":476081,"authors":[{"name":"M.

However, considering the computations made by Gilhoussen et. al. for the reverse link, we note the following: the calculations lead at a given moment to the evaluation of the average external interference for which a quantity is claimed only intuitively to be an upper bound. We construct a sequence of approximations for the average external interference, where the average external interference is the sequence limit. The claimed upper bound of Gilhoussen is also the first element of this sequence of approximations.

The equalized DMT is shown to recover a significant portion of the performance loss incurred because of the use of a moderate-size FFT in the DMT to reduce latency and implementation cost. In particular, equalizers designed using our new criterion result in a higher DMT performance margin than traditional mean-square-error DMT equalizers. Finally, additional promising methods that further enhance the performance of the equalized DMT are investigated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/10176/00476097.pdf","startPage":"56","endPage":"64","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.476097","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.476097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10176","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=476097","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum finite-length equalization for multicarrier transceivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","OFDM modulation","Equalizers","Contracts","Bandwidth","Costs","Laboratories","Performance loss","Delay","Data communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","telecommunication channels","intersymbol interference","transceivers","fast Fourier transforms","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicarrier transceivers","ISI channels","cyclic prefix overhead","discrete multitone transceiver","fixed transmission bandwidth","optimum finite-length equalization","equalizers","FFT"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476097/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1996","displayDocTitle":"Optimum finite-length equalization for multicarrier transceivers","volume":"44","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1996","accessionNumber":"5173342","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum finite-length equalization for multicarrier transceivers","sourcePdf":"00476097.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041768S","chronDate":"Jan 1996","isNumber":"10176","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"232","articleId":"476097","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":476098,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The total capacity and the total asymptotic efficiency of the PAM synchronous Gaussian CDMA (PSG-CDMA) channel are considered as the optimality criteria. The latter measure is monotonic with the determinant of the correlation matrix, R, and the former is monotonic with det(I+/spl sigma//sup -2/R), where /spl sigma//sup 2/ represents the noise level. Average as well as maximum RMS bandwidth constraints are considered in the equal-energy case, and the energy-weighted RMS bandwidth constraint is considered for unequal energy signals. For the equal-energy problem, signal sets are found that simultaneously optimize the total asymptotic efficiency under both average and maximum RMS bandwidth constraints. For the total capacity measure, such simultaneously optimal signal sets are also obtained, albeit under the restriction that the number of signals n be a Hadamard matrix dimension. When the Hadamard dimension is in particular a power of two, we obtain optimum signal sets that are shown to yield equal optimum multiuser detector asymptotic efficiencies for all users of an uncoded PSG-CDMA channel.

The near-far problem occurs when the amplitudes of the users received signals are very dissimilar, as the case might be in many important applications. In particular, the standard method for estimating the propagation delays will fail in a near-far situation. Several new estimators, the maximum likelihood, an approximative maximum likelihood and a subspace-based estimator, are therefore proposed and are shown to be robust against the near-far problem. No knowledge of the transmitted bits is assumed, and the proposed estimators can thus be used for both acquisition and tracking.

Bayesian reconstruction methods overcome this instability by introducing prior information, often in the form of a spatial smoothness regularizer. More elaborate forms of smoothness constraints may be used to extend the role of the prior beyond that of a stabilizer in order to capture actual spatial information about the object. Previously proposed forms of such prior distributions were based on the assumption of a piecewise constant source distribution. Here, the authors propose an extension to a piecewise linear model-the weak plate-which is more expressive than the piecewise constant model. The weak plate prior not only preserves edges but also allows for piecewise ramplike regions in the reconstruction. Indeed, for the authors' application in SPECT, such ramplike regions are observed in ground-truth source distributions in the form of primate autoradiographs of rCBF radionuclides. To incorporate the weak plate prior in a MAP approach, the authors model the prior as a Gibbs distribution and use a GEM formulation for the optimization. They compare quantitative performance of the ML-EM algorithm, a GEM algorithm with a prior favoring piecewise constant regions, and a GEM algorithm with their weak plate prior. Pointwise and regional bias and variance of ensemble image reconstructions are used as indications of image quality. The authors' results show that the weak plate and membrane priors exhibit improved bias and variance relative to ML-EM techniques.","doi":"10.1109/42.476108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.476108","endPage":"680","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/10149/00476108.pdf","startPage":"669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian image reconstruction in SPECT using higher order mechanical models as priors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476108/","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian image reconstruction in SPECT using higher order mechanical models as priors","volume":"14","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"5147665","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"18215871","publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian image reconstruction in SPECT using higher order mechanical models as priors","sourcePdf":"00476108.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06824S","chronDate":"Dec.  1995","isNumber":"10149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"63","articleId":"476108","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":476112,"authors":[{"name":"S.-C.B.

Quantitative studies of coronary atherosclerosis using intravascular ultrasound and manual identification of wall and plaque borders are limited by the need for observers with substantial experience and the tedious nature of manual border detection. We have developed a method for segmentation of intravascular ultrasound images that identifies the internal and external elastic laminae and the plaque-lumen interface. The border detection algorithm was evaluated in a set of 38 intravascular ultrasound images acquired from fresh cadaveric hearts using a 30 MHz imaging catheter. To assess the performance of our border detection method we compared five quantitative measures of arterial anatomy derived from computer-detected borders with measures derived from borders manually defined by expert observers. Computer-detected and observer-defined lumen areas correlated very well (r=0.96, y=1.02x+0.52), as did plaque areas (r=0.95, y=1.07x-0.48), and percent area stenosis (r=0.93, y=0.99x-1.34.) Computer-derived segmental plaque thickness measurements were highly accurate. Our knowledge-based intravascular ultrasound segmentation method shows substantial promise for the quantitative analysis of in vivo intravascular ultrasound image data.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/10149/00476113.pdf","startPage":"719","endPage":"732","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/42.476113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.476113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10149","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=476113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segmentation of intravascular ultrasound images: a knowledge-based approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Ultrasonic imaging","Ultrasonic variables measurement","Arteries","Atherosclerosis","Detection algorithms","Heart","Catheters","Anatomy","Thickness measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","medical image processing","image segmentation","angiocardiography","knowledge based systems","medical expert systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intravascular ultrasound images","knowledge-based approach","coronary arteries","coronary lumen","plaque characteristics","coronary wall","coronary atherosclerosis","manual identification","plaque borders","external elastic laminae","plaque-lumen interface","internal elastic laminae","border detection algorithm","fresh cadaveric hearts","arterial anatomy","computer-detected borders","expert observers","observer-defined lumen areas","plaque areas","percent area stenosis","quantitative analysis","30 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476113/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Segmentation of intravascular ultrasound images: a knowledge-based approach","volume":"14","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","accessionNumber":"5147670","pubMedId":"18215876","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmentation of intravascular ultrasound images: a knowledge-based approach","sourcePdf":"00476113.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063014S","chronDate":"Dec.  1995","isNumber":"10149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"159","articleId":"476113","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":476131,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The performance of IM-DD and coherent asynchronous ASK systems have been evaluated in terms of the Q factor. We have considered the propagation in links encompassing conventional step-index fibers, DS fibers and in links with two different dispersion management techniques in which the chromatic dispersion is varied along the propagation distance both in randomly and in deterministically way.

This paper presents a study of the crosstalk performance of these amplifiers. A theoretical analysis is presented from which a numerical model is developed and is used to predict the crosstalk performance of a typical amplifier. Experimental results, using two separate signals within the gain band, show good agreement between measurement and theory, indicating that it is unlikely that crosstalk will present a problem in anticipated amplifier applications. From the measured crosstalk, an upper limit is placed on the lower level lifetime, indicating that the population of this level will have a negligible effect amplifier gain. A novel technique for measuring the upper state lifetime in an amplifier, based on pump power dependence of crosstalk, is described and experimental results which are in agreement with fluorescent decay are presented.","doi":"10.1109/50.476138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.476138","startPage":"66","endPage":"71","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/10179/00476138.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crosstalk in 1.3 /spl mu/m praseodymium fluoride fiber amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1996","displayDocTitle":"Crosstalk in 1.3 /spl mu/m praseodymium fluoride fiber amplifiers","publicationDate":"Jan. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"14","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5179325","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476138/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crosstalk in 1.3 /spl mu/m praseodymium fluoride fiber amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00476138.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024659S","chronDate":"Jan 1996","isNumber":"10179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"4","articleId":"476138","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":476139,"authors":[{"name":"G.F.

Harmonic distortion measurements were made with two single-frequency offset-phased-locked Nd:YAG lasers which provide a source dynamic range greater than 130 dB and a 1 MHz-50 GHz frequency range. Carrier transport is analytically described by three coupled nonlinear differential equations, Poisson's equation and the hole and electron continuity equations. These equations are numerically solved to investigate and isolate the various nonlinear mechanisms. The numerical solution incorporates diffusion since our treatment includes carrier generation in the highly doped p-region of the device. This p-region absorption and carrier-dependent carrier velocities associated with a perturbed electric field (due to space-charge and loading effects) are shown to dominate photodetector nonlinear behavior. The numerical model was extended to predict that maximum photodetector currents of 100 mA should be possible in 20 GHz bandwidth devices before a sharp increase in nonlinear output occurs. In addition, second harmonic distortion improvements of 40-60 dB may be possible if photodetectors can be fabricated with strictly-depleted absorbing regions.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/10179/00476141.pdf","startPage":"84","endPage":"96","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/50.476141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.476141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10179","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=476141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinearities in p-i-n microwave photodetectors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["PIN photodiodes","Photodetectors","Poisson equations","Distortion measurement","Numerical models","Harmonic distortion","Differential equations","Nonlinear equations","Frequency measurement","Laser modes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["p-i-n photodiodes","photodetectors","microwave detectors","harmonic distortion","nonlinear differential equations","carrier mobility"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["p-i-n microwave photodetectors","nonlinearities","p-i-n photodetectors","harmonic distortion measurements","single-frequency offset-phased-locked Nd:YAG lasers","source dynamic range","frequency range","carrier transport","coupled nonlinear differential equations","Poisson's equation","electron continuity equations","hole continuity equation","nonlinear mechanisms","numerical solution","carrier generation","highly doped p-region","p-region absorption","carrier-dependent carrier velocities","perturbed electric field","space-charge","loading effects","photodetector nonlinear behavior","1 MHz to 50 GHz","100 mA","20 GHz","YAG:Nd","YAl5O12:Nd"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476141/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1996","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinearities in p-i-n microwave photodetectors","volume":"14","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1996","accessionNumber":"5179328","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinearities in p-i-n microwave photodetectors","sourcePdf":"00476141.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049954S","chronDate":"Jan 1996","isNumber":"10179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"179","articleId":"476141","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":476143,"authors":[{"name":"Jianluo Zhang","affiliation":["JDS-FITEL, Inc., Nepean, ONT, Canada","Department of Physics, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Jianluo Zhang","id":"37351713000"},{"name":"Chao-Yu Yue","affiliation":["MPB Technologies, Inc., Dorval, Canada"],"lastName":"Chao-Yu Yue","id":"38155652200"},{"name":"G.W.

The laser can provide up to 20 mW output power over much of its 1525 to 1570 nm wavelength tuning range. The short-term linewidth of the laser output measured is less than 5 kHz. The laser frequency is actively stabilized for a long time by exploiting the inherent filter nature of the compound-ring resonator. The reduction of an associated frequency modulation is also discussed in detail.","doi":"10.1109/50.476143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.476143","endPage":"109","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/10179/00476143.pdf","startPage":"104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stable single-mode compound-ring erbium-doped fiber laser","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476143/","displayDocTitle":"Stable single-mode compound-ring erbium-doped fiber laser","volume":"14","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"5179330","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1996","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stable single-mode compound-ring erbium-doped fiber laser","sourcePdf":"00476143.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066527S","chronDate":"Jan 1996","isNumber":"10179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"93","articleId":"476143","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":476165,"authors":[{"name":"T.M.

This paper presents the first rigorous and quantitative theoretical analysis of the conversion error introduced by an important type of D/A converter with dynamic element matching, In addition to supporting previously published experimental results that indicate the conversion error consists of white noise instead of harmonic distortion, the analysis provides an expression for the power of the white noise in terms of the power of the input sequence and the component matching errors. A yield estimation technique based on the expression is presented that can be used to estimate how the power of the white noise varies across different copies of the same D/A converter circuit for any given component matching error statistics.","doi":"10.1109/82.476174","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/10161/00476174.pdf","startPage":"763","endPage":"772","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.476174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A rigorous error analysis of D/A conversion with dynamic element matching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=476174","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476174/","displayDocTitle":"A rigorous error analysis of D/A conversion with dynamic element matching","volume":"42","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","accessionNumber":"5167911","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A rigorous error analysis of D/A conversion with dynamic element matching","sourcePdf":"00476174.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03591S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"40","articleId":"476174","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":476175,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Instead, the system achieves the effect of oversampling from the multiplicity of modulators. For a system containing M P/sup th/-order /spl Delta//spl Sigma/ modulators, approximately P bits of accuracy are gained for every doubling of M. A major benefit of the architecture is that it retains much of the robustness of the individual /spl Delta//spl Sigma/ modulators to nonideal circuit behavior.

The trend towards monolithic Integration poses some major challenges. This paper discusses the phase noise aspects of LC-tuned oscillators. A general formula is developed, based on the concepts of effective resistance and capacitance. The formula also applies for oscillators using active inductors. From these results the importance of an inductor with very low series resistance is apparent.

We propose a new taxonomy that shows the relative position of each and every heterogeneous system in the overall computer systems world. The proposed taxonomy is intended to be both broad enough to encompass all existing heterogeneous systems and simple enough to be easily accepted. Consequently, our taxonomy includes only four classes of computer systems. We propose that computer systems be classified as follows: SESM (single execution mode, single machine model); SEMM (single execution mode, multiple machine models), MESM (multiple execution modes, single machine model), and MEMM (multiple execution modes, multiple machine models).","doi":"10.1109/2.476202","startPage":"68","publicationTitle":"Computer","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel1/2/10196/00476202.pdf","endPage":"70","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10196","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2.476202","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476202/","displayDocTitle":"EM/sup 3/: a taxonomy of heterogeneous computing systems","volume":"28","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5156993","publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EM/sup 3/: a taxonomy of heterogeneous computing systems","sourcePdf":"00476202.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059725S","chronDate":"Dec.  1995","isNumber":"10196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"7","articleId":"476202","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":476211,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Both AG codes and multidimensional cyclic codes are described by a unified theory of linear block codes defined over point sets: AG codes are defined over the points of an algebraic curve, and an m-dimensional cyclic code is defined over the points in m-dimensional space. The power of the unified theory is in its description of decoding techniques using Grobner bases. In order to fit an AG code into this theory, a change of coordinates must be applied to the curve over which the code is defined so that the curve is in special position. For curves in special position, all computations can be performed with polynomials and this also makes it possible to use the theory of Grobner bases. Next, a transform is defined for AG codes which generalizes the discrete Fourier transform. The transform is also related to a Grobner basis, and is useful in setting up the decoding problem. In the decoding problem, a key step is finding a Grobner basis for an error locator ideal. For AG codes, multidimensional cyclic codes, and indeed, any cross section of an extended multidimensional cyclic code, Sakata's algorithm can be used to find linear recursion relations which hold on the syndrome array. In this general context, the authors give a self-contained and simplified presentation of Sakata's algorithm, and present a general framework for decoding algorithms for this family of codes, in which the use of Sakata's algorithm is supplemented by a procedure for extending the syndrome array.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multidimensional systems","Decoding","Fourier transforms","Polynomials","Discrete Fourier transforms","Block codes","Discrete transforms","Error correction codes","Reed-Solomon codes","Mathematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","cyclic codes","block codes","algebraic geometric codes","linear codes","discrete Fourier transforms","error correction codes","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebraic-geometric codes","multidimensional cyclic codes","unified theory","decoding","Grobner bases","algorithms","linear block codes","point set","algebraic curve","m-dimensional space","polynomial","discrete Fourier transform","error locator","Sakata's algorithm","linear recursion relations","syndrome array"]}],"doi":"10.1109/18.476246","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/10152/00476246.pdf","startPage":"1733","endPage":"1751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.476246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algebraic-geometric codes and multidimensional cyclic codes: a unified theory and algorithms for decoding using Grobner bases","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=476246","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Algebraic-geometric codes and multidimensional cyclic codes: a unified theory and algorithms for decoding using Grobner bases","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476246/","volume":"41","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5179676","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algebraic-geometric codes and multidimensional cyclic codes: a unified theory and algorithms for decoding using Grobner bases","sourcePdf":"00476246.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033416S","chronDate":"Nov 1995","isNumber":"10152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"46","articleId":"476246","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":476247,"authors":[{"name":"C.

All the filters are characterized using available information at the base station only. Performance results presented include bit error rates, signal powers and spectral densities for data rates between 10 to 100 Mbits/s and sensitivity to automatic gain control errors.

Issues in providing multimedia services on wireless include multiple access, bandwidth rationing and power control. We address the latter two issues. CDMA is assumed to be the access method. Different services have different quality (QoS) requirements, maximum power and/or minimum rate constraints. In order to achieve the required QoS they can alter their power and/or rate of transmission. Different rates are represented by varying the processing gain. Since users interfere with each other, achieving each user's QoS requirement is completely coupled with the powers. We formulate this as a constrained optimization problem. The objective functions used are minimum power and maximum rates. The former reduces interference seen by other cells due to the current cell, the latter attempts to achieve the best possible throughput for users in the current cell. We develop bounds on the total number of users of each class that can be supported simultaneously while maintaining adequate QoS and meeting resource constraints.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power control and resource management for a multimedia CDMA wireless system","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 6th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1995.476272","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 6th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3461/10132/00476272.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"25 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1995.476272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10132","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=476272","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476272/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Power control and resource management for a multimedia CDMA wireless system","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5346869","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power control and resource management for a multimedia CDMA wireless system","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00476272.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034587S","chronDate":"27-29 Sep 1995","isNumber":"10132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3461","citationCount":"286","articleId":"476272","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":476273,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The structure of the resulting trellis is determined solely by the spans of the atomic codewords. A correspondence between minimal linear block code trellises and configurations of nonattacking rooks on a triangular chess board is established and used to show that the number of distinct minimal linear block code trellises is a Stirling number of the second kind.

We present a new lower bound on the state complexity of linear codes, which includes most of the existing bounds as special cases. The new bound is obtained by dividing the time axis for the code into several sections of varying lengths, as opposed to the division into two sections-the past and the future-employed in the well-known DLP bounds. For a large number of codes this results in a considerable improvement upon the DLP bound. Moreover, we generalize the new bound to nonlinear codes, and introduce several alternative techniques for lower-bounding the trellis complexity, based on the distance spectrum and other combinatorial properties of the code. We also show how the general ideas developed in this paper may be employed to lower-bound the maximum and the total number of branches in the trellis, leading to considerably tighter bounds on these quantities. Furthermore, the asymptotic behavior of the new bounds is investigated, and shown to improve upon the previously known asymptotic estimates of trellis state-complexity.","doi":"10.1109/18.476318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.476318","startPage":"1938","endPage":"1954","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/10153/00476318.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10153","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lower bounds on trellis complexity of block codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476318/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Lower bounds on trellis complexity of block codes","volume":"41","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5191840","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lower bounds on trellis complexity of block codes","sourcePdf":"00476318.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098794S","chronDate":"Nov.  1995","isNumber":"10153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"44","articleId":"476318","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":476319,"authors":[{"name":"K.A.S.

In the present paper, constructions and techniques of the earlier paper are developed and modified for q-ary linear nonbinary covering codes, q/spl ges/3, and new constructions are proposed. The described constructions design an infinite family of codes with covering radius R based on a starting code of the same covering radius. For arbitrary R/spl ges/2, q/spl ges/3, new infinite families of nonbinary covering codes with \"good\" parameters are obtained with the help of an iterative process when constructed codes are the starting codes for the following steps. The table of upper bounds on the length function for codes with q=3, R=2, 3, and codimension up to 24 is given. The author proposes to use saturated sets of points in projective geometries over finite fields as parity check matrices of starting codes.

Centralized and distributed transmitter power control schemes used to minimize the outage probability due to cochannel interference in cellular radio systems have been investigated in previous papers. In these papers, however, the effect of adjacent channel interference (near-far problem) is neglected. The goal of our paper is, based on the previous papers models and ideas, to investigate transmitter power control strategies appropriate for DS/CDMA high capacity cellular radio systems. Monte-Carlo simulation results of these power control schemes indicate that substantial system capacity gains can be obtained with respect to conventional systems. It is also shown that the performance of properly designed distributed algorithms can closely approximate that of the optimum centralized power control scheme.","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00476401.png","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 6th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3461/10132/00476401.pdf","startPage":"46","endPage":"50 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 6th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1995.476401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1995.476401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10132","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=476401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmitter power control for DS/CDMA cellular mobile radio networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio transmitters","Power control","Multiaccess communication","Land mobile radio","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Interchannel interference","Channel allocation","Channel capacity","Mobile communication","Power system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","radio transmitters","power control","telecommunication control","cellular radio","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference","adjacent channel interference","cochannel interference","distributed algorithms","distributed control","centralised control","code division multiple access","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DS/CDMA cellular mobile radio networks","channel allocation","channel capacity","communications quality","cellular radio systems","direct sequence/code-division multiple-access","near-far problem","distributed transmitter power control","centralized transmitter power control","outage probability","cochannel interference","adjacent channel interference","Monte-Carlo simulation results","system capacity gains","distributed algorithms","optimum centralized power control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476401/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Transmitter power control for DS/CDMA cellular mobile radio networks","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5346874","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmitter power control for DS/CDMA cellular mobile radio networks","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00476401.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051276S","chronDate":"27-29 Sep 1995","isNumber":"10132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3461","citationCount":"2","articleId":"476401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":476405,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The basic system operates using the orthogonal multicarrier technique combined with direct sequence code division multiple access. The non-stationary behaviour of the channel is tracked by a periodic sounding. This technique leads to relatively simple receivers that can be implemented with current VLSI and DSP technology. Taking into account the challenges related to an up-link implementation, the system performance in the down-link is investigated both for synchronous and asynchronous DS-CDMAs. In particular, the schemes which work with Walsh sequences (in the synchronous case) are compared with the schemes operating by binary Gold sequences and 4-phase near-optimal sequences (in the asynchronous case). The comparison is carried out on the basis of significant parameters such as bit error rate, spectral efficiency and multipath counteraction for different system configurations.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1995.476405","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 6th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 6th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3461/10132/00476405.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1995.476405","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10132","startPage":"66","endPage":"70 vol.1","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00476405.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance comparison of orthogonal multicarrier DS-CDMA systems in frequency selective slow-fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=476405","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance comparison of orthogonal multicarrier DS-CDMA systems in frequency selective slow-fading channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sep 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476405/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5346878","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance comparison of orthogonal multicarrier DS-CDMA systems in frequency selective slow-fading channels","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00476405.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042377S","chronDate":"27-29 Sep 1995","isNumber":"10132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3461","citationCount":"7","articleId":"476405","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":476406,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Instead of transmitting data sub-streams uniformly through sub-channels, data sub-streams hop over sub-channels with the hopping patterns adaptively adjusted to the channel fading characteristics. The problem of determining the optimal hopping pattern is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, for which an efficient algorithm is designed to solve the problem practically. Simulation results show that the performance in terms of the average system bit error probability (BER) is better than that of a single carrier RAKE system, conventional MC CDMA systems applying moderate error protection and diversity systems with different combining techniques.","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00476407.png","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 6th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3461/10132/00476407.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"80 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 6th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1995.476407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1995.476407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10132","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=476407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-carrier DS-CDMA with adaptive sub-carrier hopping for fading channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Fading","Diversity reception","Frequency","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Design optimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Error probability","Bit error rate","Protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","code division multiple access","adaptive systems","multipath channels","cellular radio","optimisation","error statistics","frequency hop communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-carrier DS-CDMA","adaptive sub-carrier hopping","fading channels","frequency selectivity","reverse link transmission","cellular network","data sub-streams","sub-channels","channel fading","optimal hopping pattern","multi-objective optimization problem","algorithm","bit error probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Multi-carrier DS-CDMA with adaptive sub-carrier hopping for fading channels","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5346880","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-carrier DS-CDMA with adaptive sub-carrier hopping for fading channels","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00476407.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042906S","chronDate":"27-29 Sep 1995","isNumber":"10132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3461","citationCount":"5","articleId":"476407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":476413,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Clutter returns are Doppler shifted due to platform motion forcing the use of processors that can resolve targets in both velocity (Doppler) and azimuth. Fully adaptive processors that operate in both dimensions require prohibitively large computation so that reduced adaptive dimension, or partially adaptive processors must be considered. In conventional partially adaptive linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer design the approach taken has been to represent the interference subspace with some reduced set of vectors, typically the eigenvectors associated with the largest eigenvalues of the interference covariance matrix. This technique does yield good performance but will not give the optimum performance for a given partially adaptive dimension. In this paper, an off-line method for selecting the \"best\" degrees of freedom to be retained in a partially adaptive design is presented. The sequential algorithm described selects those degrees of freedom that best minimize the beamformer output mean square error. This approach leads to a sparse structure for the transformation matrix, which when implemented in a generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) structure results in a reduction in the computational load. This approach also allows a reduction in the required adaptive dimension as compared to the eigenvector based approach. Illustrative examples demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.476428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10154","startPage":"2843","endPage":"2851","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/10154/00476428.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse LCMV beamformer design for suppression of ground clutter in airborne radar","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476428/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Sparse LCMV beamformer design for suppression of ground clutter in airborne radar","publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","accessionNumber":"5174864","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"43","issue":"12","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse LCMV beamformer design for suppression of ground clutter in airborne radar","sourcePdf":"00476428.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034188S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"13","articleId":"476428","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":476429,"authors":[{"name":"S.

First, we present methods for estimating the parameters (characteristic exponent /spl alpha/ and dispersion /spl gamma/) of a S/spl alpha/S distribution from a time series. The fractional lower order moments, with both positive and negative orders, and their applications to signal processing are introduced. Then we present a new algorithm for blind channel identification using the output fractional lower order moments, and the /spl alpha/-Spectrum, a new spectral representation for impulsive signals, is introduced. From the /spl alpha/-Spectrum, we establish the blind identifiability conditions of any FIR channel (mixed-phase, unknown order) with i.i.d. S/spl alpha/S (/spl alpha/>1) input. As a byproduct, a simple algorithm for recovering the phase of any type of a signal from the magnitude of its z-transform is presented. The novelty of our paper is in parameter estimation and blind identification of the FIR channel based on fractional lower order moments of its output data. Monte Carlo simulations clearly demonstrate the performance of the new methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/10154/00476432.pdf","startPage":"2884","endPage":"2897","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.476432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.476432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10154","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=476432","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameter estimation and blind channel identification in impulsive signal environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parameter estimation","Signal processing","Signal processing algorithms","Finite impulse response filter","Random variables","Higher order statistics","Robustness","Limiting","Image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter estimation","identification","time series","signal processing","spectral analysis","iterative methods","transient response","Z transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind channel identification","parameter estimation","impulsive signal environments","symmetric /spl alpha/-stable processes","characteristic exponent","dispersion","time series","fractional lower order moments","signal processing","output fractional lower order moments","/spl alpha/-Spectrum","spectral representation","FIR channel","z-transform","Monte Carlo simulations","iterative method","IID process"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476432/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","displayDocTitle":"Parameter estimation and blind channel identification in impulsive signal environments","volume":"43","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","accessionNumber":"5174868","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter estimation and blind channel identification in impulsive signal environments","sourcePdf":"00476432.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07184S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"129","articleId":"476432","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":476435,"authors":[{"name":"A.L.

The algorithm yields estimates of the IIR channel coefficients, channel noise variance, transition probabilities, and state of the Markov chain. Unlike the optimal maximum likelihood estimator which is computationally infeasible since the computing cost increases exponentially with data length, our algorithm is computationally inexpensive. Our algorithm is based on combining a recursive hidden Markov model (HMM) estimator with a relaxed SPR (strictly positive real) extended least squares (ELS) scheme. In simulation studies we show that the algorithm yields satisfactory estimates even in low SNR. We also compare the performance of our scheme with a truncated FIR scheme and the constant modulus algorithm (CMA) which is currently a popular algorithm in blind equalization.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/10154/00476443.pdf","startPage":"2994","endPage":"3006","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.476443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.476443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10154","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=476443","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind equalization of IIR channels using hidden Markov models and extended least squares","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind equalizers","Hidden Markov models","Least squares methods","State estimation","IIR filters","Finite impulse response filter","Maximum likelihood estimation","Viterbi algorithm","Probability density function","Recursive estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","probability","telecommunication channels","least squares approximations","computational complexity","recursive estimation","equalisers","IIR filters","parameter estimation","state estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind equalization algorithm","IIR channels","noisy channels","hidden Markov models","extended least squares","finite state Markov chain","channel noise variance","transition probabilities","recursive estimator","strictly positive real scheme","SNR","truncated FIR scheme","constant modulus algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476443/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","displayDocTitle":"Blind equalization of IIR channels using hidden Markov models and extended least squares","volume":"43","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","accessionNumber":"5174879","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind equalization of IIR channels using hidden Markov models and extended least squares","sourcePdf":"00476443.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043832S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"19","articleId":"476443","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":476444,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The linear subsystems are allowed to be of nonminimum phase (NMP), though the first LTI can be completely identified only if it is of minimum phase. With a circularly symmetric Gaussian input, the linear subsystems can be identified using simple cepstral operations on a single 2-D slice of the N+1 th-order polyspectrum of the output signal. The linear subsystem of an LTI-ZMNL model can be identified using only a 1-D moment or polyspectral slice if it is of minimum phase. The ZMNL coefficients are not identified and need not be known. The order N of the nonlinearity can, in principle, be estimated from the output signal. The methods are analytically simple, computationally efficient, and possess noise suppression characteristics. Computer simulations are presented to support the theory.","doi":"10.1109/78.476444","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/10154/00476444.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.476444","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"3007","endPage":"3013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind identification of LTI-ZMNL-LTI nonlinear channel models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=476444","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","displayDocTitle":"Blind identification of LTI-ZMNL-LTI nonlinear channel models","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476444/","volume":"43","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","accessionNumber":"5174880","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind identification of LTI-ZMNL-LTI nonlinear channel models","sourcePdf":"00476444.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042369S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"42","articleId":"476444","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":476445,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In this paper, we provide a precise characterization of ESR when queries that may view inconsistent data run concurrently with consistent update transactions. Our first goal is to understand the behavior of queries in the presence of conflicts and to show how ESR in fact is a generalization of SR. So, using the ACTA framework, we formally express the intertransaction conflicts that are recognized by ESR and through that define ESR, analogous to the manner in which conflict-based serializability is defined. Secondly, expressions are derived for the amount of inconsistency (in a data item) viewed by a query and its effects on the results of a query. These inconsistencies arise from concurrent updates allowed by ESR. Thirdly, in order to maintain the inconsistencies within bounds associated with each query, the expressions are used to determine the preconditions that operations have to satisfy. The results of a query, and the errors in it, depend on what a query does with the (possibly inconsistent) data viewed by it. One of the important byproducts of this work is the identification of different types of queries which lend themselves to an analysis of the effects of data inconsistency on the results of the query.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476504/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","volume":"7","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","accessionNumber":"5159755","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"A formal characterization of epsilon serializability","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A formal characterization of epsilon serializability","sourcePdf":"00476504.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059049S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"57","articleId":"476504","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":476509,"authors":[{"name":"X.

Extending the feature vector using orthogonal sets of measurements can reduce the variance of a matching measure, to improve discrimination capability. This paper investigates how different features can be used for discrimination, alone or when integrated into an extended feature vector. This study concentrates on improving feature definition and extraction from a frontal view image, incorporating and extending established measurements. These form an extended feature vector based on four feature sets: geometric (distance) measurements, the eye region, the outline contour, and the profile. The profile, contour, and eye region are described by the Walsh power spectrum, normalized Fourier descriptors, and normalized moments, respectively. Although there is some correlation between the geometrical measures and the other sets, their bases (distance, shape description, sequency, and statistics) are orthogonal and hence appropriate for this research. A database of face images was analyzed using two matching measures which were developed to control differently the contributions of elements of the feature sets. The match was evaluated for both measures for the separate feature sets and for the extended feature vector. Results demonstrated that no feature set alone was sufficient for recognition whereas the extended feature vector could discriminate between subjects successfully.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476509/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5148600","volume":"17","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Extending the feature vector for automatic face recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extending the feature vector for automatic face recognition","sourcePdf":"00476509.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045138S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10157","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"52","articleId":"476509","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":476510,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Segmenting an optic flow field into coherent motion groups and estimating each underlying motion is a very challenging task when the optic flow field is projected from a scene of several independently moving objects. The problem is further complicated if the optic flow data are noisy and partially incorrect. In this paper, the authors present a novel framework for determining such optic flow fields by combining the conventional robust estimation with a modified genetic algorithm. The baseline model used in the development is a linear optic flow motion algorithm due to its computational simplicity. The statistical properties of the generalized linear regression (GLR) model are thoroughly explored and the sensitivity of the motion estimates toward data noise is quantitatively established. Conventional robust estimators are then incorporated into the linear regression model to suppress a small percentage of gross data errors or outliers. However, segmenting an optic flow field consisting of a large portion of incorrect data or multiple motion groups requires a very high robustness that is unattainable by the conventional robust estimators. To solve this problem, the authors propose a genetic partitioning algorithm that elegantly combines the robust estimation with the genetic algorithm by a bridging genetic operator called self-adaptation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optic flow field segmentation and motion estimation using a robust genetic partitioning algorithm","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.476510","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/10157/00476510.pdf","startPage":"1177","endPage":"1190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.476510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10157","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=476510","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476510/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","displayDocTitle":"Optic flow field segmentation and motion estimation using a robust genetic partitioning algorithm","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","accessionNumber":"5148601","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optic flow field segmentation and motion estimation using a robust genetic partitioning algorithm","sourcePdf":"00476510.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046929S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10157","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"43","articleId":"476510","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":476512,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This sudden reduction in performance of the correlation based time delay estimators at low SNR arises from the misidentification of one unique \"extremum\" in very noisy conditions and from the peak fitting procedure in the case of the subsample time delay estimation. In this paper, two new estimators-the MSX and MXS-for the estimation of subsample time delays in narrow-band signals are proposed. In these estimators, cross-correlations and autocorrelations are matched at a number of different lags to yield a number of time delay estimates which are subsequently combined to obtain one robust time delay estimate. They seem to perform adequately over the SNR range used in simulations of -5 to 20 dB. Their performances are compared to those of two cross-correlation based estimators. Using simulated data, it is demonstrated that all four estimators perform well at high SNR, but at low SNR the proposed MSX and MXS estimators offer significant improvements in the bias and variance of the estimates. Additionally, these findings are verified using ultrasonic experimental data at three different SNR.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the subsample time delay estimation of narrowband ultrasonic echoes","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/58.476542","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/10158/00476542.pdf","startPage":"993","endPage":"1001","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.476542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10158","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=476542","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476542/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1995","displayDocTitle":"On the subsample time delay estimation of narrowband ultrasonic echoes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","accessionNumber":"5159235","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the subsample time delay estimation of narrowband ultrasonic echoes","sourcePdf":"476542.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054834S","chronDate":"Nov.  1995","isNumber":"10158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"42","articleId":"476542","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":476557,"authors":[{"name":"H.H.

Since the magnitude of the noise problem is a function of the relative proximity of noisy and sensitive devices, design aids are required which can incorporate the switching noise effects at the post-layout phase of design verification. In our approach, SPICE-compatible lumped element RC substrate macromodels are efficiently generated from the circuit layout using a geometric construct called the Voronoi tessellation. The new models retain the accuracy of previously reported models, but contain orders of magnitude fewer circuit nodes, and are suitable for analyzing larger circuits. The node count reduction is realized by deriving a model topology which automatically adapts itself to the local densities of substrate features associated with the noise coupling. Our strategy has been verified using detailed 2-D device simulation, and successfully applied to some mixed-A/D circuit examples.","doi":"10.1109/43.476576","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.476576","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/10159/00476576.pdf","startPage":"1459","endPage":"1469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated circuit substrate coupling models based on Voronoi tessellation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476576/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","displayDocTitle":"Integrated circuit substrate coupling models based on Voronoi tessellation","volume":"14","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","accessionNumber":"5163686","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated circuit substrate coupling models based on Voronoi tessellation","sourcePdf":"00476576.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045611S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"50","articleId":"476576","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":476578,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The objective is to minimize the total gate area subject to constraints on signal arrival time at the primary outputs. Our approach consists of two steps. In the first step, we compute delay functions (which capture gate area-arrival time tradeoffs) at all nodes in the network, and in the second step we generate the mapping solution based on the computed delay functions and the required times at the primary outputs. For a NAND-decomposed tree, subject to load calculation errors, this two-step approach finds the minimum area mapping satisfying a delay constraint if such solution exists. The algorithm has polynomial run time on a node-balanced tree and is easily extended to mapping a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We also show how to account for the wire delays during the delay function computation step.

Thus, they reduce the number of tests and allow tests generated earlier in the test generation process to be dropped.

As one means of mitigating this effect we present an aggressive hardware-based mechanism that provides effective support for reducing the latency of load instructions. Through the judicious use of instruction predecode, base register caching, and fast address calculation, it becomes possible to complete load instructions up to two cycles earlier than traditional pipeline designs. For a pipeline with one cycle data cache access, this results in what we term a zero-cycle load. A zero-cycle load produces a result prior to reaching the execute stage of the pipeline, allowing subsequent dependent instructions to issue unfettered by load dependencies. Programs executing on processors with support for zero-cycle loads experience significantly fewer pipeline stalls due to load instructions and increased overall performance. We present two pipeline designs supporting zero-cycle loads: one for pipelines with a single stage of instruction decode, and another for pipelines with multiple decode stages. We evaluate these designs in a number of contexts: with and without software support, in-order vs. out-of-order issue, and on architectures with many and few registers. We find that our approach is quite effective at reducing the impact of load latency, even more so on architectures with in-order issue and few registers.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.1995.476815","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 28th Annual International Symposium on Microarchitecture","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 28th Annual International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel2/3464/10210/00476815.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.1995.476815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10210","startPage":"82","endPage":"92","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zero-cycle loads: microarchitecture support for reducing load latency","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=476815","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Zero-cycle loads: microarchitecture support for reducing load latency","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 1995-Dec. 1 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476815/","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 1995","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"November-December 1995","accessionNumber":"5170488","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero-cycle loads: microarchitecture support for reducing load latency","confLoc":"Ann Arbor, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00476815.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080293S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 1995-Dec. 1 1995","isNumber":"10210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3464","citationCount":"57","articleId":"476815","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":476816,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In dynamically scheduled superscalar processors using mechanisms like the reorder buffer, the live ranges for these short-lived variables may occur entirely within the reorder buffer. Therefore, there should be no need to retire (commit) the values produced by these live ranges to the register file. On the basis of this observation, we have proposed a scheme that includes a compiler analysis and a simple architecture extension to avoid the useless commits of the values generated for these short-lived variables.

A solution is to partition the RF into smaller RFs while keeping the total number of registers and ports equal. This paper applies RF partitioning to transport triggered architectures (TTAs); these architectures are of the VLIW type. One may expect that partitioning increases the number of executed cycles because it constrains the number of ports per RF. It is shown that these performance losses are small; e.g. partitioning an RF with 24 registers and four read and four write ports into four RFs with 6 registers and one read and one write port gives a performance loss of only 5.8%. Partitioned RFs consume less area than monolithic RFs with the same number of ports and registers. Experiments show that, if the area saved by partitioning is spent on extra registers, partitioning does, on average, not reduce the performance; it may even result in a small performance gain.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.1995.476840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.1995.476840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10210","startPage":"303","endPage":"312","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 28th Annual International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel2/3464/10210/00476840.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 28th Annual International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=476840","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Registers","Performance loss","VLIW","Vector processors","Parallel architectures","Performance gain","Delay","Energy consumption","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel architectures","instruction sets","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partitioned register file","high performance instruction level parallel architectures","transport triggered architectures","VLIW architecture","performance losses","performance gain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Partitioned register file for TTAs","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 1995-Dec. 1 1995","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 1995","publicationDate":"November-December 1995","accessionNumber":"5170513","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476840/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partitioned register file for TTAs","confLoc":"Ann Arbor, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00476840.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030441S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 1995-Dec. 1 1995","isNumber":"10210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3464","citationCount":"27","articleId":"476840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":476842,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

The achieved throughput module scheduled loop depends on the resource requirements, the dependence pattern, and the register requirements of the computation in the loop body. Traditionally, unrolling followed by acyclic scheduling of the unrolled body has been an alternative to module scheduling. However, there are benefits to unrolling even if the loop is to be module scheduled. Unrolling can improve the throughput by allowing a smaller non-integral effective initiation interval to be achieved. After unrolling, optimizations can be applied to the loop that reduce both the resource requirements and the height of the critical paths. Together, unrolling and unrolling-based optimizations can enable the completion of multiple iterations per cycle in some cases. This paper describes the benefits of unrolling and a set of optimizations for unrolled loops which have been implemented in the IMPACT compiler. The performance benefits of unrolling for five of the SPEC CFP92 programs are reported.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 28th Annual International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel2/3464/10210/00476842.pdf","startPage":"327","endPage":"337","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 28th Annual International Symposium on Microarchitecture","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.1995.476842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.1995.476842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10210","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=476842","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unrolling-based optimizations for modulo scheduling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Processor scheduling","Registers","Pipeline processing","Throughput","Scheduling algorithm","Delay","Computer aided instruction","Parallel processing","Hardware","Optimizing compilers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipeline processing","resource allocation","instruction sets","program compilers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unrolling-based optimizations","modulo scheduling","successive iterations overlapping","instruction-level parallelism","high-issue-rate processors","resource requirements","dependence pattern","register requirements","acyclic scheduling","IMPACT compiler","SPEC CFP92 programs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476842/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 1995-Dec. 1 1995","displayDocTitle":"Unrolling-based optimizations for modulo scheduling","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"November-December 1995","accessionNumber":"5170515","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unrolling-based optimizations for modulo scheduling","confLoc":"Ann Arbor, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00476842.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036272S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 1995-Dec. 1 1995","isNumber":"10210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3464","citationCount":"18","articleId":"476842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":476873,"authors":[{"name":"R.C.

The most prominent is the soft output Viterbi algorithm (SOVA), which can be regarded as an approximation to the optimum symbol by symbol detector, the symbol by symbol MAP algorithm. The MAP algorithm is a block detector, i.e. it requires completed reception of a terminated block of received symbols, which prevents an efficient real-time implementation. Therefore, up to now, the SOVA was considered to be the more attractive alternative. In this paper, we first introduce an algebraic formulation for the MAP. Using this formulation, a novel real-time MAP algorithm (SMAP) is derived, and it is proved that in terms of hard decoding performance, the SMAP is equivalent to the VA with path memory truncation and best state decoding. The finally presented SMAP architectures provide a competitive alternative to the known SOVA architectures for soft output decoding applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476882/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sep 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5346904","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"1","displayDocTitle":"Real-time algorithms and VLSI architectures for soft output MAP convolutional decoding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time algorithms and VLSI architectures for soft output MAP convolutional decoding","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00476882.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045637S","chronDate":"27-29 Sep 1995","isNumber":"10132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3461","citationCount":"32","articleId":"476882","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":476885,"authors":[{"name":"M.

By means of diminishing the undesired signal in the received signal through detecting the delay difference of each propagated signal at the prepositioned correlator, and by identifying the propagation profile to compensate for the distortions on the transmission channels, the RAKE receiver achieves time diversity reception to improve the robustness. This means that the correlator is significant in the RAKE receiver function. However, unfortunately the sounder is intermittently interposed in the conventional system used to measure the channel profile and loses such high compliancy as tracing the rapid fading process. It is proposed that the instantaneous cross correlation function, which is derived from the short time DFT (ST DFT), is effective in describing such rapid fading process and that the instantaneous correlator based on the instantaneous cross correlation function provides a satisfactory solution for avoiding such redundancy as interposing sounder signals.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of the short time DFT correlator to the RAKE receiver for DS/SS communication system and its BER improvement effect","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 6th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1995.476885","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 6th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3461/10132/00476885.pdf","startPage":"208","endPage":"212 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1995.476885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10132","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=476885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476885/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Application of the short time DFT correlator to the RAKE receiver for DS/SS communication system and its BER improvement effect","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5346907","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of the short time DFT correlator to the RAKE receiver for DS/SS communication system and its BER improvement effect","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00476885.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.125186S","chronDate":"27-29 Sep 1995","isNumber":"10132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3461","citationCount":"3","articleId":"476885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":476886,"authors":[{"name":"O.J.

The topic of code acquisition is an important design issue in a CDMA system that supports multimedia services. Although in isolation acquisition is a physical layer design issue, the performance of this subsystem has a strong impact on the overall system design. As an example, the system designer has to decide for bursty traffic applications whether it is more desirable to acquire on a per packet basis or is it better to transmit a low rate signal to keep the communication link in synchronism (both in terms of chip timing and power control) in between data bursts. We present an acquisition procedure, based on a differentially encoded Barker sequence as the preamble, for CDMA packet radio systems that is able to provide frame and chip synchronization simultaneously. We also introduce a two-step algorithm and a windowing technique which we found effective in overcoming the partial correlation problem. With simulation studies, we found that the new scheme outperforms other conventional schemes both under a frequency selective fading channel and a AWGN channel.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1995.476890","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 6th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 6th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3461/10132/00476890.pdf","startPage":"233","endPage":"236 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1995.476890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code acquisition in a CDMA system based on Barker sequence and differential detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=476890","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sep 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476890/","displayDocTitle":"Code acquisition in a CDMA system based on Barker sequence and differential detection","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5346912","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code acquisition in a CDMA system based on Barker sequence and differential detection","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00476890.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029619S","chronDate":"27-29 Sep 1995","isNumber":"10132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3461","citationCount":"4","articleId":"476890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":476891,"authors":[{"name":"M.O.

The parameters of this channel are used for the design of communication systems using infrared light as the carrier of information for indoor wireless communications. For many applications, we need to know the spatial distribution of channel parameters such as the received optical power and the delay spread. The simulation process that yields those results is a very time consuming process. We propose using the simulation software to train a neural network using a fraction of the required points and then use the neural network to generate the desired parameters. The results presented show the excellent capability of the neural networks to mimic the simulation software for the purpose of generating the desired set of parameters for an indoor infrared channel. The process is much faster than the simulation software and proper use of sampling set selection yields highly accurate results from the neural network.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1995.476904","startPage":"311","endPage":"315 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 6th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1995.476904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10132","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 6th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3461/10132/00476904.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of indoor infrared channel parameters using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476904/","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of indoor infrared channel parameters using neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5346926","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sep 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of indoor infrared channel parameters using neural networks","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00476904.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02867S","chronDate":"27-29 Sep 1995","isNumber":"10132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3461","citationCount":"2","articleId":"476904","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":476905,"authors":[{"name":"M.R.

There are two major limitations for establishing a wideband infrared communications link. The first and most important limit is the power requirements of such a link. The second important impairment is the intersymbol interference caused by multipath dispersion. We address the issue of designing an optimized transmission system to provide the best power efficiency for an infrared link. Important parameters that should be considered for this design and some examples of efficient link designs are discussed. The suggested designs can improve the power efficiency of an indoor infrared link up to 4 to 8 dBo while providing a smaller RMS delay spread, more robustness to shadowing and more uniform distribution of power.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1995.476905","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 6th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 6th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3461/10132/00476905.pdf","startPage":"316","endPage":"320 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1995.476905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distribution of infrared light power for indoor broadband wireless communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=476905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sep 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476905/","displayDocTitle":"Distribution of infrared light power for indoor broadband wireless communications","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5346927","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distribution of infrared light power for indoor broadband wireless communications","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00476905.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064448S","chronDate":"27-29 Sep 1995","isNumber":"10132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3461","citationCount":"3","articleId":"476905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":476907,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.C.

While the shot noise induced on the receiver photodiode by steady ambient light has been extensively described and included in system models, the interference produced by artificial light has only been mentioned as a source of degradation and quite simple descriptions have been presented. This paper presents a characterisation (through extensive measurements) of the interference produced by artificial light and proposes a simple model to describe it. These measurements show that artificial light can introduce significant in-band components for systems operating at bit rates up to several Mbit/s. Therefore it is essential to include it as part of the optical wireless indoor channel. The measurements show that fluorescent lamps driven by solid state ballasts produce the wider band interfering signals, and are then expected to be the more important source of degradation in optical wireless systems.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1995.476907","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 6th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 6th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3461/10132/00476907.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1995.476907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10132","startPage":"326","endPage":"331 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterisation and modelling of artificial light interference in optical wireless communication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=476907","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Characterisation and modelling of artificial light interference in optical wireless communication systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sep 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476907/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5346929","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterisation and modelling of artificial light interference in optical wireless communication systems","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00476907.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066532S","chronDate":"27-29 Sep 1995","isNumber":"10132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3461","citationCount":"31","articleId":"476907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":476909,"authors":[{"name":"S.

It is seen that RETWV designs can be faster than the conventional design.

A new module is introduced for the DFT of the FPGA. The proposed DFT scheme permits the uncommitted FPGA to be tested using a set of constant cardinality (C-testability) for single and multiple stuck-at fault detection, while reducing the number of required primary test pins to only one. The number of tests for the FPGA is still 8+n/sub f/ (where n/sub f/ is the number of sequential modules in a row of the array), but only one primary pin and a small amount of testing circuitry are now required. This paper also modifies the single fault test set to accomplish multiple fault detection under two multiple fault models: the multiple fault single module (MFSM) and the single fault multiple module (SFMM) models. It is shown that by appropriately changing the don't care entries in the vectors of the test set for single fault detection, 100% and nearly 100% fault coverages can be achieved under the MFSM and SFMM models respectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A row-based FPGA for single and multiple stuck-at fault detection","doi":"10.1109/DFTVS.1995.476956","startPage":"225","endPage":"233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFTVS.1995.476956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10208","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Workshop on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Workshop on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel2/3462/10208/00476956.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=476956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/476956/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Nov 1995","displayDocTitle":"A row-based FPGA for single and multiple stuck-at fault detection","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5262081","conferenceDate":"13-15 Nov. 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A row-based FPGA for single and multiple stuck-at fault detection","confLoc":"Lafayette, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00476956.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038094S","chronDate":"13-15 Nov 1995","isNumber":"10208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3462","citationCount":"19","articleId":"476956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":476962,"authors":[{"name":"G.L.

Two distinct filters in the Fourier domain are designed, a frequency filter corresponding to ridge frequencies and a direction filter corresponding to ridge directions on the basis of fingerprint ridge properties. An energy function for selecting image features, i.e. frequencies and directions, is defined by intensities of images obtained with the above filters and a measure of smoothness of the features. Using the image features which minimize the energy function, an enhanced image is produced from the filtered images. This image enhancement method is applied to fingerprint matching.

Measures of the degree to which each representation describes the input are combined to determine an input's overall membership to a state.

A TEM mode at the cavity-cable junction is assumed for the FEM truncation and system excitation. Of importance in this implementation is that the cavity unknowns are related to the model fields by enforcing an equipotential condition rather than field continuity.

The digitized models with a random process using the turning bands method are simulated for the powder of brass 70Cu/30Zn. From theoretical calculations, the value of the specific extinction cross section of the powder of brass 70Cu/30Zn is between 0.1 to 4.6 m/sup 2//g. While from the experimental measurement, the value of the specific extinction cross section is between 0.58 to 3.78 m/sup 2//g. Most of the theoretical results make a good agreement with those obtained from the experimental measurements for the cell sizes of particles in the range of 0.925 to 0.5 /spl mu/m. From the numerical calculations, it is also found that there is a resonant extinction value occuring at the resonant particle size d/sub 0/ which is approximately 2.54-n/sub p//sup -0.293/ /spl mu/m determined by a least square curve fitting method, where n/sub p/ is the number of particles. The resonant value calculated by the numerical solution is larger than the maximum value obtained from the experimental measurement. The work has applications to military smoke screening.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/10162/00477188.pdf","startPage":"1321","endPage":"1324","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/36.477188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.477188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10162","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=477188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Infrared extinction of the powder of brass 70Cu/30Zn calculated by the FDTD and turning bands methods [military smoke screening applications]","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Powders","Resonance","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Least squares approximation","Frequency","Random processes","Turning","Particle measurements","Size measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brass","zinc alloys","copper alloys","finite difference time-domain analysis","least squares approximations","powders","particle size","light scattering","military systems","light absorption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brass","turning bands methods","powder","specific extinction cross section","finite-difference time-domain method","cubical particles","cell sizes","infrared frequency","digitized models","random process","resonant extinction value","resonant particle size","least square curve fitting method","numerical solution","smoke screening","military applications","0.025 to 0.5 mum","CuZn"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/477188/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1995","displayDocTitle":"Infrared extinction of the powder of brass 70Cu/30Zn calculated by the FDTD and turning bands methods [military smoke screening applications]","volume":"33","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","accessionNumber":"5165645","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Infrared extinction of the powder of brass 70Cu/30Zn calculated by the FDTD and turning bands methods [military smoke screening applications]","sourcePdf":"00477188.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039755S","chronDate":"Nov 1995","isNumber":"10162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"5","articleId":"477188","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":477189,"authors":[{"name":"C.R.

The new technique which uses current-mode circuits is based on processing signal currents, rather than handling DC tail currents, to achieve a constant-g/sub m/. Two cases are developed. One is based on processing signal currents (the AC case) while the other is based on processing total instantaneous currents (the TIC case). The adopted design strategy in both cases is universal in that it is independent of the input stage transistor types (FET or bipolar) and their operating regions. It also considerably simplifies the design procedure of low-voltage op amps. To demonstrate the new concepts, universal op amp input stage architectures have been developed and their performances have been verified in both MOS and bipolar design examples. The MOS designs have been verified in both weak and strong inversion. The proposed universal implementations achieve almost constant-g/sub m/, independent of the common mode input voltage range from rail-to-rail.","doi":"10.1109/81.477199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.477199","startPage":"886","endPage":"895","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/10160/00477199.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Universal constant-g/sub m/ input-stage architectures for low-voltage op amps","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1995","displayDocTitle":"Universal constant-g/sub m/ input-stage architectures for low-voltage op amps","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"42","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5167897","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/477199/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Universal constant-g/sub m/ input-stage architectures for low-voltage op amps","sourcePdf":"00477199.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032322S","chronDate":"Nov 1995","isNumber":"10160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"48","articleId":"477199","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":477200,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The proposed prototype oscillator was fabricated in a 2 /spl mu/m n-well CMOS process and occupies 0.281 mm/sup 2/ including a 100 pf capacitor which takes 77.8% (0.219 mm/sup 2/) of the total area. Experimental results show a frequency of oscillation as low as 0.3 Hz and a power consumption of around 0.24 /spl mu/W at 0.3 Hz to 0.3 /spl mu/W at 100 Hz with a 2 V supply voltage.","doi":"10.1109/81.477208","startPage":"962","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/10160/00477208.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.477208","endPage":"966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A very low frequency, micropower, low voltage CMOS oscillator for noncardiac pacemakers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/477208/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1995","displayDocTitle":"A very low frequency, micropower, low voltage CMOS oscillator for noncardiac pacemakers","volume":"42","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5167906","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A very low frequency, micropower, low voltage CMOS oscillator for noncardiac pacemakers","sourcePdf":"00477208.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043394S","chronDate":"Nov 1995","isNumber":"10160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"40","articleId":"477208","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":477209,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

In this study, new schedulability conditions are presented for homogeneous multiprocessor systems where individual processors execute the rate-monotonic scheduling algorithm. The conditions are used to develop new strategies for assigning real-time tasks to processors. The performance of the new strategies is shown to be significantly better than suggested by the existing literature.

The paper first introduces the notion of (m, k)-firm deadlines to better characterize the timing constraints of real-time streams. More specifically, a stream is said to have (m, k)-firm deadlines if at least m out of any k consecutive customers must meet their deadlines. A stream with (m, k)-firm deadlines experiences a dynamic failure if fewer than m out of any k consecutive customers meet their deadlines. The paper then proposes a priority-based policy for scheduling N such streams on a single server to reduce the probability of dynamic failure. The basic idea is to assign higher priorities to customers from streams that are closer to a dynamic failure so as to improve their chances of meeting their deadlines. The paper proposes a heuristic for assigning these priorities. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated through simulation under various customer arrival and service patterns. The scheme is compared to a conventional scheme where all customers are serviced at the same priority level and to an imprecise computation model approach. The evaluation shows that substantial reductions in the probability of dynamic failure are achieved when the proposed policy is used.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.477249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10166","startPage":"1443","endPage":"1451","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/10166/00477249.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dynamic priority assignment technique for streams with (m, k)-firm deadlines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/477249/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A dynamic priority assignment technique for streams with (m, k)-firm deadlines","publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","accessionNumber":"5158178","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"44","issue":"12","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dynamic priority assignment technique for streams with (m, k)-firm deadlines","sourcePdf":"00477249.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029127S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"313","articleId":"477249","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":477264,"authors":[{"name":"H.

These receivers, realized in field-effect-transistor-self-electrooptic-effect device (FET-SEED) technology, are high impedance FET-based receivers designed to operate with two optical beams in prototype smart-pixel systems. Single-ended data can be supplied to these devices by operating them, with a clock beam on one detector and a signal beam on the other detector in a return-to-zero (RZ) format. We find that with the use of this clock beam, the receiver can operate successfully with optical data having contrast ratios less than 2 at rates as high as 300 Mb/s, or at sensitivities as high as 20 fJ at 300 Mb/s. Simple models of the thresholding behavior of the circuit explain this result.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diodes","Optical receivers","Optical beams","Clocks","Impedance","Optical design","Prototypes","Signal detection","Optical sensors","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field effect integrated circuits","integrated optoelectronics","SEEDs","sensitivity","optical receivers","clocks","smart pixels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diode-clamped FET-SEED optical receivers","low-contrast single-ended signals","contrast ratio","field-effect-transistor-self-electrooptic-effect device","FET-SEED","high impedance FET-based receivers design","optical beams","smart-pixel systems","single-ended data","clock beam","signal beam","return-to-zero format","contrast ratios","sensitivities","thresholding behavior","300 Mbit/s","20 fJ"]}],"doi":"10.1109/68.477292","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/10207/00477292.pdf","startPage":"1489","endPage":"1491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.477292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Operation of diode-clamped FET-SEED optical receivers with low-contrast single-ended signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=477292","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Operation of diode-clamped FET-SEED optical receivers with low-contrast single-ended signals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/477292/","volume":"7","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5167243","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Operation of diode-clamped FET-SEED optical receivers with low-contrast single-ended signals","sourcePdf":"00477292.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025502S","chronDate":"Dec.  1995","isNumber":"10207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"3","articleId":"477292","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":477294,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.J.

The authors show that the contribution of a given electromagnetic field component is different depending on the particular adopted formulation, To show that, the three formulations are employed to calculate the voltages induced on an overhead line by a nearby lightning strike, and the contribution to the induced voltage of the various electromagnetic field components explicitly appearing in each formulation is emphasized. The authors conclude that it is misleading to speak about the contribution of a given electromagnetic field component to the total induced voltages without first specifying the coupling formulation one is using.","doi":"10.1109/15.477334","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel1/15/10168/00477334.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/15.477334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10168","startPage":"505","endPage":"508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the contribution of the electromagnetic field components in field-to-transmission line interaction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=477334","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the contribution of the electromagnetic field components in field-to-transmission line interaction","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/477334/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","accessionNumber":"5158154","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the contribution of the electromagnetic field components in field-to-transmission line interaction","sourcePdf":"00477334.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032575S","chronDate":"Nov 1995","isNumber":"10168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"63","articleId":"477334","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":477336,"authors":[{"name":"Z.S.

We have conservatively estimated that for a wide range of solutions, the CHAMP MCM offers a cumulative 100:1 improvement in size, weight, power, cycle time and cost compared to state of the art, individually packaged DSPs and microprocessors on custom PCBs. The MCM design approach, implementation tradeoffs and experimental results for various measured performance parameters are also given.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Packaging","Field programmable gate arrays","Application specific processors","Algorithm design and analysis","Hardware","Computer architecture","Prototypes","State estimation","Costs","Digital signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichip modules","field programmable gate arrays","computer architecture","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["common processor element packaging","CHAMP","application specific processors","common JEDEC MCM","multi chip module","common I/O scheme","MCM level","module reuse","Xilinx XC4025 FPGA","field programmable gate array","Configurable Hardware Algorithm Mappable Preprocessor","common processor element packaging strategy","microprocessors","custom PCBs","MCM design approach","measured performance parameters"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FPGA.1995.477407","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE Symposium on FPGAs for Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE Symposium on FPGAs for Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel2/3466/10212/00477407.pdf","startPage":"39","endPage":"44","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPGA.1995.477407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Common processor element packaging for CHAMP","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=477407","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Common processor element packaging for CHAMP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/477407/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5162746","conferenceDate":"19-21 April 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Apr 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Common processor element packaging for CHAMP","confLoc":"Napa Valley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00477407.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030263S","chronDate":"19-21 Apr 1995","isNumber":"10212","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3466","citationCount":"3","articleId":"477407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":477411,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Partial RTR extends this approach by partitioning these stages and designing their circuit modules such that they exhibit a high degree of functional and physical commonality. Transitioning between configurations can then be accomplished by updating only the differences between configurations.

Since the computation and communication pattern in a convolution operation is regular, a number of special architectures have been designed and implemented for this operator.

We combine the advantages of systolic algorithms with the low cost of developing application specific designs using field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to build a scalable convolver for use in computer vision systems. The performance of the systolic algorithm of (Kung et al., 1981) is compared theoretically and experimentally with many other convolution algorithms reported in the literature.

The situation which prevails today is that component manufacturers supply to end users experimental data which characterizes the thermal behavior of packages under a set of standardized and idealized conditions. Such characterizations normally involve the junction-to-case thermal resistance or the junction-to-ambient resistance according to MIL or SEMI standards. There are several practical difficulties associated with such an approach, which will be shortly commented upon. Today, the need for more accurate junction temperature prediction becomes increasingly urgent, and the call for a precise definition of the various thermal resistances is heard by a growing number of researchers. An earlier paper discussed the pros and cons of several methods that describe the thermal behavior of electronic parts. It was concluded that none of these methods is capable of meeting the objectives that are proposed. In this paper, a novel approach is introduced, based on the derivation of a simple resistance network starting from a detailed model, using optimization techniques. The proposed method is applied to two cases:a so-called \"validation\" chip, functioning as a benchmark for the software that is used to generate the detailed model; and a 208-PQFP component. It is demonstrated that it is possible to create a compact model comprising a simple resistance network, representing the detailed model to a high accuracy, which is independent of the boundary conditions.","doi":"10.1109/95.477457","startPage":"723","endPage":"731","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part A","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/95.477457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10163","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part A","pdfPath":"/iel4/95/10163/00477457.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal characterization of electronic devices with boundary condition independent compact models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/477457/","displayDocTitle":"Thermal characterization of electronic devices with boundary condition independent compact models","volume":"18","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5163448","publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal characterization of electronic devices with boundary condition independent compact models","sourcePdf":"00477457.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03188S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10163","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"95","citationCount":"60","articleId":"477457","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":477465,"authors":[{"name":"D.T.

An equivalent discrete-time channel representation, which can be realized by a FIR filter with time-variant tap gains, is employed. In the proposed method, the tap gains are generated from a linear transformation of a set of orthogonal zero-mean complex Gaussian random processes. By the central limit theorem, each random process is approximated by summing a finite number of randomly generated phasors (Monte Carlo approximation). When compared with the tap gain generation method, which approximates the physical channel by the Monte Carlo approximation first and then generates the tap gain values, the proposed method demonstrates a considerable reduction in the required simulation time as well as improved accuracy under similar conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/10164/00477492.pdf","startPage":"2907","endPage":"2913","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.477492","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.477492","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10164","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=477492","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient simulation of digital transmission over WSSUS channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Rayleigh channels","Finite impulse response filter","Monte Carlo methods","Digital communication","Random processes","Random number generation","Communication systems","Delay","Rayleigh scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipath channels","Rayleigh channels","fading","electromagnetic wave scattering","FIR filters","filtering theory","Gaussian processes","random processes","approximation theory","Monte Carlo methods","digital radio","digital simulation","simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital transmission","WSSUS channels","Monte Carlo method","digital communication","multipath Rayleigh fading channel","wide-sense-stationary uncorrelated-scattering channel","discrete-time channel representation","FIR filter","time-variant tap gains","linear transformation","orthogonal zero-mean complex Gaussian random processes","central limit theorem","randomly generated phasors","Monte Carlo approximation","tap gain generation method","simulation time reduction","accuracy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/477492/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","displayDocTitle":"Efficient simulation of digital transmission over WSSUS channels","volume":"43","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","accessionNumber":"5165547","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient simulation of digital transmission over WSSUS channels","sourcePdf":"00477492.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032191S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"43","articleId":"477492","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":477493,"authors":[{"name":"G.

First, the authors present and analyze a concatenated coding scheme consisting of an inner trellis code and outer block code when applied to DMT modulation, and address some of the implementation issues associated with this scheme. Some laboratory test results for a DMT prototype employing the coding scheme are presented. Next, they propose a method for applying Forney's trellis shaper across the tones in a DMT system to realize significant shaping gain. To illustrate the coding and shaping gains achieved, they use scenarios indicative of the newly introduced asymmetric digital subscriber line service.

The approach is based on a global mean squared error minimization between the input to the predistorter and the output of the power amplifier, rather than on the elimination of the cubic term. In this manner, two advantages are obtained. Firstly, the off-band distortion terms are reduced so that it is possible to eliminate the HF transmission filter. Secondly, the interference produced by the nonlinear distortion can be uniformly distributed over the entire constellation so that it is possible to reduce the back-off value of the HPA.

To obtain these speed-up factors, the IS parameters specifying the simulation probability density function (PDF) must be carefully chosen. With the increased complexity in communication systems, analytical optimization of the IS parameters can be virtually impossible. We present a new IS optimization algorithm based on stochastic gradient techniques. The formulation of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm is more general and system-independent than other existing IS methodologies, and its applicability is not restricted to a specific PDF or biasing scheme. The effectiveness of the SGD algorithm is demonstrated by two examples of communication systems where the IS techniques have not been applied before. The first example is a communication system with diversity combining, slow nonselective Rayleigh fading channel, and noncoherent envelope detection. The second example is a binary baseband communication system with a static linear channel and a recursive least square (RLS) linear equalizer in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN).","doi":"10.1109/26.477500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.477500","startPage":"2975","endPage":"2985","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/10164/00477500.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic gradient optimization of importance sampling for the efficient simulation of digital communication systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic gradient optimization of importance sampling for the efficient simulation of digital communication systems","publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"43","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5165555","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/477500/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic gradient optimization of importance sampling for the efficient simulation of digital communication systems","sourcePdf":"00477500.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037255S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"24","articleId":"477500","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":477501,"authors":[{"name":"Lang Tong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"lastName":"Lang Tong","id":"37276976900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"477501","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=477501","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Viterbi algorithm","Blind equalizers","Mobile communication","Diversity reception","Convergence","Intersymbol interference","Modeling","Adaptive equalizers","Decision feedback equalizers","Multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","estimation theory","maximum likelihood estimation","time-varying channels","correlation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind sequence estimation","data sequence estimation","received signal","transmission channel","second order statistical properties","algebraic structure","deterministic correlation estimator","optimal source correlation estimator","Viterbi algorithm","time varying channels"]}],"abstract":"Estimating the data sequence from the received signal without knowing the transmission channel is referred to as blind sequence estimation.

The LLN is a fiber optic network which performs only linear operations on optical signals: power combining, splitting and possibly linear optical amplification. The LLN can be partitioned into several subnets where each subnet is a tree providing full broadcast among all stations connected to it. We study the synchronization problem that exists in these subnets which prevents efficient implementation of time division multiple access schemes for sharing a common broadcast medium. A solution to this problem is proposed, based on a new optical signal routing scheme, called rooted routing. The impact of rooted routing on power losses is analyzed, and an approach for minimizing power loss in LLNs with rooted routing is presented. It is shown that when link and excess losses are small, rooted routing power budget can be made close to the power budget yielded by the original, shortest path routing scheme. It is also shown that rooted routing power budget can be significantly improved using a single optical amplifier.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/477503/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","volume":"43","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5165558","displayDocTitle":"A new optical signal routing scheme for linear lightwave networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new optical signal routing scheme for linear lightwave networks","sourcePdf":"00477503.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041218S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","articleId":"477503","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":477504,"authors":[{"name":"L.B.

The results quantify the loss of near-far resistance due to parameter estimation errors and demonstrate that detectors which are optimal for ideal conditions are often more sensitive to parameter mismatch. Examples are given which illustrate a reverse ordering of the symbol error rates for these detectors in the high signal-to-noise regime, and also illustrate cases when the conventional matched filter detector exhibits superior performance over multiuser detectors.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/10164/00477511.pdf","startPage":"3080","endPage":"3089","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.477511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.477511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10164","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=477511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser detection in mismatched multiple-access channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Detectors","Error analysis","Additive white noise","Degradation","Estimation error","Sampling methods","Quantization","Parameter estimation","Matched filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-access systems","Gaussian channels","parameter estimation","signal sampling","quantisation (signal)","error statistics","approximation theory","maximum likelihood detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mismatched multiple-access channels","multiuser detection","additive white Gaussian noise channel","multiuser detectors","imperfect knowledge","channel parameters","estimation errors","sampling","quantization","sufficient statistics","symbol error rates","asymptotic multiuser efficiencies","approximated channel parameters","asynchronous users","near-far resistance loss","parameter estimation errors","parameter mismatch","reverse ordering","high signal-to-noise","matched filter detector","performance","maximum likelihood sequence detector"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/477511/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser detection in mismatched multiple-access channels","volume":"43","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","accessionNumber":"5165566","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser detection in mismatched multiple-access channels","sourcePdf":"00477511.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064177S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"30","articleId":"477511","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":477522,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The present study extends these investigations to a finite array of filamentary scatterers located on the surface of an infinitely extended dielectric slab, thereby parameterizing (Floquet mode)-(leaky mode) interaction as a classifier of the more complicated phenomenology in this composite configuration. The outcome is an OBP with two separate constituents that can be interpreted, respectively, as slab-modified Floquet scattering by the truncated array and as truncated-Floquet-induced excitation of slab-guided leaky waves. This new OBP for the composite problem is validated by comparison with reference solutions generated numerically, its relevance to wave-oriented data processing is demonstrated in the companion paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/477522/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1996","volume":"44","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"5179643","publicationDate":"Jan. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"High-frequency fields excited by truncated arrays of nonuniformly distributed filamentary scatterers on an infinite dielectric slab: parameterizing (leaky mode)-(Floquet mode) interaction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-frequency fields excited by truncated arrays of nonuniformly distributed filamentary scatterers on an infinite dielectric slab: parameterizing (leaky mode)-(Floquet mode) interaction","sourcePdf":"00477522.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032949S","chronDate":"Jan 1996","isNumber":"10171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"32","articleId":"477522","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":477525,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

The technological motivation far the development of these various structures, based in particular on field sensitivity as an important figure of merit, and their limitations is discussed. Although DMLs are shown to possess the highest sensitivity, 1.2%/Oe, it is shown that they are limited by noise. Various issues affecting the implementation of NiFe/Ag DML sensors are addressed with particular emphasis on noise, since presently noise gates the development of a successful sensor. The MR characteristics of DML sensors are examined as a function of different biasing schemes to reduce noise and improve linearity. It is shown that the transverse response of ten-layer DML sensors when transversely biased may give acceptable noise performance. This represents one of the two fundamental approaches to the reduction of noise in NiFe/Ag MLs, i.e. one based on the concept of increasing the number of easily switchable ferromagnetic \"grains\" in the structure. The other approach is based on the concept of a sensor consisting of single large domains in each NiFe layer which provided the impetus for the development of patterned multilayer (PML) devices. Finally, the GMR response of these PML structures is briefly discussed.","doi":"10.1109/20.477564","startPage":"142","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/10172/00477564.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.477564","endPage":"148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overview of progress in giant magnetoresistive sensors based on NiFe/Ag multilayers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/477564/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1996","displayDocTitle":"Overview of progress in giant magnetoresistive sensors based on NiFe/Ag multilayers","volume":"32","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5185933","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overview of progress in giant magnetoresistive sensors based on NiFe/Ag multilayers","sourcePdf":"00477564.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054436S","chronDate":"Jan.  1996","isNumber":"10172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"18","articleId":"477564","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":477565,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

However, in deep submicron (/spl les/0.25 /spl mu/m gate length) technology, the combination of the extremely thin gate oxides (t/sub ox//spl les/10 nm) and high channel doping levels (/spl ges/10/sup 17/ cm/sup -3/) results in transverse electric fields at the Si/SiO/sub 2/ interface that are sufficiently large, even near threshold, to quantize electron motion perpendicular to the interface. This phenomenon is well known and begins to have an observable impact on room temperature deep submicron MOS device performance when compared to the traditional classical predictions which do not take into account these quantum mechanical effects. Thus, for accurate and efficient device simulations, these effects must be properly accounted for in today's widely used moment-based device simulators. This paper describes the development and implementation into PISCES of a new computationally efficient three-subband model that predicts both the quantum mechanical effects in electron inversion layers and the electron distribution within the inversion layer. In addition, a model recently proposed by van Dort et al. (1994) has been implemented in PISCES. By comparison with self-consistent calculations and previously published experimental data, these two different approaches for modeling the electron inversion layer quantization are shown to be adequate in order to both accurately and efficiently simulate many of the effects of quantization on the electrical characteristics of N-channel MOS transistors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/477597/","volume":"43","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1996","accessionNumber":"5173181","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1996","displayDocTitle":"A computationally efficient model for inversion layer quantization effects in deep submicron N-channel MOSFETs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A computationally efficient model for inversion layer quantization effects in deep submicron N-channel MOSFETs","sourcePdf":"00477597.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04167S","chronDate":"Jan 1996","isNumber":"10174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"92","articleId":"477597","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":477603,"authors":[{"name":"R.S.

A physical model is presented which describes the majority of the excess low-level leakage currents in terms of the charging and discharging of traps previously generated by the high voltage stress. Excess low-level leakage currents measured with voltage pulses with polarity opposite to that of the stress voltage are found to contain an additional current component, which is explained by the transient charging and discharging of certain traps inside the oxide. Evidence is presented which suggests that an oxide trap generated by the high-voltage stress can contain either a positive or a negative charge, in addition to being neutral and that the traps are located near both oxide interfaces. All of the trap charging and discharging currents can be explained by the flow of electrons into and out of traps generated by the high voltage stress, without resorting to the flow of holes in the oxide.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/477603/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1996","volume":"43","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1996","accessionNumber":"5173187","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"The charging and discharging of high-voltage stress-generated traps in thin silicon oxide","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The charging and discharging of high-voltage stress-generated traps in thin silicon oxide","sourcePdf":"00477603.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060596S","chronDate":"Jan 1996","isNumber":"10174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"45","articleId":"477603","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":477707,"authors":[{"name":"P.S.

Although our experiments were performed on a Sun SPARCstation LX, many of the techniques and conclusions will apply to other processors and error detection codes.

Source rate modulation techniques have been used in the past in designing fixed rate video encoders used over telephone networks. In such constant bit rate encoders, the source rate modulation is done using feedback information about the occupancy of a local buffer. Thus, the feedback information is available instantaneously to the encoder. In the scheme proposed, the feedback may be delayed by several frames because it comes from an intermediate switching node of a packet switched network. The paper shows the proposed scheme performs quite well despite this delay in feedback. We believe the use of such schemes will simplify the architecture used for supporting real time video services in future nationwide gigabit networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/477713/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","volume":"3","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"5175410","publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive congestion control scheme for real time packet video transport","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive congestion control scheme for real time packet video transport","sourcePdf":"00477713.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055756S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"149","articleId":"477713","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":477715,"authors":[{"name":"Jianxu Shi","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Coniputer Science, University of Texas, Dallas, Dallas, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Jianxu Shi","id":"37346883500"},{"name":"J.P.

We propose a graph based network model that takes into account the dependencies among the different objects in the telecommunication environment and a novel approach to estimate the domain of an alarm. Based on that model, we design an algorithm for fault diagnosis and analyze its performance with respect to the accuracy of the fault hypotheses it provides. We also propose and analyze a fault diagnosis algorithm suitable for systems for which an independent failure assumption is valid.

Under this approach the process of reducing total weighted cost of spare capacity is obtained by taking into account all network's eligible restoration routes which do not violate a predetermined hop-limit value. The process derived considers a given set of possible failure scenarios, which include single-link, multi-link and node failures, and is adaptive to accommodate several practical considerations such as integrality of spare channels and modularity of transmission systems. This process is generally composed of two parts: part 1 relies on a linear-programming formulation (min-max) from which a lower bound solution of spare cost is found; part 2 rounds-up the solution of part 1 to a feasible solution and uses a series of max-flow tests aimed at tightening the rounded-up assignment to a practical optimum. For small and moderate size networks a mixed-integer-programming formulation of part 1 can be used to obtain optimal results. A network, which has already been studied in the literature, is analyzed to illustrate the approach developed and to demonstrate, for cases where hop limits can feasibly be kept low, its superiority over other algorithms published in this area.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/10177/00477723.pdf","startPage":"775","endPage":"784","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/90.477723","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.477723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10177","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=477723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The hop-limit approach for spare-capacity assignment in survivable networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Centralized control","SONET","Synchronous digital hierarchy","Asynchronous transfer mode","Australia","Cost function","Testing","Algorithm design and analysis","Linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication network reliability","channel capacity","linear programming","minimax techniques","integer programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hop-limit approach","spare-capacity assignment","survivable networks","mesh-type self-healing networks","reconfigurable network elements","transmission hubs","total weighted cost","failure scenarios","transmission system modularity","spare channel integrality","linear-programming formulation","lower bound solution","max-flow tests","mixed-integer-programming formulation","algorithms","telecommunication networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/477723/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","displayDocTitle":"The hop-limit approach for spare-capacity assignment in survivable networks","volume":"3","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","accessionNumber":"5175420","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The hop-limit approach for spare-capacity assignment in survivable networks","sourcePdf":"00477723.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063002S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"94","articleId":"477723","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":477734,"authors":[{"name":"H.M.

The V/spl Phi/T is a vertical MOSFET whose gate surrounds its channel region like a Greek-alphabetic letter /spl Phi/, fabricated through the penetration of the gate electrode (=word line) which has been formed beforehand, and the formation of the channel plug inside the penetrating hole. The V/spl Phi/T provides the 4F/sup 2/ cell. The substantial simplicity of the V/spl Phi/T process contributes to the reduction in the number of process steps. The above two features result in the drastic reduction in total chip cost. Moreover, we demonstrate that the advantages on electrical properties of the V/spl Phi/T become more prominent with proceeding of scaling down. We have indicated that the V/spl Phi/T is a promising candidate for the gigabit DRAM in terms of size, cost, and performance.","doi":"10.1109/16.477769","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel3/16/10169/00477769.pdf","startPage":"2117","endPage":"2123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.477769","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of a vertical /spl Phi/-shape transistor (V/spl Phi/T) cell for 1 Gbit DRAM and beyond","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=477769","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","displayDocTitle":"Impact of a vertical /spl Phi/-shape transistor (V/spl Phi/T) cell for 1 Gbit DRAM and beyond","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/477769/","publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5158125","volume":"42","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of a vertical /spl Phi/-shape transistor (V/spl Phi/T) cell for 1 Gbit DRAM and beyond","sourcePdf":"00477769.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06287S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"25","articleId":"477769","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":477782,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

The iterative approximation combines the numerical accuracy available from two-dimensional semiconductor device simulations with the computational efficiency normally associated with closed-form solutions. In addition, under certain process and bias conditions, the iterative solution predicts behavior not demonstrated by the closed-form equations, but verified by results obtained from device simulations. The approximation is therefore useful in the design of MOS-based circuits when quick but accurate estimations of charge-storage capacity are required. The iterative approximation is applied to estimate the charge-storage capacity of a variety of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) trench capacitor cells. Several examples comparing charge-storage capacity approximations obtained from numerical semiconductor device simulations, closed-form solutions, and the proposed iterative approximation are given for inversion-store (IST), diffusion-store (DST), substrate-plate (SPT), and stacked (ST) trench-type DRAM cells. As expected, the iterative solution consistently produces results that compared favorable to the results obtained from numerical device simulations but at a much lower computational cost.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel3/16/10169/00477782.pdf","startPage":"2217","endPage":"2225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An iterative approximation for the charge-storage capacity of MOS capacitors with an application to DRAM trench capacitor memory cells","doi":"10.1109/16.477782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.477782","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=477782","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/477782/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","displayDocTitle":"An iterative approximation for the charge-storage capacity of MOS capacitors with an application to DRAM trench capacitor memory cells","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","accessionNumber":"5158138","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"42","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An iterative approximation for the charge-storage capacity of MOS capacitors with an application to DRAM trench capacitor memory cells","sourcePdf":"00477782.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036325S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"1","articleId":"477782","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":477841,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

We propose in this paper a classification of these operators issued from the different data fusion theories with respect to their behavior. Three classes are thus defined. This classification provides a guide for choosing an operator in a given problem.

These methods were demonstrated in an application of the RBF network to the diagnosis of a range of both sudden and gradual faults in a simulated continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) process. The network was able to recognise and learn new fault conditions recursively, and also to successfully diagnose faults that had been previously encountered. The results demonstrate the potential of the approach for online fault diagnosis applications in real processes. The network can be considered as a type of process fault model which maps the process measurement space to a fault classification space. The network centres represent points in the process measurement space which correspond to transient and steady-state features of faults on the process. Further work includes investigating techniques for examining these features, either qualitatively or quantitatively, to provide a greater understanding of the network operation and the effects of process faults.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"24 Apr 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/477987/","accessionNumber":"4974031","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-24 April 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive neural network for on-line learning and diagnosis of process faults","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive neural network for on-line learning and diagnosis of process faults","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00477987.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040836S","chronDate":"24 Apr 1995","isNumber":"10053","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3387","citationCount":"2","articleId":"477987","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":477991,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

Typically, such constrained models have singularities. This paper analyzes the generic local bifurcations including those which are directly related to the singularity. The notion of a feasibility region is introduced and analyzed. It consists of all equilibrium states that can be reached quasistatically from the current operating point without loss of local stability. It is shown that generically loss of stability at the feasibility boundary is caused by one of three different local bifurcations, namely the saddle-node and Hopf bifurcations and a new bifurcation called the singularity induced bifurcation which is analyzed precisely here for the first time. The latter results when an equilibrium point is at the singular surface. Under certain transversality conditions, the change in the eigenstructure of the system Jacobian at the equilibrium is established and the local dynamical structure of the trajectories near this bifurcation point is analyzed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/478226/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1995","volume":"40","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"5158056","publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Local bifurcations and feasibility regions in differential-algebraic systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local bifurcations and feasibility regions in differential-algebraic systems","sourcePdf":"00478226.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053172S","chronDate":"Dec 1995","isNumber":"10135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"194","articleId":"478226","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":478260,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

A particular interest lies on the information flow from the analysis of visual data to language generation. We focus on how visual information can be used for grounding descriptions in the environment. In cooperation with the visual perception group of the IIFB at the Fraunhofer Institute at the University of Karlsruhe, we have shown how real world visual data in dynamic environments can be used in natural language descriptions. A model based approach is used for automatically generating 3D representations of the environment. Our current work is related to problems which occur if an agent moves through real or synthetic environments. The agent's task during its movement is to incrementally describe a route from a starting point to a destination by refering to visually obtained objects. In general, the whole complexity of AI research is involved, e.g. control laws for movement, early vision processing, high level vision, naive physics, temporal and spatial reasoning, knowledge representation, planning and language processing. In a first approach, we have implemented a software agent called MOSES who describes a path in a synthetic 3D environment. MOSES can only refer to visually obtained objects (landmarks) in the current situation. Information about the path is extracted from a map by using an incremental path finding procedure.","doi":"10.1049/ic:19950663","startPage":"3/1","endPage":"3/3","displayPublicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Grounding Representations: Integration of Sensory Information in Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel3/3394/10060/00478375.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Grounding Representations: Integration of Sensory Information in Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/ic:19950663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10060","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How visual salience influences natural language descriptions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Knowledge representation","Natural language interfaces","Natural languages","Motion-planning","Spatial reasoning","Visual system"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge representation","natural language interfaces","natural languages","path planning","spatial reasoning","visual perception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual salience","natural language descriptions","VITRA","visual translator","information flow","language generation","visual information","visual perception","real world visual data","dynamic environments","model based approach","3D representations","synthetic environments","visually obtained objects","AI research","early vision processing","high level vision","naive physics","spatial reasoning","knowledge representation","language processing","software agent","MOSES"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/478375/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"How visual salience influences natural language descriptions","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"15-15 May 1995","accessionNumber":"4981080","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How visual salience influences natural language descriptions","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00478375.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02785S","chronDate":"15 May 1995","isNumber":"10060","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3394","citationCount":"1","articleId":"478375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":478388,"authors":[{"name":"J.O.

Bayesian backprop is applied in the prediction of fat content in minced meat from near infrared spectra. It outperforms \"early stopping\" as well as quadratic regression. The evidence of a committee of differently trained networks is computed, and the corresponding improved generalization is verified. The error bars on the predictions of the fat content are computed. There are three contributors: The random noise, the uncertainty in the weights, and the deviation among the committee members. The Bayesian framework is compared to Moody's GPE (1992).

We assume that the source that generates the time series belongs to a finite set of candidate sources. Classification is based on the computation of posterior probabilities. Prediction error is used to adaptively update the posterior probability of each source. The algorithm is implemented by a hierarchical, modular, recurrent network. The bottom (partition) level of the network consists of neural modules, each one trained to predict the output of one candidate source. The top (decision) level consists of a decision module, which computes posterior probabilities and classifies the time series to the source of maximum posterior probability. The classifier network is formed from the composition of the partition and decision levels. This method applies to deterministic as well as probabilistic time series. Source switching can also be accommodated. We give some examples of application to problems of signal detection, phoneme, and enzyme classification. In conclusion, the algorithm presented here gives a systematic method for the design of modular classification networks.

The structure of the NN controller is derived using a filtered error/passivity approach. Linearity in the parameters is not required and certainty equivalence is not used. This overcomes several limitations of standard adaptive control. The notion of persistency of excitation (PE) for multilayer NN is defined and explored. New online improved tuning algorithms for discrete-time systems are derived, which are similar to /spl sigma/ or /spl epsiv/-modification for the case of continuous-time systems, that include a modification to the learning rate parameter plus a correction term. These algorithms guarantee tracking as well as bounded NN weights in nonideal situations so that PE is not needed. An extension of these novel weight tuning updates to NN with an arbitrary number of hidden layers is discussed. The notions of discrete-time passive NN, dissipative NN, and robust NN are introduced.

At the cost of the increase in the number of clock phases, the decay rate in the transition region of the filter section can be increased by adding only a few components. Therefore, the components and chip area of the designed silicon cochlea can be small. An experimental chip containing four filter sections has been designed and fabricated. The measured frequency responses from the 32-section cochlea formed by cascading nine fabricated chips are consistent with both theoretical calculation results and observed behavior of a real cochlea. Moreover, the designed silicon cochlea has the dynamic range of 67 dB in each section and a low sensitivity to process variations.

The outstar is the minimal anatomy that can interpret the classical conditioning or associative memory. It can also be served as a general-purpose pattern learning device. To realize the outstar, CMOS (complimentary metal-oxide semiconductor) current-mode analog dividers are developed to implement the special memory called the ratio-type memory. Furthermore, a CMOS current-mode analog multiplier is used to implement the correlation. The implemented CMOS outstar can on-chip store the relative ratio values of the trained weights for a long time. It can also be modularized to construct general neural nets. HSPICE (a circuit simulator of Meta Software, Inc.) simulation results of the CMOS outstar circuits as associative memory and pattern learner have successfully verified their functions. The measured results of the fabricated CMOS outstar circuits have also successfully confirmed the ratio memory and on-chip learning capability of the circuits. Furthermore, it has been shown that the storage time of the ratio memory can be as long as five minutes without refreshment. Also the outstar can enhance the contrast of the stored pattern within a long period. This makes the outstar circuits quite feasible in many applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/10170/00478401.pdf","startPage":"167","endPage":"181","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/72.478401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.478401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10170","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=478401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CMOS current-mode neural associative memory design with on-chip learning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Associative memory","Neural networks","Hardware","Circuit simulation","CMOS memory circuits","Artificial neural networks","Parallel processing","Mathematical model","Anatomy","MOS devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","analogue multipliers","content-addressable storage","neural chips","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern recognition","dividing circuits","SPICE","circuit analysis computing","integrated circuit design","circuit CAD","analogue storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS","current-mode neural associative memory","on-chip learning","Grossberg mathematical model","outstar","pattern learning device","analog dividers","ratio-type memory","analog multiplier","trained weights","HSPICE","storage time","analogue neural nets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/478401/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1996","displayDocTitle":"CMOS current-mode neural associative memory design with on-chip learning","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1996","accessionNumber":"5181053","pubMedId":"18255567","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CMOS current-mode neural associative memory design with on-chip learning","sourcePdf":"00478401.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048709S","chronDate":"Jan.  1996","isNumber":"10170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"18","articleId":"478401","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":478403,"authors":[{"name":"E.S.

In the original RBF network, the hidden node's function is to sense the trajectory of the time series and to respond when there is a strong correlation between the input pattern and the hidden node's center. This type of response, however, is highly sensitive to changes in the level and trend of the time series. To counter these effects, the hidden node's function is modified to one which detects and reacts to the gradient of the series. We call this new network the gradient RBF (GRBF) model. Single and multistep predictive performance for the Mackey-Glass chaotic time series were evaluated using the classical RBF and GRBF models. The simulation results for the series without and with a tine-varying mean confirm the superior performance of the GRBF predictor over the RBF predictor.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/478403/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1996","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5181055","pubMedId":"18255569","volume":"7","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Gradient radial basis function networks for nonlinear and nonstationary time series prediction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gradient radial basis function networks for nonlinear and nonstationary time series prediction","sourcePdf":"00478403.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026697S","chronDate":"Jan.  1996","isNumber":"10170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"93","articleId":"478403","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":478404,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This is accomplished by changing the number of the elements of the network hidden layer whenever the existing topology cannot capture the dynamics presented by the new data. The training mechanism is based on the suitably altered extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm which is simultaneously used for the network parameter adjustment and for its state estimation. The network consists of a single hidden layer with Gaussian radial basis functions (GRBF), and a linear output layer. The choice of the GRBF is induced by the requirements of the online learning. The latter implies the network architecture which permits only local influence of the new data point in order not to forget the previously learned dynamics. The continuous topology adaptation is implemented in our algorithm to avoid memory and computational problems of using a regular grid of GRBF'S which covers the network input space. Furthermore, we show that the resulting parameter increase can be handled \"smoothly\" without interfering with the already acquired information. If the target system dynamics are changing over time, we show that a suitable forgetting factor can be used to \"unlearn\" the no longer-relevant dynamics. The quality of the recurrent network training algorithm is demonstrated on the identification of nonlinear dynamic systems.","doi":"10.1109/72.478408","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/10170/00478408.pdf","startPage":"222","endPage":"228","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.478408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-line training of recurrent neural networks with continuous topology adaptation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/478408/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1996","displayDocTitle":"On-line training of recurrent neural networks with continuous topology adaptation","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5181060","pubMedId":"18255574","publicationDate":"Jan. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-line training of recurrent neural networks with continuous topology adaptation","sourcePdf":"00478408.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030574S","chronDate":"Jan.  1996","isNumber":"10170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"48","articleId":"478408","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":478409,"authors":[{"name":"G.

This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive treatment of digital implementation of CMAC NNs in closed-loop control applications. The function approximation capabilities of the CMAC NN are first established and novel weight-update laws derived that guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system. The passivity properties of the CMAC under the specified tuning laws are examined and the relationship between passivity and closed-loop stability is derived. The utility of the CMAC NN in controlling a nonlinear system with unknown dynamics is demonstrated through numerical examples.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1995.478453","startPage":"2420","endPage":"2426 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 34th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1995.478453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10222","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 34th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/3470/10222/00478453.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete-time CMAC neural networks for control applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/478453/","displayDocTitle":"Discrete-time CMAC neural networks for control applications","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"5177606","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete-time CMAC neural networks for control applications","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00478453.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053485S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec 1995","isNumber":"10222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3470","citationCount":"6","articleId":"478453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":478457,"authors":[{"name":"G.A.

Thus, when a priori information about the propagation or the geometry of the array are hardly available, the model can be generalized to a blind sources separation model. It supposes the statistical independence of the sources and their non-Gaussianity. We focus on the generalization of the sources separation problem to convolutive mixtures of wide-band sources in the frequency domain. As the N-point discrete Fourier transform of signals generally tends to be Gaussian when N tends to infinity according to the central limit theorem, we replace the independence criterion of the sources with the independence of a specific MA filtering of their DFT. The result is then an instantaneous complex mixture in time-domain and the new sources are proved to be non-Gaussian.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind separation of wide-band sources in the frequency domain","publicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1995.478484","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/3469/10217/00478484.pdf","startPage":"2080","endPage":"2083 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1995.478484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10217","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=478484","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/478484/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Blind separation of wide-band sources in the frequency domain","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5137635","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind separation of wide-band sources in the frequency domain","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00478484.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060868S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1995","isNumber":"10217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3469","citationCount":"42","articleId":"478484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":478488,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In the final stage of the algorithm, the real and imaginary parts of the ith eigenvalue of a matrix are one-to-one related to the respective direction cosines of the ith source relative to the two array axes. 2D unitary ESPRIT offers several advantages over other ESPRIT based closed-form 2D angle estimation techniques. First, except for the final eigenvalue decomposition of dimension equal to the number of sources, it is efficiently formulated in terms of real-valued computation throughout. Second, it is amenable to an efficient DFT beamspace implementation. Third, it is also applicable to array configurations that do not exhibit three identical subarrays, as long as the array is centro-symmetric and possesses invariances in two distinct directions. Finally, 2D unitary ESPRIT easily handles sources having one member of the spatial frequency coordinate pair in common.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1995.478488","startPage":"2096","publicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/3469/10217/00478488.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1995.478488","endPage":"2099 vol.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2D unitary ESPRIT for efficient 2D parameter estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/478488/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"2D unitary ESPRIT for efficient 2D parameter estimation","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"5137638","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2D unitary ESPRIT for efficient 2D parameter estimation","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00478488.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071772S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1995","isNumber":"10217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3469","citationCount":"60","articleId":"478488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":478544,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The first solution to this problem was recently reported by the author using Morse's new dynamic certainty equivalent adaptive controller to prove that global stabilization is possible if the unmodelled interconnections do not induce \"amplification of the energy of the signals in all channels\". In this paper we show that, to preserve global convergence, it is actually enough to have only one \"non-amplifying channel\". A corollary of this result is that all systems where one of the outputs is affected only by its corresponding input are decentralized adaptively stabilizable. Instrumental for the establishment of our result is the fundamental S-procedure losslessness theorem of Megretsky and Treil, together with some basic loop-transformations and D-scalings.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1995.478593","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 34th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/3470/10222/00478593.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1995.478593","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 34th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","startPage":"2956","endPage":"2961 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An energy amplification condition for decentralized adaptive stabilization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=478593","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec 1995","displayDocTitle":"An energy amplification condition for decentralized adaptive stabilization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/478593/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5177696","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An energy amplification condition for decentralized adaptive stabilization","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00478593.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037725S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec 1995","isNumber":"10222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3470","articleId":"478593","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":478609,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Jin","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems Research Laboratory,College of Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SAS, Canada"],"lastName":"Liang Jin","id":"37087337528"},{"name":"M.M.

The hierarchical approach integrates performance evaluation of protocols with their implementation.

Fine grain, low level models that capture implementation details are used for detailed evaluation of small networks and for automatic implementation on radio platforms. The design, evaluation, and implementation cycle is closed by feeding the measurements from the implementation back into the model to improve its accuracy.

However, many of the design decisions which confront a system's users involve policy alternatives. Often, variables used to represent these alternatives are not only discrete but qualitative. This work seeks to develop a simulation-optimization methodology which can operate on qualitative variables. The proposed approach is to link a genetic algorithm with an object-oriented simulation model generator. The system designs recommended by the genetic algorithm are converted to simulation models and executed. The results then guide the genetic algorithm in its selection of future designs. A simulation model generator for a class of manufacturing systems and a genetic algorithm which can interface with the generator have been developed.

Gradient estimates are obtained by the application of the infinitesimal perturbation analysis (IPA) technique. We begin with background material on stochastic approximation (SA) and the IPA technique, their potential value in finding optimal solutions to manufacturing system operation problems, and limitations concerning their applicability. Next we present our attempt to solve a real problem (the design of a partially-automated assembly line in an electronics manufacturing facility) using this approach. A sequence of models is described moving from one which embodies some restrictive assumptions through to models which more closely approximate the real system. All of the models are implemented in the SIMAN IV simulation language incorporating user-written code (written in C++) implementing the SA and IPA algorithms. We report and interpret the results obtained with the different models and close with concluding remarks on the current value of this technique in solving this kind of system design problem.","doi":"10.1109/WSC.1995.478870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10228","startPage":"857","endPage":"864","pdfPath":"/iel2/3475/10228/00478870.pdf","publicationTitle":"Winter Simulation Conference Proceedings, 1995.","displayPublicationTitle":"Winter Simulation Conference Proceedings, 1995.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSC.1995.478870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic optimization applied to a manufacturing system operation problem","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic systems","Manufacturing systems","Assembly","Throughput","Personnel","Virtual manufacturing","Sensitivity analysis","Mechanical engineering","Drives","Discrete event simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","stochastic processes","discrete event simulation","electronic equipment manufacture","production control","manufacturing data processing","manufacturing resources planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic optimization","manufacturing system operation problem","discrete-event simulation model","gradient estimates","infinitesimal perturbation analysis technique","partially-automated assembly line","electronics manufacturing facility","SIMAN IV simulation language","user-written code"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Dec 1995","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic optimization applied to a manufacturing system operation problem","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/478870/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5189405","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"3-6 Dec. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic optimization applied to a manufacturing system operation problem","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00478870.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041309S","chronDate":"3-6 Dec 1995","isNumber":"10228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3475","citationCount":"9","articleId":"478870","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":478929,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The adaptive controller acts as an add-on compensator to an existing fixed compensator, which stabilizes the feedback system. The control objective is to minimize the frequency weighted variance of the tracking position error signal in the presence of external random vibrations. The proposed adaptive control scheme was implemented on a TMS320C30 DSP board, and was tested on two different disk drives. The drives were subjected to stochastic input disturbances or random vibrations. Simulation and experimental results are in close agreement and show that the proposed adaptive scheme significantly improves the error rejection capabilities of the control system, without significantly increasing its bandwidth nor decreasing its open loop stability margins.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/478987/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec 1995","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 1995","volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5169652","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive control for disk file actuators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive control for disk file actuators","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00478987.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042939S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec 1995","isNumber":"10220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3470","citationCount":"17","articleId":"478987","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":479009,"authors":[{"name":"S.

However, such a problem is ill-posed and has no unique solution. Therefore, we can only find a solution of the problem within an equivalent class. In this paper, we clarify the equivalent classes in the blind identification problem utilizing higher-order statistics, called cumulants. Let S be the set of stable scalar transfer functions and let us define the notion of a generalized permutation matrix (abbreviated by g-matrix) over S. Then it is shown that the blind identification problem cannot be solved uniquely even if we assume input signal are white, and that we can identify the transfer function matrix only up to post-multiplication of a g-matrix. This result is applied to identifying finite impulse response systems for blind signal separation.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1995.479062","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 34th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 34th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/3470/10220/00479062.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1995.479062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10220","startPage":"715","endPage":"720 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind identification of linear multi-input-multi-output systems driven by colored inputs with applications to blind signal separation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=479062","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Blind identification of linear multi-input-multi-output systems driven by colored inputs with applications to blind signal separation","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/479062/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5169664","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind identification of linear multi-input-multi-output systems driven by colored inputs with applications to blind signal separation","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00479062.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031927S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec 1995","isNumber":"10220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3470","citationCount":"3","articleId":"479062","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":479138,"authors":[{"name":"Jung-Shan Lin","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Jung-Shan Lin","id":"37349894800"},{"name":"I.

A method for efficiently constructing a word graph is reviewed and two ways of exploiting it are presented. By assuming the word pair approximation, a phrase level search is possible while in the other case a general graph decoder is set up. We show that the predecessor-word identity provided by a first bigram decoding might be used to constrain the word graph without impairing the next pass. This procedure has been applied to 64 k-word trigram decoding in conjunction with an incremental unsupervised speaker adaptation scheme.

A major advantage of this approach is that good performance is achieved using context-independent acoustic models and requiring many fewer parameters than comparable HMM systems. This paper presents substantial performance improvements gained from new approaches to connectionist model combination and phone-duration modeling. Additional capability has also been achieved by extending the decoder to handle larger vocabulary tasks (20000 words and greater) with a trigram language model.

The framework of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is used to derive an efficient speech parametric space for noisy speech recognition, from a classical static+dynamic MFCC space. We first show that the derived LDA space can lead to a higher discrimination than the MFCC related space, even at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Then, we test the robustness of the LDA space to variations between the training and testing SNR. Experiments are performed on a continuous speech recognition task, where speech is degraded with various noise sources: Gaussian noise, F16, Lynx helicopter, autobus, hair dryer. It was found that LDA is highly sensitive to SNR variations for white noise (Gaussian, hair dryer), while remaining quite efficient for the others.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/479289/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5118602","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On the robustness of linear discriminant analysis as a preprocessing step for noisy speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the robustness of linear discriminant analysis as a preprocessing step for noisy speech recognition","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"479289.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054487S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1995","isNumber":"10215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3469","citationCount":"13","articleId":"479289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":479291,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.F.

Various fast implementations have been proposed, though to date in order to compensate all the parameters of a system it has been necessary to perform Gaussian integration. This paper introduces an alternative method that can compensate all the parameters of the recognition system, whilst reducing the computational load of this task. Furthermore, the technique offers an additional degree of flexibility, as it allows the number of components to be chosen and optimised using standard iterative techniques. The new technique is referred to as data-driven PMC (DPMC). It is evaluated on the Resource Management database, with noise artificially added from the NOISEX-92 database. The performance of DPMC is found to be comparable to PMC, at a far lower computational cost. In complex noise environments, by more accurately modelling the noise source, using multiple components, and then reducing the number of components to the original number a slight improvement in performance is obtained.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479291","publicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/3469/10215/00479291.pdf","startPage":"133","endPage":"136 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast and flexible implementation of parallel model combination","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=479291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/479291/","displayDocTitle":"A fast and flexible implementation of parallel model combination","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5118604","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast and flexible implementation of parallel model combination","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"479291.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028456S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1995","isNumber":"10215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3469","citationCount":"26","articleId":"479291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":479292,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.

We show that it is possible to implement one and only one general operator which can specialize crossover or mutation operators. We investigate this alternative. Our approach consists in inserting doubles in the population of chromosomes. This article argues that explicit mutations are unnecessary. Indeed, in dGAs without a mutation operator, chromosomes undergo the mutation effect. The dual genetic search provides a source of power for searching in a changing environment. Within this paper, a first effort is presented towards incorporating the feature of self-adaptation into GAs by using adaptive mutation rates. Finally, we study the effects of explicit mutation on a dual search space. We show that a contraction of the Hamming distance is induced from mutation. As a consequence, a dGA allows to increase the capabilities of evolution on rugged fitness landscapes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/479373/","accessionNumber":"5162200","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Genetic operators in a dual genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic operators in a dual genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Herndon, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00479373.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05639S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov 1995","isNumber":"10227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3474","citationCount":"10","articleId":"479373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":479384,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In addition, we get a further reduction to 28.8% word error by mixing the bigram and SCFG LMs. We also report on our preliminary results from using discourse-context information in the LM.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using a stochastic context-free grammar as a language model for speech recognition","publicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479396","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/3469/10215/00479396.pdf","startPage":"189","endPage":"192 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10215","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=479396","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/479396/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Using a stochastic context-free grammar as a language model for speech recognition","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5118618","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using a stochastic context-free grammar as a language model for speech recognition","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"479396.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038649S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1995","isNumber":"10215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3469","citationCount":"20","articleId":"479396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":479401,"authors":[{"name":"F.J.

In the first model, the dependence relation among the frames is determined optimally by maximizing the likelihood of the observations in both training and testing. In the second model, the dependence structure associated with each frame is described by a weighted sum of the conditional densities of the frame given individual previous frames.

The technique is based on the use of binary classification trees; we refer to the results of our analyses as diagnostic trees.

Another of FAP's important features is that it causes no delay in the input or output signals. In addition, the algorithm is easily regularized resulting in robust performance even for highly colored excitation signals. The combination of these features make FAP an excellent candidate for the adaptive filter in the acoustic echo cancellation problem. A simple, low complexity numerical stabilization method for the algorithm is also introduced.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Projection algorithms","Financial advantage program","Adaptive filters","Filtering algorithms","Least squares approximation","Resonance light scattering","Convergence","Speech","Delay","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","speech processing","echo","computational complexity","least mean squares methods","adaptive signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast affine projection algorithm","adaptive filtering algorithm","LMS like complexity","memory requirements","RLS like convergence","excitation signal","performance","highly colored excitation signals","acoustic echo cancellation problem","low complexity numerical stabilization method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=479482","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479482","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/3469/10219/00479482.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479482","startPage":"3023","endPage":"3026 vol.5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10219","publicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The fast affine projection algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The fast affine projection algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/479482/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1995","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5153561","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The fast affine projection algorithm","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00479482.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.196869S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1995","isNumber":"10219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3469","citationCount":"194","articleId":"479482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":479485,"authors":[{"name":"A.N.

In this paper, we develop and evaluate a new cepstral prefiltering technique which can be applied on the microphone signals before the actual TDE in order to obtain a more accurate estimate of the position of a source in a typical reverberant environment. The performance of a TDE system with and without cepstral prefiltering is investigated under controlled conditions via Monte-Carlo simulations. The results clearly demonstrate the beneficial effects of the new cepstral prefiltering technique on TDE performance (i.e., reduction of bias, variance and number of anomalous estimates).","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479490","publicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/3469/10219/00479490.pdf","startPage":"3055","endPage":"3058 vol.5","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cepstral prefiltering for time delay estimation in reverberant environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Cepstral prefiltering for time delay estimation in reverberant environments","isConference":true,"volume":"5","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1995","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5153569","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/479490/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cepstral prefiltering for time delay estimation in reverberant environments","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00479490.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089817S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1995","isNumber":"10219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3469","citationCount":"18","articleId":"479490","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":479497,"authors":[{"name":"J.-M.

This paper addresses the issue of robustness in utterance verification. Four different approaches to robustness have been investigated: a string based likelihood measure for the detection of non-vocabulary words and \"putative\" errors, a signal bias removal method for channel normalization, on-line adaptation technique for achieving desirable trade-off between false rejection and false alarms, and a discriminative training method for the minimization of the expected string error rate. When these techniques were all integrated into a state-of-the-art connected digit recognition system, the string error rate was found to decrease by up to 57% at a rejection rate of 5%. For non-vocabulary word strings, the proposed utterance verification system rejected over 99.9% of extraneous speech.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479529","publicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/3469/10215/00479529.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10215","startPage":"285","endPage":"288 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust utterance verification for connected digits recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=479529","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust utterance verification for connected digits recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/479529/","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5118642","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust utterance verification for connected digits recognition","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"479529.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038869S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1995","isNumber":"10215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3469","citationCount":"18","articleId":"479529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":479531,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The final goal of our work is to present a single chip solution with low power consumption for an advanced digital hearing aid based on a parameterized transformation of speech (PARTRAN). Characterization of the constituent parts of the PARTRAN algorithm shows that it is well suited for implementation on a heterogeneous architecture. The design strategy used identifies a subset for implementation on dedicated hardware, with a computational complexity roughly equivalent to the performance of a standard 10 MIPS DSP. The subset of PARTRAN implemented by PSEUDEC performs pseudo-decomposition of a 12th order LPC polynomial. An adapted algorithm displays improved dynamic range compared to the conventional solution for DSPs, calculating the amplitude spectrum rather than the power spectrum. Highly pipelined CORDIC-units optimized for the application replaces complex multiplication, trigonometric operations (for e/sup j/spl omega//) and square root (for |a|=/spl radic/(a/sub r//sup 2/+a/sub i//sup 2/)), exploiting the power of CORDIC operations in advanced DSP algorithms. PSEUDEC uses redundant data representation and bit-serial arithmetic, most significant digit first (on-line arithmetic) for efficient implementation of operators and for efficient (inter-operator) communication. The inherent nature of on-line arithmetic and the operators used allows for fast and efficient implementation even when using ordinary standard cells.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479567","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479567","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/3469/10219/00479567.pdf","startPage":"3207","endPage":"3210 vol.5","publicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PSEUDEC: implementation of the computation-intensive PARTRAN functionality using a dedicated on-line CORDIC co-processor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PSEUDEC: implementation of the computation-intensive PARTRAN functionality using a dedicated on-line CORDIC co-processor","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/479567/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1995","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5161412","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PSEUDEC: implementation of the computation-intensive PARTRAN functionality using a dedicated on-line CORDIC co-processor","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00479567.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090088S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1995","isNumber":"10219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3469","articleId":"479567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":479576,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The derivation of this array is non-trivial due to the presence of feedback loops and data contra-flow in the underlying signal flow graph (SFG). This would normally prohibit pipelined processing. However, it is shown that suitable delays may be introduced to the SFG by performing simple algorithmic transformations which compensate for the interference of crossing data flows and eliminate the critical feedback loops. The pipelined array is then obtained either by 2-slowing and retiming the SFG or by means of dependence graph scheduling and assignment, and turns out to be an improved version of the array presented in Moonen et al.

However, the device speed will be degraded as the supply voltage goes down. In this paper, we propose new algorithmic-level techniques for compensating the increased delays based on the multirate approach. We will show how to compute most of the discrete sinusoidal transforms through the decimated low-speed sequences with reasonable linear hardware overhead. For the case where the decimation factor is equal to two, the overall power consumption can be reduced to about one-third of the original design. The resulting multirate low-power architectures are regular, modular, and free of global communications. Such properties are very suitable for VLSI implementations. The proposed architectures can also be applied to very high-speed block transforms where only low-speed operators are required.","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/3469/10219/00479582.pdf","startPage":"3267","endPage":"3270 vol.5","publicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479582","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10219","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=479582","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algorithm-based low-power transform coding architectures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transform coding","Very large scale integration","Voltage","Energy consumption","Degradation","Delay","Discrete transforms","Hardware","Computer architecture","Global communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","VLSI","transform coding","delays","network topology","digital signal processing chips","CMOS digital integrated circuits","integrated circuit design","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algorithm-based low-power transform coding architectures","low-power VLSI designs","supply voltage","total power consumption","device speed","delays","multirate approach","discrete sinusoidal transforms","decimated low-speed sequences","linear hardware overhead","very high-speed block transforms","low-speed operators","signal processing","CMOS"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/479582/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Algorithm-based low-power transform coding architectures","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5161427","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algorithm-based low-power transform coding architectures","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00479582.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053763S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1995","isNumber":"10219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3469","citationCount":"7","articleId":"479582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":479591,"authors":[{"name":"G.

First, the new model contains state-dependent weighting functions responsible for transforming static speech features into the dynamic ones in a slowly time-varying manner.

Signal processing techniques based on the human auditory system have been proposed to improve ASR performance, especially under adverse acoustic conditions. The paper compares one such scheme, the ensemble interval histogram (EIH), with the conventional mel cepstral analysis (MEL). These two spectral feature extraction methods were implemented as front ends to a state-of-the-art continuous speech recognizer and evaluated on the TIMIT database (male). To characterize the influence of signal distortion on the representation of different sounds, phone classification experiments were conducted for three acoustic conditions-clean speech, speech through a telephone channel and speech under room reverberations (the last two are simulations). Classification was performed for static features alone and for static and dynamic features, to observe the relative contribution of time derivatives. The performance is displayed as percentage of phones correctly classified. Confusion matrices were also derived from phone classification to provide diagnostic information.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparative study of mel cepstra and EIH for phone classification under adverse conditions","publicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479608","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/3469/10215/00479608.pdf","startPage":"409","endPage":"412 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479608","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10215","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=479608","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/479608/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"A comparative study of mel cepstra and EIH for phone classification under adverse conditions","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5124739","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparative study of mel cepstra and EIH for phone classification under adverse conditions","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"479608.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032764S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1995","isNumber":"10215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3469","citationCount":"17","articleId":"479608","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":479610,"authors":[{"name":"E.

This is especially true for languages where there do exist a large number of inflections and compound words such as German, Spanish, etc. One way to keep up decent recognition results with increasing vocabulary is the use of other base units than simply words. Different decomposition methods originally based on morphological decomposition for the German language are compared. Not only do they counteract the immense vocabulary growth with an increasing amount of training data, also the rate of out-of-vocabulary words, which worsens recognition performance significantly in German, is decreased. A smaller dictionary also leads to 30 K speed improvement during the recognition process. Moreover even if the amount of available training data is quite huge it is often not enough to guarantee robust language model estimations, whereas morphem-based models are capable to do so.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479624","publicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/3469/10215/00479624.pdf","startPage":"445","endPage":"448 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using morphology towards better large-vocabulary speech recognition systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=479624","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/479624/","displayDocTitle":"Using morphology towards better large-vocabulary speech recognition systems","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5124748","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using morphology towards better large-vocabulary speech recognition systems","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"479624.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030675S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1995","isNumber":"10215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3469","citationCount":"21","articleId":"479624","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":479632,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Parameters that have the same property should be tied in order to represent acoustic models efficiently. This paper proposes four-level tied-structure for phoneme models. The four levels include 1) model level, 2) state level, 3) distribution level, and 4) feature parameter level. Although some techniques have been proposed for the first three levels, feature parameter tying in the fourth level is newly proposed in this paper. We found that feature parameter tying makes it possible to represent 1,600 mean vectors of multivariate Gaussian mixture HMMs by using the combination of 16 representative mean values in each dimension. Experimental results show that feature parameter tying reduces the amount of calculation required for recognition without significant degrading performance. Furthermore, we found that feature parameter tying is also effective for model training.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479643","publicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/3469/10215/00479643.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10215","startPage":"520","endPage":"523 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Four-level tied-structure for efficient representation of acoustic modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=479643","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Four-level tied-structure for efficient representation of acoustic modeling","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/479643/","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5124767","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Four-level tied-structure for efficient representation of acoustic modeling","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"479643.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043451S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1995","isNumber":"10215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3469","citationCount":"26","articleId":"479643","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":479658,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Multi-pass search strategies have been used as a means of applying simple models early on to prune the search space for subsequent passes using more expensive knowledge sources. The pruned search space is typically represented by an N-best sentence list or a word lattice. Here, we investigate three alternatives for lattice search: N-best rescoring, a lattice dynamic programming search algorithm and a lattice local search algorithm. Both the lattice dynamic programming and lattice local search algorithms are shown to achieve comparable performance to the N-best search algorithm while running as much as 10 times faster on a 20 k word lexicon; the local search algorithm has the additional advantage of accommodating sentence-level knowledge sources.","publicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/3469/10215/00479663.pdf","startPage":"576","endPage":"579 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lattice-based search strategies for large vocabulary speech recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479663","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=479663","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/479663/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Lattice-based search strategies for large vocabulary speech recognition","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5118671","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lattice-based search strategies for large vocabulary speech recognition","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"479663.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041362S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1995","isNumber":"10215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3469","citationCount":"11","articleId":"479663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":479666,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The search algorithm, based on stack decoding, uses posterior phone probability estimates to substantially increase its efficiency with minimal effect on accuracy. In particular, the search space is dramatically reduced by phone deactivation pruning where phones with a small local posterior probability are deactivated. This approach is particularly well-suited to hybrid connectionist/hidden Markov model systems because posterior phone probabilities are directly computed by the acoustic model. On large vocabulary tasks, using a trigram language model, this increased the search speed by an order of magnitude, with 2% or less relative search error. Results from a hybrid system are presented using the Wall Street Journal LVCSR database for a 20,000 word task using a backed-off trigram language model. For this task, our single-pass decoder took around 15x realtime on an HP735 workstation. At a cost of 7% relative search error, the decoding time can be speeded up to approximately realtime.","publicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/3469/10215/00479668.pdf","startPage":"596","endPage":"599 vol.1","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479668","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient search using posterior phone probability estimates","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/479668/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Efficient search using posterior phone probability estimates","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5118676","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient search using posterior phone probability estimates","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"479668.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036882S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1995","isNumber":"10215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3469","citationCount":"25","articleId":"479668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":479676,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In this framework, we introduce mechanisms that take advantage of correlations present among HMM parameters in order to maximize the number of parameters that can be adapted by a limited number of observations. We are also separately exploring the feasibility of instantaneous adaptation techniques. Instantaneous adaptation attempts to improve recognition on a single sentence, the same sentence that is used to estimate the adaptation. We show that sizable gains (20-40% reduction in error rate) can be achieved by either batch or incremental adaptation for large vocabulary recognition of native speakers. The same techniques cut the error rate for recognition of non-native speakers by factors of 2 to 4, bringing their performance much closer to the native speaker performance. We also demonstrate that good improvements in performance (25-30%) are realized when instantaneous adaptation is used for recognition of non-native speakers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/479688/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5118696","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"1","displayDocTitle":"Batch, incremental and instantaneous adaptation techniques for speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Batch, incremental and instantaneous adaptation techniques for speech recognition","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"479688.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025797S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1995","isNumber":"10215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3469","citationCount":"36","articleId":"479688","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":479689,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Liang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chin-Liang Wang","id":"37068528500"},{"name":"Ker-Min Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ker-Min Chen","id":"37349547800"},{"name":"Jin-Min Hsiung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jin-Min Hsiung","id":"38153657300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2431-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"479689","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":45},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high-throughput, flexible VLSI architecture for motion estimation","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/3469/10219/00479689.pdf","startPage":"3295","endPage":"3298 vol.5","publicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10219","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479689","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Motion estimation","Throughput","Signal processing algorithms","Motion control","Size control","Tracking","HDTV","Flexible printed circuits","Image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI","motion estimation","image matching","digital signal processing chips","CMOS digital integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI architecture","motion estimation","full-search block matching algorithm","efficiency","throughput","CMOS technology","reference block size","VLSI motion estimators","tracking range","motion vectors"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=479689","abstract":"This paper presents a new systolic VLSI architecture to realize the full-search block matching algorithm for motion estimation.

Despite the low complexity in NN training and implementation, computer simulation results show that our NN receivers can achieve near optimal demodulation performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479718","startPage":"3411","endPage":"3414 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/3469/10219/00479718.pdf","publicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decision feedback neural network coherent receivers for continuous phase modulation based on frequency domain","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurofeedback","Neural networks","Continuous phase modulation","Convergence","Demodulation","Sampling methods","Receivers","Frequency domain analysis","Discrete cosine transforms","Pulse modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous phase modulation","receivers","frequency-domain analysis","transforms","discrete cosine transforms","recurrent neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision feedback neural network coherent receivers","continuous phase modulation","frequency domain","decision feedback pre-processing","Karhunen-Loeve transform","discrete cosine transform","BP learning algorithm","training","computer simulation","near optimal demodulation performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/479718/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Decision feedback neural network coherent receivers for continuous phase modulation based on frequency domain","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1995","accessionNumber":"5153609","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decision feedback neural network coherent receivers for continuous phase modulation based on frequency domain","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00479718.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.139569S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1995","isNumber":"10219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3469","articleId":"479718","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":479724,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A single-hidden-layer artificial neural network (ANN) was employed to accomplish this remote sensing task, with radiometric observations of brightness temperatures (Tbs) as input data, to derive information about snow. Error backpropagation learning was applied to train the ANN. After learning the mapping of SSM/I Tbs to snow classes, the ANN approach showed a significant promise for identifying mountainous snow conditions. Error rates were 3% for snow-free, 5% for dry snow, 9% for wet snow, and 0% for refrozen snow, respectively. This study indicates the potential of ANN supervised learning for the inference of snow conditions from SSM/I observations. Further improvement on the application of ANN for large-scale snow monitoring can be expected by using more training data derived from both plains and mountain regions.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479728","startPage":"3451","endPage":"3454 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/3469/10219/00479728.pdf","publicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of mountain snow cover using SSM/I and artificial neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Snow","Artificial neural networks","Microwave radiometry","Remote monitoring","Image sensors","Microwave sensors","Condition monitoring","Brightness temperature","Backpropagation","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["remote sensing","geophysical signal processing","snow","backpropagation","microwave imaging","brightness","microwave measurement","radiometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mountain snow cover identification","artificial neural network","Special Sensor Microwave/Imager","radiometer","snow conditions monitoring","snow properties","single-hidden-layer artificial neural network","remote sensing","radiometric observations","brightness temperatures","input data","error backpropagation learning","mapping","SSM/I","ANN","error rates","dry snow","wet snow","refrozen snow","training data","plains","mountain regions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/479728/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Identification of mountain snow cover using SSM/I and artificial neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1995","accessionNumber":"5153617","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of mountain snow cover using SSM/I and artificial neural network","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00479728.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037768S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1995","isNumber":"10219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3469","citationCount":"2","articleId":"479728","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":479729,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Hsien Wu","affiliation":["Institute of Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chung-Hsien Wu","id":"37087208072"},{"name":"Ching-Wen Lo","affiliation":["Institute of Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Wen Lo","id":"37087857131"},{"name":"Jhing-Fa Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jhing-Fa Wang","id":"37087001944"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2431-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"479729","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer aided analysis","Neural networks","Frequency domain analysis","Stethoscope","Cardiology","Computer networks","Heart beat","Cardiac disease","Information analysis","Acoustical engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["echocardiography","medical signal processing","computer aided analysis","medical diagnostic computing","multilayer perceptrons","time-domain analysis","frequency-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heart sounds","neural networks","time analysis","computer-aided heart sound analysis","computer-aided heart sound classification system","CHACS","frequency domain","time domain","multilayer perceptron neural network","heart sound patterns","heuristic rules","classification results","heart beat rate","experimental results","classification rate"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=479729","abstract":"This paper describes a computer-aided heart sound analysis and classification system (CHACS) based on neural networks and time analysis.

Since the infant cry is one of the only means that an infant has for communicating with its care-giving environment, it is thought that information regarding the state of an infant, such as hunger or pain, can be determined from an infant's cry. To date, research groups have determined that adult listeners can differentiate between different types of cries auditorily, and at least one group has attempted to automate this classification process. This paper presents the results of another attempt at automating the discrimination process, this time using artificial neural networks (ANNs). The input data consists of successive frames of one of two parametric representations generated from the first second of a cry following the application of either an anger, fear, or pain stimulus. From tests conducted to date, it is determined that ANNs are a useful tool for cry classification and merit further study in this domain.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/479734/","accessionNumber":"5153621","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Classification of infant cry vocalizations using artificial neural networks (ANNs)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of infant cry vocalizations using artificial neural networks (ANNs)","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00479734.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054508S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1995","isNumber":"10219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3469","citationCount":"25","articleId":"479734","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":479739,"authors":[{"name":"Yuh-Fwu Guu","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Yuh-Fwu Guu","id":"37088076586"},{"name":"B.

This logpolar sampling is used as a pre-processing stage in conjunction with various neural network structures.

A normalization method based on boundary crossings is also introduced, it is shown that it requires even less computations than the logpolar sampling method and has the ability of reducing the deformation effect found in handwritten characters. Over 16500 character samples are used in conducting the experiments, recognition rates of 96.24% and 95.91% (96.9697% at 374th training epoch) are obtained using logpolar sampling and normalization method respectively with a 4:1 training/testing partition.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479739","publicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/3469/10219/00479739.pdf","startPage":"3495","endPage":"3498 vol.5","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Logpolar sampling and normalization based on boundary crossing for handwritten numerals recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Logpolar sampling and normalization based on boundary crossing for handwritten numerals recognition","isConference":true,"volume":"5","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1995","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5153626","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/479739/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Logpolar sampling and normalization based on boundary crossing for handwritten numerals recognition","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00479739.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038498S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1995","isNumber":"10219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3469","articleId":"479739","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":479753,"authors":[{"name":"O.

According to the propagation model of plane waves, the network has to relate the delays between sensors to enable source localisation.

Sonar signals display a strong time varying characteristic. Although the neural net has been successful in classifying transient like sonar signals, the success is achieved either by using a bigger net architecture or by incorporating a detection mechanism in the classification procedure. The present authors propose an integrated hybrid HMM and neural net classifier where a left-to-right HMM module is used first. The HMM module segments the observation sequence belonging to every exemplar into a fixed number of states starting from the left. After this segmentation, all the frames belonging to the same state are replaced by one average frame. Thus, every exemplar, irrespective of its time scale variation, is transformed into a fixed number of frames, i.e., a static pattern. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural net is then used as the classifier for these time normalized exemplars. For successful modeling and classification, each frame is succinctly represented by a feature vector. Two feature extraction schemes are considered-the first one is based on the FFT power spectral coefficient, and the second one is based on the quadrature mirror filter (QMF) bank based subband decomposition. Finally, some experimental results are provided to demonstrate the superiority of the hybrid integrated classifier.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/479762/","accessionNumber":"5161449","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An integrated hybrid neural network and hidden Markov model classifier for sonar signal classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An integrated hybrid neural network and hidden Markov model classifier for sonar signal classification","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00479762.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0453S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1995","isNumber":"10219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3469","citationCount":"1","articleId":"479762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":479764,"authors":[{"name":"J.N.

In particular, if the synaptic weight matrix is also Hermitian (symmetric for real case), the UNIDANN will perform the eigendecomposition. Compared with other existing ANNs, the proposed one possesses several attractive features such as being more versatile in the sense that it is capable of performing the Schur decomposition, has a low computation time and there is no synchronization problem due to the application of an of analog circuit structure, and a faster convergence speed. Some simulations with particular emphasis at the MUSIC bearing estimation algorithm are provided to justify the validity of the proposed ANN.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479767","startPage":"3607","endPage":"3610 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/3469/10219/00479767.pdf","publicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-resolution bearing estimation via unitary decomposition artificial neural network (UNIDANN)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Direction of arrival estimation","Matrix decomposition","Artificial neural networks","Symmetric matrices","Equations","Transforms","Analog computers","Analog circuits","Convergence","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","signal resolution","neural nets","analogue processing circuits","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Hermitian matrices","convergence of numerical methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-resolution bearing estimation","unitary decomposition artificial neural network","UNIDANN","unitary decomposition ANN","Schur decomposition","synaptic weight matrix","positive definite matrix","normal matrix","dynamic equation","unitary matrix","upper triangular matrix","Hermitian matrix","eigendecomposition","low computation time","analog circuit structure","convergence speed","simulations","MUSIC bearing estimation algorithm","DOA estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/479767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"High-resolution bearing estimation via unitary decomposition artificial neural network (UNIDANN)","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1995","accessionNumber":"5161454","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-resolution bearing estimation via unitary decomposition artificial neural network (UNIDANN)","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00479767.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059718S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1995","isNumber":"10219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3469","citationCount":"5","articleId":"479767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":479769,"authors":[{"name":"G.J.

In particular it is important that observations of parameters of (context-dependent) HMMs not occurring in the adaptation data can be updated. In the regression-based model prediction (RMP) approach, sets of speaker-independent linear relationships between different parameters in the HMM set are found from training data. During adaptation, distributions with sufficient adaptation data are used to update the parameters of poorly adapted models using these pre-computed regression-based relationships. The method used Bayesian techniques to combine parameter estimates from different sources. Evaluation on the ARPA Resource Management corpus gave a worthwhile reduction in error rate with just a single adaptation sentence, and that RMP consistently outperforms MAP estimation with the same amount of adaptation data.","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/3469/10215/00479786.pdf","startPage":"684","endPage":"687 vol.1","publicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10215","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=479786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rapid speaker adaptation using model prediction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptation model","Predictive models","Hidden Markov models","Parameter estimation","Vocabulary","Bayesian methods","Error analysis","Ear","Training data","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition","speech processing","hidden Markov models","statistical analysis","parameter estimation","Bayes methods","adaptive signal processing","prediction theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speaker-independent linear relationships","rapid speaker adaptation","maximum information","adaptation data","context-dependent HMM","regression-based model prediction","training data","distributions","Bayesian techniques","parameter estimation","ARPA Resource Management corpus","error rate reduction","single adaptation sentence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/479786/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Rapid speaker adaptation using model prediction","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5118698","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rapid speaker adaptation using model prediction","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"479786.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048887S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1995","isNumber":"10215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3469","citationCount":"4","articleId":"479786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":479788,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

The point is that MAP is an intra-class training scheme while VFS is an inter-class smoothing technique. This is a basic technique for on-line adaptation which will be important in constructing a practical speech recognition system. Speaker adaptation speed of the incremental MAP is experimentally shown to be significantly accelerated by the use of VFS in word-by-word adaptation. The recognition performance of MAP is consistently improved and stabilized by VFS.

The proposed algorithm uses a criterion based on the human perception. It is a variation of the well-known spectral subtraction method which is attractive because of its simplicity, but introduces an unnatural and unpleasant residual noise. The proposed approach incorporates in this method considerations about noise masking of the auditory system. It succeeds in finding the best trade-off between noise reduction and speech distortion in a perceptual sense. Simulations show perceptually very satisfactory results and objective measures indicate a quality improvement. The speech processed with this new algorithm sounds more pleasant to a human listener than those obtained by the classical methods. This shows the relevance to incorporate perceptual aspects in the enhancement process.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479814","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/3469/10215/00479814.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479814","publicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","startPage":"796","endPage":"799 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speech enhancement based on masking properties of the auditory system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=479814","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Speech enhancement based on masking properties of the auditory system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/479814/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5124776","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech enhancement based on masking properties of the auditory system","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"479814.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030554S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1995","isNumber":"10215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3469","citationCount":"20","articleId":"479814","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":479815,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A great number of techniques have been already put forward and for a few years an auditory model has been investigated in noise reduction. A new approach for enhancing a speech signal degraded by uncorrelated stationary additive noise is developed. In this approach the simultaneous masking effect of the human ear is exploited. Two states \"noise masked/noise unmasked\" are derived from a noise masking threshold computed using a rough estimate of the speech signal. Then a speech signal estimator is proposed as a weighted sum of the individual estimators in each state. The gain in the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and a distortion measure indicate some improvement in real noise conditions. Subjectively this improvement is noticeable only at high input SNRs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/479815/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1995","volume":"1","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5124777","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing speech enhancement by exploiting masking properties of the human ear","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing speech enhancement by exploiting masking properties of the human ear","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"479815.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028877S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1995","isNumber":"10215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3469","citationCount":"15","articleId":"479815","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":479817,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Microphone arrays and beamforming can deliver signals that suppress undesired jamming signals but rely on knowledge where the signal is in space. This knowledge is usually derived by identifying the loudest signal source. Knowing who is speaking to whom and where should however not depend on loudness, but on the communication purpose. In this paper, we present acoustic and visual modules that use tracking of the face of a speaker of interest for sound source localization and beamforming for signal extraction. It is shown that in noisy environments a more accurate localization in space can be delivered visually than acoustically. Given a reliable location finder, beamforming substantially improves recognition accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/479827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5124789","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Knowing who to listen to in speech recognition: visually guided beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Knowing who to listen to in speech recognition: visually guided beamforming","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"479827.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04119S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1995","isNumber":"10215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3469","citationCount":"11","articleId":"479827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":479828,"authors":[{"name":"J.-C.

These methods are based on the required accuracy of motion compensation for each of the different frequency subbands. For each subband, our methods prohibit inter-frame coding and switch to intra-frame coding when the estimated motion vector is not sufficiently accurate. The simple switching mechanism adopted results in a low overhead for coding the adaptation parameters while keeping the loss in coding gain negligible, compared to an unconstrained adaptive strategy in which intra- and inter-frame coding can be switched independently in each subband. The required accuracy of motion compensation is derived analytically for equally distributed pass-band signals and used throughout the paper.

This paper addresses how to utilize both the spatial and temporal information present in an image sequence to create a high-resolution video still. A novel observation model based on motion compensated subsampling is proposed for a video sequence. Since the reconstruction problem is ill-posed, Bayesian restoration with an edge-preserving prior image model is used to extract a high-resolution video frame from a low-resolution sequence. Estimates computed from an image sequence containing a camera pan show dramatic improvement over bilinear, cubic B-spline, and Bayesian single frame interpolations. Improved definition is also shown for a video sequence containing objects moving with independent trajectories.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479905","publicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/3469/10218/00479905.pdf","startPage":"2169","endPage":"2172 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved definition video frame enhancement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/479905/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Improved definition video frame enhancement","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5137657","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved definition video frame enhancement","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00479905.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079428S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1995","isNumber":"10218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3469","citationCount":"22","articleId":"479905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":479910,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This is a multi-faceted problem, which generally necessitates standards conversion and hi-res reconstruction. Standards conversion is the problem of converting from one spatio-temporal sampling lattice to another, while hi-res image reconstruction involves increasing the spatial sampling density. Also of interest is removing degradations that occur during the image acquisition process. These tasks have all received considerable, yet separate, treatment in the literature.

The problem and data are reminiscent of the local tomography problem; however, the present algorithm reconstructs the ROI of the image itself, not the filtered version of it obtained using local tomography.

Sections of an activity-driven clock tree can be turned on/off by gating the clock signals during the active/idle times of the clocked elements. We propose a method of obtaining the switching activity patterns of the clocked circuits during the high level design process. We formulate three novel activity-driven problems. The objective of these problems is to minimize system's dynamic power consumption. We propose an approximation algorithm based on recursive matching to solve the clock tree construction problem. We solve the gate insertion problems with an exact algorithm employing the dynamic programming paradigm. Finally, we present experimental results that verify the effectiveness of our approach.
