A statistical method to evaluate the scheduling gain is proposed and a proof of its convergence is given. This method is three orders of magnitude faster than full system simulation. Based on these results, a queuing theory analysis is performed and is applied to the pedestrian A 3km/h channel model and LMMSE receiver. The evaluation uses drive tests measurements to reflect the realistic distribution of radio conditions. The derived flow-level performance of PF scheduling, including blocking rate, outage rate and flow throughput, is of major interest for network operators.","doi":"10.1109/WIOPT.2011.5930005","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium of Modeling and Optimization of Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","startPage":"133","endPage":"139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIOPT.2011.5930005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5929998","pdfPath":"/iel5/5877068/5929998/05930005.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium of Modeling and Optimization of Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Throughput","Scheduling","Receivers","Channel models","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least mean squares methods","queueing theory","Rayleigh channels","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-layer analysis","scheduling gains","LMMSE receivers","frequency-selective Rayleigh-fading channels","fast statistical method","queuing theory","cellular network","proportional fair scheduling","channel model","drive tests measurements","blocking rate","outage rate","flow throughput"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mobile networks","PF scheduler","LMMSE receiver","frequency selective Rayleigh fading channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cross-layer analysis of scheduling gains: Application to LMMSE receivers in frequency-selective Rayleigh-fading channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5930005/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5930005/","accessionNumber":"12075673","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-layer analysis of scheduling gains: Application to LMMSE receivers in frequency-selective Rayleigh-fading channels","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"p133combes.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075806S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5877068","isNumber":"5929998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5877068","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5929998","articleId":"5930005","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5930008,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37716071300"},{"name":"Dongning Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Dongning","lastName":"Guo","id":"37272631900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-824-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-822-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-823-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5930008","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":468},"abstract":"A novel scheme for full-duplex neighbor discovery in wireless networks is proposed. The scheme allows all nodes to simultaneously discover one-hop neighbors and identify their network interface addresses (NIAs) within a single frame of transmission, which typically consists of no more than a few thousand symbols. The key technique is to assign each node a unique on-off signature derived from a second-order Reed-Muller code and let all nodes simultaneously transmit their signatures. Despite that the radio is half-duplex, each node observes a superposition of its neighbors' signatures (partially) through its own off-slots. To identify its (small number of) neighbors out of a large network address space, each node solves a compressed sensing (or sparse recovery) problem using a chirp reconstruction algorithm. A network of over one million Poisson distributed nodes (with 20-bit NIAs) is studied numerically, where each node has 30 neighbors on average, and the channel between each pair of nodes is subject to path loss and Rayleigh fading. Within a single frame of 4,096 symbols, nodes can discover their respective neighbors with on average 99.9% accuracy at 16 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The algorithm is scalable to networks of virtually any size of practical interest due to its sub-linear complexity. The new scheme requires much fewer transmissions than conventional random-access discovery schemes to achieve the same performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium of Modeling and Optimization of Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5877068/5929998/05930008.pdf","startPage":"154","endPage":"160","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium of Modeling and Optimization of Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","doi":"10.1109/WIOPT.2011.5930008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIOPT.2011.5930008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5929998","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5930008","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neighbor discovery in wireless networks using compressed sensing with Reed-Muller codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peer to peer computing","Chirp","Reconstruction algorithms","Signal to noise ratio","Symmetric matrices","Complexity theory","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Poisson distribution","radio networks","Rayleigh channels","Reed-Muller codes","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless networks","compressed sensing","Reed-Muller code","full duplex neighbor discovery","network interface addresses","chirp reconstruction algorithm","Poisson distributed node","path loss","Rayleigh fading"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5930008/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Neighbor discovery in wireless networks using compressed sensing with Reed-Muller codes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5930008/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12075676","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neighbor discovery in wireless networks using compressed sensing with Reed-Muller codes","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"p154zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061989S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5877068","isNumber":"5929998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5877068","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5929998","articleId":"5930008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5930013,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The optimal scheduler ends the transmission to both users at the same time.

The rank constrained problem is highly motivated by the practical consideration on the receiver complexity in current wireless systems such as LTE. We propose a unified algorithm based on fixed point iteration. The proposed approach has very fast convergence rate that usually converges to the minimal number of streams for each user and finds the corresponding optimal precoding matrix. Rank minimization is particularly desirable in practice. The order in which the users' streams are encoded is crucial when dirty paper coding is allowed. We prove that the optimal user ordering does not depend on the transmission rank constraints and is given only by the weight vector.

Applications of these results are illustrated for Rayleigh fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/WIOPT.2011.5930030","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium of Modeling and Optimization of Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium of Modeling and Optimization of Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5877068/5929998/05930030.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIOPT.2011.5930030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5929998","startPage":"294","endPage":"299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate optimal limited feedback policies for the MIMO downlink","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5930030","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Rate optimal limited feedback policies for the MIMO downlink","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5930030/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12075698","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5930030/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate optimal limited feedback policies for the MIMO downlink","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"p294inaltekin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115672S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5877068","isNumber":"5929998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5877068","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5929998","articleId":"5930030","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5930031,"authors":[{"name":"Boris Shishkin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Boris","lastName":"Shishkin","id":"38180782100"},{"name":"Doug Pfeil","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Doug","lastName":"Pfeil","id":"38576443800"},{"name":"Danh Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Danh","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37715961000"},{"name":"Kevin Wanuga","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Wanuga","id":"37712637900"},{"name":"James Chacko","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Chacko","id":"37706046000"},{"name":"Jeremy Johnson","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Johnson","id":"38560287400"},{"name":"Nagarajan Kandasamy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Nagarajan","lastName":"Kandasamy","id":"37269743000"},{"name":"Timothy P.

This platform can be used to implement current and future standards that make use of highly demanding communications techniques, including ultrawideband (UWB) radio and free-space optical communications. This paper describes the commercial and custom hardware that is being integrated into the platform, including the baseband hardware and the modular transceiver frontends. Furthermore, the paper describes the software development currently in progress with this platform, including the integration of available open source designs into the platform, and the development of custom IP for scalable OFDM PHY implementations in radio and optical communications.

The most popular medium access mechanism for such ad hoc networks is CSMA/CA with RTS/CTS. In this paper, using tools from stochastic geometry, we study and optimize the throughput performance of such networks. We show that in ad-hoc networks enabled with SIR based scheduling, a simple modification to the transmit power level - setting it to be inversely proportional to the square root of the link gain - leads to large improvements in network throughput. This simple power-level selection is optimal over the class of all \u201dlocal\u201d transmit power selection strategies when channels are stationary, and further is at most a factor of two away from optimality in the fading case. Using stochastic geometric techniques, we also provide analytical expressions for the medium access probability in different scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/WIOPT.2011.5930040","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium of Modeling and Optimization of Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium of Modeling and Optimization of Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5877068/5929998/05930040.pdf","startPage":"354","endPage":"359","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIOPT.2011.5930040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5929998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On optimizing CSMA for wide area ad-hoc networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5930040","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5930040/","displayDocTitle":"On optimizing CSMA for wide area ad-hoc networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12075708","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5930040/","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On optimizing CSMA for wide area ad-hoc networks","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"p354baccelli.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077989S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5877068","isNumber":"5929998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5877068","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5929998","articleId":"5930040","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5930041,"authors":[{"name":"Yuchul Kim","affiliation":["Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), University of Texas, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Yuchul","lastName":"Kim","id":"37311193000"},{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois Baccelli","affiliation":["Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), University of Texas, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Baccelli","id":"37282369900"},{"name":"Gustavo de Veciana","affiliation":["Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), University of Texas, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Gustavo","lastName":"de Veciana","id":"37269862400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-824-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-822-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-823-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5930041","dbTime":"36 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":410},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Multiaccess communication","Interference","Receivers","Protocols","Ad hoc networks","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier sense multiple access","mobile ad hoc networks","radio transmitters","radiofrequency interference","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile ad-hoc networks","channel-aware CSMA protocols","spatial reuse","spatial fairness","opportunistic scheduling","channel quality","scheduled transmitters","interference","channel-aware slotted CSMA protocols","opportunistic CSMA","quantile-based CSMA","stochastic geometric models","parameter optimization"]}],"abstract":"We investigate the benefits of channel-aware (opportunistic) scheduling of transmissions in ad-hoc networks. The key challenge in optimizing the performance of such systems is finding a good compromise among three interdependent quantities, the density and channel quality of the scheduled transmitters, and the resulting interference at receivers. We propose two new channel-aware slotted CSMA protocols: opportunistic CSMA (O-CSMA) and quantile-based CSMA (QT-CSMA) and develop stochastic geometric models allowing us to quantify their performance in terms of spatial reuse and spatial fairness. When properly optimized these protocols offer substantial improvements in terms of both of these metrics relative to CSMA - particularly when the density of nodes is moderate to high. Moreover, we show that a simple version of QT-CSMA can achieve robust performance gains without requiring careful parameter optimization. The paper supports the case that the benefits associated with channel-aware scheduling in ad hoc networks, as in centralized base station scenarios, might far outweigh the associated overhead, and this can be done robustly using a QT-CSMA like protocol.","doi":"10.1109/WIOPT.2011.5930041","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium of Modeling and Optimization of Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium of Modeling and Optimization of Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5877068/5929998/05930041.pdf","startPage":"360","endPage":"365","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIOPT.2011.5930041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5929998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial reuse and fairness of mobile ad-hoc networks with channel-aware CSMA protocols","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5930041","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5930041/","displayDocTitle":"Spatial reuse and fairness of mobile ad-hoc networks with channel-aware CSMA protocols","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12075709","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5930041/","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial reuse and fairness of mobile ad-hoc networks with channel-aware CSMA protocols","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"p360kim.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097374S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5877068","isNumber":"5929998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5877068","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5929998","articleId":"5930041","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-17"},{"_id":5930047,"authors":[{"name":"Curtis K.

We consider the special case of two teams with each team consisting of two mobile agents. Agents belonging to the same team communicate over wireless ad hoc networks, and they try to split their available power between the tasks of communication and jamming the nodes of the other team. The agents have constraints on their total energy and instantaneous power usage. The cost function adopted is the difference between the rates of erroneously transmitted bits of each team. We model the adaptive modulation problem as a zero-sum matrix game which in turn gives rise to a a continuous kernel game to handle power control. Based on the communications model, we present sufficient conditions on the physical parameters of the agents for the existence of a pure strategy saddle-point equilibrium (PSSPE).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5930051/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5930051/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12075719","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive resource allocation in jamming teams using game theory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive resource allocation in jamming teams using game theory","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"p395khanafer.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060959S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5877068","isNumber":"5929998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5877068","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5929998","articleId":"5930051","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5930053,"authors":[{"name":"Feilu Liu","affiliation":["ECE Department, Polytechnic Institute of NYU, Brooklyn, NY"],"firstName":"Feilu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37534556100"},{"name":"Erdem Bala","affiliation":["InterDigital Communications, South Wing, Melville, NY"],"firstName":"Erdem","lastName":"Bala","id":"37283573900"},{"name":"Elza Erkip","affiliation":["ECE Department, Polytechnic Institute of NYU, Brooklyn, NY"],"firstName":"Elza","lastName":"Erkip","id":"37266656500"},{"name":"Rui Yang","affiliation":["InterDigital Communication Corporation, Melville, NY, USA","InterDigital Communications, South Wing, Melville, NY"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Yang","id":"37291106300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-824-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-822-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-823-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5930053","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":883},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 Standards","Femtocells","Throughput","Analytical models","Macrocell networks","Sensors","Wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","femtocellular radio","frequency allocation","telecommunication traffic","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocells","unlicensed bands","cellular operators","data traffic offloading","WiFi hotspots","cellular network capacity","throughput gains","unlicensed frequency bands","coexisting femtocell","WiFi networks","fully-utilized unlicensed band","femtocell channel access parameters","cellular networks","unlicensed spectrum users"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["throughput analysis","femtocell","cognitive radio"]}],"abstract":"Cellular operators have been offloading data traffic from their licensed bands to unlicensed bands through a large number of WiFi hotspots over the past years. Although this approach improves the cellular network capacity to some extent, it falls short of getting significant throughput gains. In this paper, it is argued that femtocells, covering a short range, can be a perfect platform to jointly exploit the merits of both licensed and unlicensed frequency bands. In particular, a framework is proposed for a femtocell to simultaneously access both licensed and unlicensed bands. The performance of coexisting femtocell and WiFi networks operating over a fully-utilized unlicensed band are analytically modeled and are verified via simulations. Impact of femtocell channel access parameters on the performance of WiFi and cellular networks is also investigated, shedding light on how a femtocell can best adjust its channel access parameters to coexist with incumbent unlicensed spectrum users like WiFi networks.","doi":"10.1109/WIOPT.2011.5930053","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium of Modeling and Optimization of Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium of Modeling and Optimization of Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5877068/5929998/05930053.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIOPT.2011.5930053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5929998","startPage":"407","endPage":"411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A framework for femtocells to access both licensed and unlicensed bands","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5930053","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A framework for femtocells to access both licensed and unlicensed bands","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5930053/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12075721","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5930053/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A framework for femtocells to access both licensed and unlicensed bands","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"p407liu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047722S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5877068","isNumber":"5929998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5877068","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5929998","articleId":"5930053","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5930054,"authors":[{"name":"Ana Galindo-Serrano","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), Parc Mediterrani de la Tecnologia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Ana","lastName":"Galindo-Serrano","id":"38277739800"},{"name":"Lorenza Giupponi","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), Parc Mediterrani de la Tecnologia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Lorenza","lastName":"Giupponi","id":"37281677900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-824-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-822-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-823-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5930054","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":591},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Macrocell networks","Interference","OFDM","Pragmatics","Cost function","Downlink","Power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","femtocellular radio","frequency division multiple access","learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile computing","multi-agent systems","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink femto-to-macro interference management","fuzzy Q-learning","resource allocation","self-organized femtocells","intelligent femtocells","decentralized fuzzy Q-learning","FQL","realtime multiagent reinforcement learning techniques","RL techniques","macrocell","femtocell capacity","FQL paradigm","3rd Generation Partnership Project","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","OFDMA femtocell network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocell network","interference management","multiagent system","Fuzzy Q-Learning"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a distributed solution for resource allocation in femtocell systems in order to control the downlink femto-to-macro aggregated interference.

The performance of Round Robin (RR), maximum Data Rate Control (DRC), proportional fairness (PF), exponent DRC (expDRC), average DRC (aveDRC), and maxDRC-PF schedulers are investigated. For performance analysis, paper introduces a unique methodology which combines real femtocell network experiments with computer simulations. Data rate control (DRC) values collected through real experiments are used in computer simulations in order to assess the performance of scheduling methods in femtocell environment. Best effort (BE) and Voice over IP (VoIP) traffic are modeled and simulated in computer simulations. Schedulers' performance are measured in terms of total delivered throughput, VoIP packet delay, and throughput fairness. In conclusion, expDRC and maxDRC-PF scheduler is recommended since they have the lowest VoIP packet delay bound error, and the high throughput and throughput fairness compared to other scheduling methods.","doi":"10.1109/WIOPT.2011.5930058","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium of Modeling and Optimization of Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium of Modeling and Optimization of Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5877068/5929998/05930058.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIOPT.2011.5930058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5929998","startPage":"428","endPage":"433","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radio resource management and packet scheduling in femtocell networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5930058","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Radio resource management and packet scheduling in femtocell networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5930058/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12075726","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5930058/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio resource management and packet scheduling in femtocell networks","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"p428sevindik.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096267S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5877068","isNumber":"5929998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5877068","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5929998","articleId":"5930058","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5930059,"authors":[{"name":"Akindele Segun Afolabi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Kobe University, Japan"],"firstName":"Akindele Segun","lastName":"Afolabi","id":"37712642100"},{"name":"Chikara Ohta","affiliation":["Graduate School of System Informatics, Kobe University, Japan"],"firstName":"Chikara","lastName":"Ohta","id":"37284445900"},{"name":"Hisashi Tamaki","affiliation":["Graduate School of System Informatics, Kobe University, Japan"],"firstName":"Hisashi","lastName":"Tamaki","id":"37280264600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-824-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-822-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-823-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5930059","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":222},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Throughput","Resource management","Macrocell networks","Base stations","Power control","Schedules"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular arrays","cellular radio","interference (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["macrocell batch resource allocation","closed access","femto macro cellular wireless network","emerging technology","femtocell base stations","cross layer interference coordination","total macrocell"]}],"abstract":"Femtocell is an emerging technology that promises increased network capacity and enhanced indoor coverage at a low capital and operational cost. However, macrocell network performance depreciates when macrocell users (mUEs) are located indoors with femtocell base stations (FBSs), and these users are not allowed access to the FBSs (closed access). This is a critical issue that needs to be addressed in order to successfully deploy femtocell tier over existing macrocell networks. This paper proposes a macrocell proportional fair-based batch resource allocation strategy that enables FBS to be aware of macrocell resource usage schedule. In this context, batch means multiple time-slots. The knowledge of macrocell resource usage schedule enables the FBS to effectively mitigate interference caused to mUEs in its neighborhood. We show by simulation results that our proposed cross-layer interference coordination approach significantly increases the total macrocell throughput through interference reduction.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Macrocell batch resource allocation for a closed access femto-macro cellular wireless network","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium of Modeling and Optimization of Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","doi":"10.1109/WIOPT.2011.5930059","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium of Modeling and Optimization of Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5877068/5929998/05930059.pdf","startPage":"434","endPage":"439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIOPT.2011.5930059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5929998","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5930059","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5930059/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Macrocell batch resource allocation for a closed access femto-macro cellular wireless network","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5930059/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12075727","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Macrocell batch resource allocation for a closed access femto-macro cellular wireless network","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"p434afolabi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086783S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5877068","isNumber":"5929998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5877068","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5929998","articleId":"5930059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5930060,"authors":[{"name":"Sreenath Ramanath","affiliation":["INRIA, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Sreenath","lastName":"Ramanath","id":"37400302000"},{"name":"Eitan Altman","affiliation":["INRIA, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Eitan","lastName":"Altman","id":"37266347900"},{"name":"Konstantin Avrachenkov","affiliation":["INRIA, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Konstantin","lastName":"Avrachenkov","id":"37266454500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-824-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-822-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-823-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5930060","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":234},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Throughput","Base stations","Attenuation","Femtocell networks","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","resource allocation","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fair resource allocation","femtocell networks","alpha fairness","fair assignment","elastic traffic","file transfer","interactive voice","time scale separation"]}],"abstract":"We have recently extended the notion of alpha fairness to include time scale considerations for fair assignment of resources.

By modeling the interference from the arbitrary-distributed Femtocells as shot-noise process, the paper analyzes the effect of sidelobe interference on the system performance metrics such as transmission capacity (TC) and area spectral efficiency (ASE). The numerical results calculated for three different OFDM schemes show that, under the circumstance of very high Femto deployment intensity, the rigorous constraints on first-tier, namely the Macrocell outage probability and the reduction of first-tier ASE, prohibit the Femtocells from excessive subband access. Thus the out-of-band emissions contribute significantly to the system performance loss. Further analysis has shown that poor channel condition can even worsen the situation, making the existence of sidelobe interference not ignorable. Among the three schemes, OQAM-OFDM is proved to achieve the best performance. Although OQAM-OFDM has higher requirements of implementation, it is reasonable to be considered as one of the candidate transmission schemes for future Femtocell applications.","doi":"10.1109/WIOPT.2011.5930061","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium of Modeling and Optimization of Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium of Modeling and Optimization of Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5877068/5929998/05930061.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIOPT.2011.5930061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5929998","startPage":"445","endPage":"450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the influence of OFDM sidelobe interference on Femto rich systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5930061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the influence of OFDM sidelobe interference on Femto rich systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5930061/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12075729","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5930061/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the influence of OFDM sidelobe interference on Femto rich systems","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"p445zhao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086203S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5877068","isNumber":"5929998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5877068","xplore-issue":"5929998","articleId":"5930061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5930062,"authors":[{"name":"Sumeeth Nagaraja","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sumeeth","lastName":"Nagaraja","id":"37408643700"},{"name":"Vinay Chande","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Vinay","lastName":"Chande","id":"37371071400"},{"name":"Satashu Goel","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Satashu","lastName":"Goel","id":"37273351800"},{"name":"Farhad Meshkati","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Farhad","lastName":"Meshkati","id":"37294442500"},{"name":"Mehmet Yavuz","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mehmet","lastName":"Yavuz","id":"37337513300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-824-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-822-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-823-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5930062","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":245},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Femtocells","Interference","Macrocell networks","Radio frequency","Calibration","Downlink","Floors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","access protocols","calibration","cochannel interference","femtocellular radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink transmit power self-calibration","residential UMTS-HSPA-femtocells","cochannel macrocell network","cochannel interference","femtocell power calibration algorithm","coverage-interference tradeoff control","network listen module"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocell","downlink transmit power calibration","co-channel","coverage","interference","mobile assisted","UMTS","HSPA"]}],"abstract":"Downlink transmit power calibration is critical for femtocell deployment to achieve a good tradeoff between downlink coverage and interference impact to a co-channel macrocell network.

Indoor enterprise femtocell deployments face a single-path slow fading wireless environment that may lead to frequent hard handovers in the boundary region of neighboring femtocells and consequent degradation in the voice quality experienced by the users. In the absence of soft-handover (SHO) support, transmit diversity at the femtocell can combat single-path fading channel. We demonstrate through over-the-air tests that transmit diversity is very effective in reducing the number of hard handovers and therefore results in significant improvement in voice quality for enterprise users. On the uplink, we study system stability using an analytical approach. We derive analytical conditions for system stability with and without receive diversity at the femtocells. Using this analytical framework, benefits of receive diversity in maintaining system stability and preventing uplink power racing between neighboring femtocells are quantified. It is shown that, in the absence of SHO, receive diversity is very effective in maintaining system stability by preventing potential uplink power racing caused by inter-femto interference.","doi":"10.1109/WIOPT.2011.5930063","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium of Modeling and Optimization of Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium of Modeling and Optimization of Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5877068/5929998/05930063.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIOPT.2011.5930063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5929998","startPage":"456","endPage":"460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Benefits of transmit and receive diversity in enterprise femtocell deployments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5930063","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Benefits of transmit and receive diversity in enterprise femtocell deployments","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5930063/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12075731","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5930063/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Benefits of transmit and receive diversity in enterprise femtocell deployments","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"p456jiang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04514S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5877068","isNumber":"5929998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5877068","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5929998","articleId":"5930063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5930067,"authors":[{"name":"Longbo Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Longbo","lastName":"Huang","id":"37538422300"},{"name":"Scott Moeller","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Moeller","id":"37320577800"},{"name":"Michael J.

This result holds for general stochastic network optimization problems and general Markovian dynamics. Remarkably, the performance of LIFO-Backpressure can be achieved by simply changing the queueing discipline; it requires no other modifications of the original Backpressure algorithm. We validate the results through empirical measurements from a sensor network testbed, which show good match between theory and practice.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium of Modeling and Optimization of Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5877068/5929998/05930067.pdf","startPage":"70","endPage":"77","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium of Modeling and Optimization of Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","doi":"10.1109/WIOPT.2011.5930067","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIOPT.2011.5930067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5929998","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5930067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LIFO-Backpressure achieves near optimal utility-delay tradeoff","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Markov processes","Queueing analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Optimization","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes","queueing theory","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LIFO-backpressure","near optimal utility-delay tradeoff","stochastic network utility maximization framework","backpressure algorithm","MaxWeight","utility-optimal algorithm","LIFO queueing discipline","average delay","network traffic","stochastic network optimization problem","general Markovian dynamics","Backpressure algorithm","sensor network testbed"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Queueing","Dynamic Control","LIFO scheduling","Lyapunov analysis","Stochastic Optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5930067/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"LIFO-Backpressure achieves near optimal utility-delay tradeoff","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5930067/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12075735","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LIFO-Backpressure achieves near optimal utility-delay tradeoff","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"p70huang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080727S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5877068","isNumber":"5929998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5877068","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5929998","articleId":"5930067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5930068,"authors":[{"name":"Shreeshankar Bodas","affiliation":["Department of EECS, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Shreeshankar","lastName":"Bodas","id":"37398916500"},{"name":"Tara Javidi","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of California, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Tara","lastName":"Javidi","id":"37278949700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-824-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-822-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-823-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5930068","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scheduling for multi-channel wireless networks: Small delay with polynomial complexity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5930068","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Resource management","Delay","Wireless communication","Scheduling algorithm","Queueing analysis","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","OFDM modulation","polynomials","probability","real-time systems","scheduling","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichannel wireless networks","scheduling","delay","polynomial complexity","OFDM","wireless downlink systems","real-time traffic","stochastic traffic","probability","optimal decay rate","multipacket reception","nonzero decay rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Scheduling algorithms","wireless downlink networks","small delay","low complexity"]}],"abstract":"Scheduling for multi-channel (e.g., OFDM-based) wireless downlink systems is considered with the objective of providing low delay performance to users with real-time and stochastic traffic.

In particular, as the number of users and channels grows, the algorithm ensures an exponential decay of the probability of encountering significant delay at a near optimal decay rate when the arrivals are symmetric and the channel follows an ON-OFF model with multi-packet reception.

Building a MAC that exploits self-interference cancellation is a challenging task. Links can be scheduled concurrently, but only if they either (i) don't interfere or (ii) allow for self-interference cancellation. Two issues arise: Firstly, it is difficult to construct a schedule that fully exploits the potentials for self-interference cancellation for arbitrary traffic patterns. Secondly, designing an efficient and fair distributed MAC is a daunting task; the issues become even more pronounced when scheduling under the constraints. We propose ContraFlow, a novel MAC that exploits the benefits of self-interference cancellation and increases spatial reuse. We use full-duplex to eliminate hidden terminals, and we rectify decentralized coordination inefficiencies among nodes, thereby improving fairness. Using measurements and simulations we illustrate the performance gains achieved when ContraFlow is used and we obtain both a throughput increase over current systems, as well as a significant improvement in fairness.","doi":"10.1109/WIOPT.2011.5930070","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium of Modeling and Optimization of Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium of Modeling and Optimization of Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5877068/5929998/05930070.pdf","startPage":"94","endPage":"101","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIOPT.2011.5930070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5929998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient and fair MAC for wireless networks with self-interference cancellation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5930070","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5930070/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient and fair MAC for wireless networks with self-interference cancellation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12075738","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5930070/","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient and fair MAC for wireless networks with self-interference cancellation","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"p94singh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05238S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5877068","isNumber":"5929998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5877068","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"5929998","articleId":"5930070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5930093,"authors":[{"name":"Kanatorn Jindarak","affiliation":["HPCNC, Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Kanatorn","lastName":"Jindarak","id":"37712657200"},{"name":"Putchong Uthayopas","affiliation":["HPCNC, Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Putchong","lastName":"Uthayopas","id":"37269800600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0687-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0686-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0685-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5930093","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":525},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","genetic algorithms","Internet","software performance evaluation","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance improvement algorithm","cloud storage","genetic algorithm based placement","Internet","smart object placement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud storage","cloud computing","object placement","genetic algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5930093","abstract":"Cloud storage is a massive and public accessible storage available for use on internet.

This material offers greater thermal resistance than single-material electrodes due to the presence of multiple thermal boundary resistances (TBRs), reducing heat loss from the device and potentially lowering the programming current. Picosecond time-domain thermoreflectance interrogates the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity of three as-deposited and postannealed electrode materials: carbon, titanium nitride, and tungsten nitride. These data are used to extract the temperature-dependent, as-deposited, and postannealed TBR in two multilayer electrode stacks: carbon-titanium nitride and tungsten-tungsten nitride.

The RPO defects enhance greatly the low-frequency noise of the transistor. The noise level is further adaptable over two decades by the drain voltage.

The proposed structure has uniform seed grating but with the anti-symmetric-sample structure. It has been found that in such a structure, the wavelengths of the \u00b11st channels can be both blue-shifted more than 40 nm, but the wavelength of the 0th channel is not changed. When the +1st channel is used as the working channel, the wavelength spacing between the +1st channel and the 0th channel is increased by more than 40 nm. Such a phenomenon will be sure to increase the performance and working bandwidth of the REC-based components such as the REC-based distributed-feedback (DFB) laser/laser array.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gratings","Semiconductor laser arrays","Distributed feedback devices","Finite difference methods","Bragg gratings","Time domain analysis","Optical waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diffraction gratings","distributed feedback lasers","optical waveguides","spectral line shift"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anti-symmetric-sample grating structure","reconstruction-equivalent-chirp technology","uniform seed grating","blue shift","wavelength spacing","distributed feedback laser arrays","optical waveguides"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Planar waveguide","sampled grating","tilted grating","wideband operation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LPT.2011.2160623","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/5986811/05930332.pdf","startPage":"1337","endPage":"1339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5986811","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2011.2160623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Anti-Symmetric-Sample Grating Structure for Improving the Reconstruction-Equivalent-Chirp Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5930332","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Anti-Symmetric-Sample Grating Structure for Improving the Reconstruction-Equivalent-Chirp Technology","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5930332/","volume":"23","issue":"18","publicationDate":"Sept.15, 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5930332/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12206337","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.15,  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Anti-Symmetric-Sample Grating Structure for Improving the Reconstruction-Equivalent-Chirp Technology","sourcePdf":"lpt-shi-2160623-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060955S","chronDate":"Sept.15,  2011","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"5986811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5986811","articleId":"5930332","onlineDate":"27 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5930333,"authors":[{"name":"Kousuke Miyaji","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Systems, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5995181/5930333/5930333-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kousuke Miyaji (M'10) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 2003, 2005, and 2008, respectively.

In ICA the initial population individuals (countries) are in two types: imperialists and colonies that all together form some empires. Imperialistic competitions among these empires converge to a state in which there exists only one empire. In the proposed ICA for the UC problem, the scheduling variables are coded as integers; therefore, the minimum up/down-time constraints can be handled directly. A new method for initializing the countries is proposed. To verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, it is applied to systems with number of generating units in range of 10 up to 100 in one-day scheduling period.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2158010","startPage":"117","endPage":"124","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6133486/05930337.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2158010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6133486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Solution to the Unit Commitment Problem Using Imperialistic Competition Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuels","Cost function","Power generation","Time factors","Genetic algorithms","Spinning","Production"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","power generation dispatch","power generation scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unit commitment problem","imperialistic competition algorithm","evolutionary algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Generation scheduling","imperialistic competition algorithm","optimization methods","unit commitment problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5930337/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"A Solution to the Unit Commitment Problem Using Imperialistic Competition Algorithm","volume":"27","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5930337/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12479021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Solution to the Unit Commitment Problem Using Imperialistic Competition Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-vahidi-2158010-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122918S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6133486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"6133486","articleId":"5930337","onlineDate":"27 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":5930338,"authors":[{"name":"Supriya Aggarwal","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology, Bhopal, India"],"firstName":"Supriya","lastName":"Aggarwal","id":"38189801500"},{"name":"Pramod K.

Its pursuing involves the adoption of protective design concepts such as fault-tolerant or redundant approaches, aiming to minimize mission failure probabilities. Multi-phase motor drives are gaining a growing interest to this extent, because they permit a boost in torque and power density, allowing the design of very compact high efficiency drives with intrinsic fault-tolerant capabilities. This paper presents a five-phase permanent magnet brushless motor drive developed for an aircraft flap actuator application. The motor is designed to satisfy the load specifications with one or two phases open or with a phase short circuited, while a failure in the rotor position sensors is remedied through a sensorless strategy. Design studies aiming to predict the faulty mode performance in case of different remedial strategies are presented. Experimental tests on the drive prototype are included, which confirm its capability to satisfy the planned degraded modes of operation.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5930360","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Permanent magnet motors","Rotors","Stator windings","Brushless motors","Actuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace safety","aircraft","brushless machines","motor drives","permanent magnet motors","reliability","rotors","torque motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["five-phase permanent magnet brushless motor drive","aircraft flap actuator","reliability","aircraft safety-critical equipments","intrinsic fault-tolerant","redundant approach","mission failure probabilities","multiphase motor drives","torque boost","power density","phase short circuited","rotor position sensors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aerospace safety","aircraft","brushless motors","dependability","fault-tolerant system","finite elements analysis","multi-phase motor drives","permanent magnet motors","reliability"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6142654/05930360.pdf","startPage":"2073","endPage":"2081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142654","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2160514","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2160514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Reliability Permanent Magnet Brushless Motor Drive for Aircraft Application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5930360/","displayDocTitle":"High Reliability Permanent Magnet Brushless Motor Drive for Aircraft Application","isDynamicHtml":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12508900","htmlLink":"/document/5930360/","volume":"59","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Reliability Permanent Magnet Brushless Motor Drive for Aircraft Application","sourcePdf":"tie-tursini-2160514-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081523S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6142654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"6142654","articleId":"5930360","onlineDate":"27 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5930361,"authors":[{"name":"Damir Zarko","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, Drives and Automation, Zagreb, Croatia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6146784/5930361/5930361-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Damir \u017darko (M'06) was born in Zagreb, Croatia, in 1972.

These security-related properties, agreed upon a priori by the IP vendor and consumer and codified in a temporal logic, outline the boundaries of trusted operation, without necessarily specifying the exact IP functionality. A formal proof of these properties is then crafted by the vendor and presented to the consumer alongside the hardware IP. The consumer, in turn, can easily and automatically check the correctness of the proof and, thereby, validate compliance of the hardware IP with the agreed-upon properties. We implement the proposed framework using a synthesizable subset of Verilog and a series of pertinent definitions in the Coq theorem-proving language. Finally, we demonstrate the application of this framework on a simple IP acquisition scenario, including specification of security-related properties, Verilog code for two alter- native circuit implementations, as well as proofs of their security compliance.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2011.2160627","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/6126189/05930362.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"40","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6126189","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2011.2160627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proof-Carrying Hardware Intellectual Property: A Pathway to Trusted Module Acquisition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5930362","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Proof-Carrying Hardware Intellectual Property: A Pathway to Trusted Module Acquisition","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5930362/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12471610","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5930362/","volume":"7","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proof-Carrying Hardware Intellectual Property: A Pathway to Trusted Module Acquisition","sourcePdf":"tifs-makris-2160627-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145316S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6126189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"6126189","articleId":"5930362","onlineDate":"27 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5930363,"authors":[{"name":"Timo Horn","affiliation":["Ruhr-University Bochum, Institute of Electronic Circuits and Measurement, Bochum, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6095456/5930363/5930363-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Timo Horn received the Dipl.-Ing. degree in electrical engineering from the Ruhr-University Bochum, Bochum, Germany, in 2005, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with the Institute of Electronic Circuits and Measurement.","His research interests include injection-valve optimization and piezoactuator driving.

As the sensor selection optimality criteria, we propose the Kullback-Leibler and Chernoff distances between the distributions of the selected measurements under the two hypothesis. We formulate the maxmin robust sensor selection problem to cope with the uncertainties in distribution means. We prove that the sensor selection problem is NP hard, for both Kullback-Leibler and Chernoff criteria. To (sub)optimally solve the sensor selection problem, we propose an algorithm of affordable complexity. Extensive numerical simulations on moderate size problem instances (when the optimum by exhaustive search is feasible to compute) demonstrate the algorithm's near optimality in a very large portion of problem instances. For larger problems, extensive simulations demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms random searches, once an upper bound on computational time is set. We corroborate numerically the validity of the Kullback-Leibler and Chernoff sensor selection criteria, by showing that they lead to sensor selections nearly optimal both in the Neyman-Pearson and Bayes sense.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2160630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6017237","startPage":"4938","endPage":"4953","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6017237/05930376.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensor Selection for Event Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5930376/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5930376/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Sensor Selection for Event Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12227875","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensor Selection for Event Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-bajovic-2160630-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107841S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6017237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6017237","articleId":"5930376","onlineDate":"27 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5930377,"authors":[{"name":"Luc Knockaert","affiliation":["INTEC-IBCN-IBBT, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Luc","lastName":"Knockaert","id":"37282795900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"5930377","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":361},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"Sampling theorems for a class of scaled Bessel unitary transforms are presented.

In this paper, we introduce noncircular PCA (ncPCA), which extends the traditional PCA to the case where there can be both circular and noncircular Gaussian signals in the subspace. We study the properties of ncPCA, introduce an efficient algorithm for its computation, and demonstrate its application to model selection, i.e., the detection of both the signal subspace order and the number of circular and noncircular signals. We present numerical results to demonstrate the advantages of ncPCA over regular PCA when there are noncircular signals in the subspace. At the same time, we note that since a noncircular model has more degrees of freedom than a circular one, there are cases where a circular model might be preferred even though the underlying problem is noncircular. In particular, we show that a circular model is preferred when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low, number of samples is small, or the degree of noncircularity of the signals is low. Hence, ncPCA inherently provides guidance as to when to take noncircularity into account.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5930378/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5930378/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12227877","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Noncircular Principal Component Analysis and Its Application to Model Selection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noncircular Principal Component Analysis and Its Application to Model Selection","sourcePdf":"tsp-li-2160631-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091773S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6017237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6017237","articleId":"5930378","onlineDate":"27 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5930380,"authors":[{"name":"Charles Soussen","affiliation":["Centre de Recherche en Automatique de Nancy, CRAN, UMR 7039, CNRS, Nancy University, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6017237/5930380/5930380-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Charles Soussen was born in France in 1972.

We target this challenge with a new model-driven design process that effectively codesigns aspects of data, view, analytics, and tasks. We achieve this by using the workflow of the analysis task as a trajectory through data, interactive views, and analytical processes. The benefits for the analysis session go well beyond the pure selection of appropriate data sets and range from providing orientation or even guidance along a preferred analysis path to a potential overall speedup, allowing data to be fetched ahead of time. We illustrate the design process for a biomedical use case that aims at determining a treatment plan for cancer patients from the visual analysis of a large, heterogeneous clinical data pool. As an example for how to apply the comprehensive design approach, we present Stack'n'flip, a sample implementation which tightly integrates visualizations of the actual data with a map of available data sets, views, and tasks, thus capturing and communicating the analytical workflow through the required data sets.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6180049","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.108","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/6180049/05930386.pdf","startPage":"998","endPage":"1010","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-Driven Design for the Visual Analysis of Heterogeneous Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","displayDocTitle":"Model-Driven Design for the Visual Analysis of Heterogeneous Data","volume":"18","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5930386/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12656107","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2012","pubMedId":"21690642","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5930386/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-Driven Design for the Visual Analysis of Heterogeneous Data","sourcePdf":"ttg2012060998.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076679S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"6180049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6180049","articleId":"5930386","onlineDate":"27 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5930425,"authors":[{"name":"Qinqin Chai","affiliation":["Information Science and Engineering School, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Qinqin","lastName":"Chai","id":"37085861318"},{"name":"Chunhua Yang","affiliation":["Information Science and Engineering School, Central South University, Changsha, China","Electrical Engineering Department, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven-Heverlee, Belgium"],"firstName":"Chunhua","lastName":"Yang","id":"37404784500"},{"name":"Weihua Gui","affiliation":["Information Science and Engineering School, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Weihua","lastName":"Gui","id":"37273636200"},{"name":"Xiaoli Wang","affiliation":["Information Science and Engineering School, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoli","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089067354"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-988-17255-0-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7460-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5930425","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Feeds","Heat transfer","Force","Water heating","Topology","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chemical industry","evaporation","particle swarm optimisation","steam","vortices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy consumption optimization","high temperature steam","vortex motion based particle swarm optimization algorithm","penalty function","industry evaporation process","sodium aluminate liquor","VMPSO","steam consumption reduction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5930425","abstract":"Considering the mount of high temperature steam consumed in the evaporation process is large, which is much higher than designed value, an optimization model is established to minimize steam consumption per ton of evaporated water.

Unlike controllers for process industries, the motion controller must have specific properties, including limited size and high sampling frequency. To meet these requirements, we explore the implementation of a specified new MPC with swarm intelligence, called PSO-MPC, on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip. Standard PSO is modified so as to be applied in MPC. The FPGA chip addresses size constraints, and the PSO-MPC -on-chip strategy satisfies the need for high sampling frequency by exploiting the parallel features of both the PSO-MPC and the FPGA chip. A constrained control problem with 3 controlled variables and a prediction horizon of 10 is solved in 1 ms.

However, when a cooperative wireless communication system is designed to approach the maximum achievable spectral efficiency by taking the cooperation-induced multiplexing loss into account, it is not obvious whether or not the relay-aided system becomes superior to its direct-transmission based counterpart, especially, when advanced channel coding techniques are employed. Furthermore, the optimization of the transmit-interval durations required by the source and relay is an open issue, which has not been well understood in the context of half-duplex relaying schemes. Hence, we first find the optimum transmission duration, which is proportional to the adaptive channel-code rate of the source and relay in the context of Code-Rate-Optimized (CRO) TDMA-based DDF-aided half-duplex systems for the sake of maximizing the achievable network throughput. Then, we investigate the benefits of introducing cooperative mechanisms into wireless networks, which may be approached in the context of the proposed CRO cooperative system both from a pure capacity perspective and from the practical perspective of approaching the Discrete-input Continuous-output Memoryless Channel (DCMC) capacity with the aid of the proposed Irregular Distributed Differential (IrDD) coding aided scheme. In order to achieve a near-capacity performance at a low-complexity, an adaptive-window-duration based Multiple-Symbol Differential Sphere Detection (MSDSD) scheme is employed in the iterative detection aided receiver. Specifically, upon using the proposed near-capacity system design, the IrDD coding scheme devised becomes capable of performing within about 1.8 dB from the corresponding single-relay-aided DDF cooperative system's DCMC capacity.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.061511.100115","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5986797/05931040.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.061511.100115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5986797","startPage":"2185","endPage":"2195","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code-Rate-Optimized Differentially Modulated Near-Capacity Cooperation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5931040","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Code-Rate-Optimized Differentially Modulated Near-Capacity Cooperation","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5931040/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12213505","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5931040/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code-Rate-Optimized Differentially Modulated Near-Capacity Cooperation","sourcePdf":"2185-tc1108-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093374S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5986797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5986797","articleId":"5931040","onlineDate":"27 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5931042,"authors":[{"name":"Daejung Yoon","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5986797/5931042/5931042-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daejung Yoon received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea, in 2003 and 2005, respectively.

We develop a soft-decision-driven sequential algorithm geared to the pipelined turbo equalizer architecture operating on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols. One interesting feature of the pipelined turbo equalizer is that multiple soft-decisions become available at various processing stages. A tricky issue is that these multiple decisions from different pipeline stages have varying levels of reliability. This paper establishes an effective strategy for the channel estimator to track the target channel, while dealing with observation sets with different qualities. The resulting algorithm is basically a linear sequential estimation algorithm and, as such, is Kalman-based in nature. The main difference here, however, is that the proposed algorithm employs puncturing on observation samples to effectively deal with the inherent correlation among the multiple demapper/decoder module outputs that cannot easily be removed by the traditional innovations approach. The proposed algorithm continuously monitors the quality of the feedback decisions and incorporates it in the channel estimation process. The proposed channel estimation scheme shows clear performance advantages relative to existing channel estimation techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.061511.100238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5986797","startPage":"2141","endPage":"2151","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5986797/05931042.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.061511.100238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft-Decision-Driven Channel Estimation for Pipelined Turbo Receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Receivers","Technological innovation","Decoding","OFDM","Correlation","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft-decision-driven channel estimation","pipelined turbo receivers","multiple-input multiple-output wireless communication","MIMO wireless communication","pipelined turbo equalizer","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing symbols","OFDM symbols","linear sequential estimation algorithm","multiple demapper-decoder module"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO-OFDM","turbo equalization","sequential estimator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","displayDocTitle":"Soft-Decision-Driven Channel Estimation for Pipelined Turbo Receivers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5931042/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5931042/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12213506","publicationDate":"August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft-Decision-Driven Channel Estimation for Pipelined Turbo Receivers","sourcePdf":"2141-tc1108-yoon.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072541S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5986797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5986797","articleId":"5931042","onlineDate":"27 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5931044,"authors":[{"name":"Iaroslav V.

Cloud computing is to utilize the computing resources (service nodes) on the network to facilitate the execution of complicated tasks that require large-scale computation.

In particular, the capability of virtual machine(VM) migration brings multiple benefits for such as resources(CPU, memory, et al.) distribution, energy aware consolidation. However, the migration of virtual machines itself brings extra power consumption. For this reason, a better understanding of its effect on system power consumption is highly desirable. In this paper, we present a power consumption evaluation on the effects of live migration of VMs. Results show that the power overhead of migration is much less in the scenario of employing the strategy of consolidation than the regular deployment without using consolidation.

Commonly, the channel is composed of a few dominant coefficients and a large part of coefficients is approximately zero or under noise floor. To exploit the sparsity of multi-path channel (MPC), there are various methods have been proposed. They are, namely, greedy algorithms, iterative algorithms, and convex program. The former two algorithms are easy to be implemented but not stable, on the other hand, the last method is stable but difficult to be implemented as practical channel estimation problems because of computational complexity. In this paper, we introduce a novel channel estimation strategy using smooth L0 (SL0) algorithm which combines stable and low complexity. Computer simulations confirm the effectiveness of the introduced algorithm comparisons with the existing methods.

Most of existing works considered power control game under the interference temperature constrains which is a side condition. In this paper, we propose a power control algorithm using game theory. We define a new pricing function which can effectively control the network power consumption. This pricing function has a dynamic coefficient with interference temperature constrains and it is different from user to user. We also prove the existence and uniqueness of Nash Equilibrium (NE) for the above game. Simulation results show that the game with the proposed pricing function can improve the performance of the cognitive user. Furthermore, the new game model guarantees the fairness of cognitive users at a certain extent.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMC.2011.95","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5931122","startPage":"262","endPage":"265","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Third International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5931036/5931122/05931186.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Power Control Game via New Pricing with Dynamic Coefficient in Cognitive Radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5931186/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5931186/","displayDocTitle":"A Power Control Game via New Pricing with Dynamic Coefficient in Cognitive Radio","conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085383","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Power Control Game via New Pricing with Dynamic Coefficient in Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"4357a262.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118582S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5931036","isNumber":"5931122","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5931036","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5931122","articleId":"5931186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5931209,"authors":[{"name":"Xian Zhou","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications (BUPT), Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xian","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37406426600"},{"name":"Xue Chen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications (BUPT), Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xue","lastName":"Chen","id":"37291278600"},{"name":"Yangyang Fan","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications (BUPT), Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yangyang","lastName":"Fan","id":"37539941300"},{"name":"Bo Zhao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications (BUPT), Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37714781100"},{"name":"Sicong Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications (BUPT), Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Sicong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37716049500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-312-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5931209","dbTime":"38 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":226},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Digital signal processing","Algorithm design and analysis","Signal processing algorithms","Optical receivers","Optical filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical modulation","optical receivers","polarisation","quadrature phase shift keying","signal processing","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DSP algorithm design","POLMUX-NRZ-DQPSK digital coherent receiver","adoptive algorithm","DWDM transmission","SSMF","bit rate 112 Gbit/s","frequency 50 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["polarization multiplexing (POLMUX)","coherent receiver","digital signal processing (DSP)"]}],"abstract":"We provide a whole scheme design of the DSP part for POLMUX-NRZ-DQPSK coherent receiver, in which the adoptive algorithm of each module and preferred parameter value of algorithm are discussed.

We first formulate the relay selection as a nonlinear integral programming, and then propose two suboptimal methods, greedy scheme and hybrid scheme. Based on the sorted efficiency function, the greedy scheme selects the secondary relay nodes provided that the sum of the interference power does not exceed the interference power constraint (IPC) of the primary users. The hybrid scheme is proposed to overcome the performance degradation of the greedy scheme whose efficiency function is not the optimal ordering function. Numerical results indicate that the greedy scheme can sometimes, but not always, achieve the near-optimal SNR performance. The hybrid scheme always outperforms the greedy scheme and any best single scheme. Moreover, both the greedy scheme and hybrid scheme are of low complexity compared to the exhaustive scheme.","doi":"10.1109/CMC.2011.121","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Third International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5931036/5931122/05931233.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5931122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMC.2011.121","publicationTitle":"2011 Third International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","startPage":"307","endPage":"310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Multiple Relay Selection Schemes in Two-Hop Cognitive Relay Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5931233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Novel Multiple Relay Selection Schemes in Two-Hop Cognitive Relay Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5931233/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5931233/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085396","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2011","conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Multiple Relay Selection Schemes in Two-Hop Cognitive Relay Networks","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"4357a307.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057571S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5931036","isNumber":"5931122","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5931036","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5931122","articleId":"5931233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5931234,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37539333300"},{"name":"Yueming Cai","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yueming","lastName":"Cai","id":"37290653400"},{"name":"Junquan Hu","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Junquan","lastName":"Hu","id":"37596802800"},{"name":"Weiwei Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Weiwei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37290575300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-312-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5931234","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":260},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5931234","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Fading","Signal to noise ratio","Communication systems","Relays","Modulation","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","channel estimation","cooperative communication","Nakagami channels","numerical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","amplify-and-forward cooperative communication systems","channel estimation errors","Nakagami-m channels","AF cooperative communication","symbol error rate","moment-generating function","MGF","theoretical analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["channel estimation errors","average symbol error rate (SER)","average signal-noise-ratio (SNR) gap ratio"]}],"abstract":"We analyze the impact of channel estimation errors on amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperative communication systems over Nakagami-m fading channels.

The model of the minimizing transmission power allocation for each sub-carrier of source node and relay node is not a convex problem, so it is difficult to find the global optimal solution. A new scheme of Decode-and-Forward Power Allocation (OFDM-DF-PA) is proposed. First, the power is allocated between source and relay node after sub-carrier is allocated under a given transmission power for each sub-carrier. Second, the power of each sub-carrier is allocated individually in source and relay node. Then, three different schemes of Non-cooperative Power Allocation (NPA), Equal Power Allocation (EPA) and OFDM-DF Power Allocation are compared.

In this paper, we presented an efficient software implementation of the LDPC decoder using the Parallel Code Block Decoding mode for the WiMAX SDR base band system on IBM CELL Broadband Engine (BE). With a single Synergistic Processor Element (SPE) running at 3.2GHz, the implemented LDPC decoder can achieve a throughput up to 1.71 Mbps. With eight SPEs working in parallel, the decoder can obtain the throughput more than 13Mbps, which can meet the WiMAX system requirement at 5MHz bandwidth mode.","doi":"10.1109/CMC.2011.117","publicationTitle":"2011 Third International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Third International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5931036/5931122/05931249.pdf","startPage":"278","endPage":"281","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMC.2011.117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5931122","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5931249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Performance LDPC Decoder on CELL BE for WiMAX System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5931249/","displayDocTitle":"High Performance LDPC Decoder on CELL BE for WiMAX System","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5931249/","publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2011","conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085410","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Performance LDPC Decoder on CELL BE for WiMAX System","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"4357a278.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040797S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5931036","isNumber":"5931122","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5931036","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5931122","articleId":"5931249","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5931256,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Sheng Ni","affiliation":["Himax Media Solutions, Inc., Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Sheng","lastName":"Ni","id":"37429662000"},{"name":"Yao-Nan Lee","affiliation":["Himax Media Solutions, Inc., Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yao-Nan","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281118400"},{"name":"Shin-Shiuan Cheng","affiliation":["Himax Media Solutions, Inc., Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shin-Shiuan","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37712752300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-312-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5931256","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulation","equalisers","intersymbol interference","OFDM modulation","signal reconstruction","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative equalization","signal reconstruction","TDS-OFDM system","ZP-OFDM system","large delay-spread channel","intersymbol interference","time-domain signal component","channel impulse response","data symbol","time-domain synthesized signal","signal demodulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["delay spread","equalization","interference","TDSOFDM","overlap","add","ZP-OFDM"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose an iterative equalization algorithm for the TDS-OFDM/ZP-OFDM system to mitigate the inter-symbol interference (ISI) incurred by channels with large delay spread.

Simulation results are provided to verify the performance and computational efficiency of the proposed fast LS algorithm.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMC.2011.12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5931122","publicationTitle":"2011 Third International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Third International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5931036/5931122/05931267.pdf","endPage":"436","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multipath Channel Estimation Using Fast Least-Squares Algorithm","doi":"10.1109/CMC.2011.12","startPage":"433","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5931267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multipath Channel Estimation Using Fast Least-Squares Algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5931267/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12085428","publicationDate":"April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5931267/","conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multipath Channel Estimation Using Fast Least-Squares Algorithm","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"4357a433.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045039S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5931036","isNumber":"5931122","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5931036","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5931122","articleId":"5931267","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5931268,"authors":[{"name":"Lu Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, USA"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Lu","id":"37406124400"},{"name":"Hsiao-Chun Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, USA"],"firstName":"Hsiao-Chun","lastName":"Wu","id":"37292236100"},{"name":"Hong Jiang","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37398508400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-312-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5931268","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":140},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5931268","abstract":"In this paper, the frequency-domain pilot multiplexing techniques (FDPMTs) for the channel estimation in single-carrier frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE) systems are studied.

In cellular code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems, the power control subject to the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirement would mitigate the near-far effect and maintain a satisfactory overall system performance. In this paper, we introduce a new efficient optimization scheme for the power control in the CDMA uplinks. Our new analysis is derived for the realistic scenario consisting of multiple base stations and mobile users over the additive white Gaussian noise channel. Both intracell and intercell interference powers are considered here as the essential factors emerging in any cellular CDMA system. Besides, we also design a novel computationally-efficient power-control optimization scheme for the CDMA systems. This new scheme is simply based on the signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver and the locations of the base stations and mobile users. Finally, an example is presented to show the superiority of our proposed method for the uplink power-control optimization to another existing scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Approach for Optimal Power Control in the Uplink of Cellular CDMA Systems","publicationTitle":"2011 Third International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/CMC.2011.127","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Third International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5931036/5931122/05931276.pdf","startPage":"371","endPage":"374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMC.2011.127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5931122","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5931276","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5931276/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"A New Approach for Optimal Power Control in the Uplink of Cellular CDMA Systems","conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5931276/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085437","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Approach for Optimal Power Control in the Uplink of Cellular CDMA Systems","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"4357a371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069437S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5931036","isNumber":"5931122","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5931036","xplore-issue":"5931122","articleId":"5931276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5931277,"authors":[{"name":"Yinhui Yu","affiliation":["College of Communication Eng, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Yinhui","lastName":"Yu","id":"37715595300"},{"name":"Jing Li","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Li","id":"37279843700"},{"name":"Zhen Wang","affiliation":["Zhongxing Communications, ZTE Corporation, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37715210100"},{"name":"Shingang Wang","affiliation":["College of Communication Eng, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Shingang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37716302300"},{"name":"Huichuan Zhang","affiliation":["College of literary, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Huichuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37716652100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-312-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5931277","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kalman filters","Multiuser detection","Complexity theory","Fading","Signal to noise ratio","Approximation algorithms","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","Kalman filters","multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind multiuser detection","MC-CDMA","Schmidt-orthogonalization","subspace tracking Kalman filtering","multiple access interference","multicarrier code division multiple access system","projection approximation subspace tracking deflation","multipath fading","adaptive blind MUD algorithm","signal processing tools"]}],"abstract":"We consider multiuser detection (MUD) to combat multiple access interference (MAI), the detrimental impairment for a multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) system. The celebrated method of projection approximation subspace tracking deflation (PASTd) has been shown to achieve a good trade-off between performance and complexity. To further reduce the complexity and improve the performance especially in the presence of multi-path fading, we propose a new, adaptive, blind MUD algorithm by jointly exploiting the useful signal processing tools of Schmidt-orthogonalization and subspace Kalman-filtering.

We give an analytic open-loop Nash equilibria solution of the differential games model.","doi":"10.1109/CMC.2011.74","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Third International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5931036/5931122/05931281.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5931122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMC.2011.74","publicationTitle":"2011 Third International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","startPage":"518","endPage":"522","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Optimal Time-Dependent Throughput Analysis of Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5931281","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"The Optimal Time-Dependent Throughput Analysis of Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5931281/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5931281/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085442","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2011","conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Optimal Time-Dependent Throughput Analysis of Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"4357a518.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042738S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5931036","isNumber":"5931122","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5931036","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5931122","articleId":"5931281","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5931283,"authors":[{"name":"Xinsheng Yu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Submarine Geosciences and Prospecting Techniques, Ministry of Education, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Xinsheng","lastName":"Yu","id":"37716689600"},{"name":"Weiwei Jin","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Submarine Geosciences and Prospecting Techniques, Ministry of Education, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Weiwei","lastName":"Jin","id":"37710609300"},{"name":"Meihong Sui","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Submarine Geosciences and Prospecting Techniques, Ministry of Education, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Meihong","lastName":"Sui","id":"37717612400"},{"name":"Zhigong Lan","affiliation":["CNOOC Energy Technology and Services Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhigong","lastName":"Lan","id":"37719509500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-312-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5931283","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":964},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber communication","Encoding","Wireless communication","Adaptive optics","Attenuation","Optical attenuators","Optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forward error correction","optical modulation","Reed-Solomon codes","underwater optical wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater wireless optical communication","on-off key modulation","forward error correction coding","bit error rate","Reed-Solomon code","Bose Chaudhuri Hocquenghem scheme","error control coding","unreliable oceanography environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["underwater comunication","optical wirelesstsystem","forward error correction","bit error rate"]}],"abstract":"The advantage of optical wireless communication of high bandwidth and low cost makes it appeal for underwater communication applications.

In this context, we propose techniques for increasing the link utilization and enhancing the quality-of-experience (QoE) for end users while multiplexing video streams over a wired link. For increasing the link utilization, we present a generic multi-tiered bandwidth estimation and scheduling scheme that can guarantee lower bounds on loss for flows at lower tiers. This scheme can be used for supporting heterogeneous loss classes, differentiated losses for different layers of video streams, or per-flow guarantees using lower aggregate bandwidth than schemes proposed in the literature. For enhancing the end-user QoE, we present a scheme for minimizing correlated losses and improving the smoothness of video quality by minimizing the maximum loss suffered by any logical unit of a stream and also the variability in loss across the length of the stream. In simulations performed using MPEG-4 sources, our loss-minimization approach could lower the maximum loss by a factor of five and the loss variance by more than an order of magnitude. Our multi-tiered scheme could lower the estimated bandwidth and improve statistical multiplexing gains by 10-20% with three classes, 5-20% with two classes, and over 30% in the context of providing deterministic per-flow guarantees.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWQOS.2011.5931315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5931241","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Nineteenth IEEE International Workshop on Quality of Service","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Nineteenth IEEE International Workshop on Quality of Service","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888726/5931241/05931315.pdf","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-tiered, burstiness-aware bandwidth estimation and scheduling for VBR video flows","doi":"10.1109/IWQOS.2011.5931315","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5931315","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multi-tiered, burstiness-aware bandwidth estimation and scheduling for VBR video flows","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5931315/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12084028","publicationDate":"June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5931315/","conferenceDate":"6-7 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-tiered, burstiness-aware bandwidth estimation and scheduling for VBR video flows","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"a08kalle.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097632S","chronDate":"6-7 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888726","isNumber":"5931241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888726","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5931241","articleId":"5931315","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5931327,"authors":[{"name":"Chowdhury Sayeed Hyder","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Chowdhury Sayeed","lastName":"Hyder","id":"37649813500"},{"name":"Li Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37281269700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0103-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0104-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0102-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1548-615X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-615X"}],"articleNumber":"5931327","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Heuristic algorithms","Channel estimation","Mathematical model","Upper bound","Availability","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","distributed processing","learning (artificial intelligence)","telecommunication computing","telecommunication switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed learning","channel selection","cognitive radio network","sum regret","logarithmic regret","channel switching cost"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5931327","doi":"10.1109/IWQOS.2011.5931327","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Nineteenth IEEE International Workshop on Quality of Service","abstract":"In this paper, we address the channel selection problem with switching cost and propose a distributed learning approach that minimizes the sum regret while ensuring quick convergence to an optimal solution and logarithmic regret.

However, cloud systems are often shared by multiple tenants from different security domains, which makes them vulnerable to various malicious attacks. Moreover, cloud systems often host long-running applications such as massive data processing, which provides more opportunities for attackers to exploit the system vulnerability and perform strategic attacks. In this paper, we present AdapTest, a novel adaptive data-driven runtime service integrity attestation framework for multi-tenant cloud systems. AdapTest can significantly reduce attestation overhead and shorten detection delay by adaptively selecting attested nodes based on dynamically derived trust scores. Our scheme treats attested services as black-boxes and does not impose any special hardware or software requirements on the cloud system or ASPs. We have implemented AdapTest on top of the IBM System S stream processing system and tested it within a virtualized computing cluster. Our experimental results show that AdapTest can reduce attestation overhead by up to 60% and shorten the detection delay by up to 40% compared to previous approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5931339/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 June 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-7 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5931339/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12084052","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive data-driven service integrity attestation for multi-tenant cloud systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive data-driven service integrity attestation for multi-tenant cloud systems","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"a33du.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065813S","chronDate":"6-7 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888726","isNumber":"5931241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888726","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5931241","articleId":"5931339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5931340,"authors":[{"name":"Palden Lama","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Palden","lastName":"Lama","id":"37710569100"},{"name":"Xiaobo Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaobo","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37280488500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0103-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0104-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0102-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1548-615X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-615X"}],"articleNumber":"5931340","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":324},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Power demand","Adaptation model","Time factors","MIMO","Virtual machining","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","fuzzy neural nets","Internet","learning (artificial intelligence)","least squares approximations","MIMO systems","network servers","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy MIMO control","multiinput multioutput control","virtualized servers","Internet application","virtualized server cluster","PERFUME system","fuzzy modeling","fuzzy logic","MIMO control","artificial neural network","online learning","weighted recursive least-squares method","virtualized blade server","power consumption"]}],"abstract":"It is important but challenging to assure the performance of multi-tier Internet applications with the power consumption cap of virtualized server clusters mainly due to system complexity of shared infrastructure and dynamic and bursty nature of workloads. This paper presents PERFUME, a system that simultaneously guarantees power and performance targets with flexible tradeoffs while assuring control accuracy and system stability. Based on the proposed fuzzy MIMO control technique, it accurately controls both the throughput and percentile-based response time of multi-tier applications due to its novel fuzzy modeling that integrates strengths of fuzzy logic, MIMO control and artificial neural network. It is self-adaptive to highly dynamic and bursty workloads due to online learning of control model parameters using a computationally efficient weighted recursive least-squares method. We implement PERFUME in a testbed of virtualized blade servers hosting two multi-tier RUBiS applications. Experimental results demonstrate its control accuracy, system stability, flexibility in selecting tradeoffs between conflicting targets and robustness against highly dynamic variation and burstiness in workloads. It outperforms a representative utility based approach in providing guarantee of the system throughput, percentile-based response time and power budget in the face of highly dynamic and bursty workloads.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PERFUME: Power and performance guarantee with fuzzy MIMO control in virtualized servers","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Nineteenth IEEE International Workshop on Quality of Service","doi":"10.1109/IWQOS.2011.5931340","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Nineteenth IEEE International Workshop on Quality of Service","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888726/5931241/05931340.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWQOS.2011.5931340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5931241","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5931340","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5931340/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"PERFUME: Power and performance guarantee with fuzzy MIMO control in virtualized servers","conferenceDate":"6-7 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5931340/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12084053","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PERFUME: Power and performance guarantee with fuzzy MIMO control in virtualized servers","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"a34lama.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064951S","chronDate":"6-7 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888726","isNumber":"5931241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888726","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5931241","articleId":"5931340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5931361,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed Achemlal","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, France Telecom, Caen, France","Gryec Labroatory, Caen University, France","Orange Labs - France Telecom, Caen, France"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Achemlal","id":"37586545300"},{"name":"Said Gharout","affiliation":["Gryec Labroatory, Caen University, France"],"firstName":"Said","lastName":"Gharout","id":"37298670800"},{"name":"Chrystel Gaber","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, France Telecom, Caen, France","Gryec Labroatory, Caen University, France","Orange Labs - France Telecom, Caen, France"],"firstName":"Chrystel","lastName":"Gaber","id":"37586545800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0737-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0735-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0736-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5931361","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Software","Hardware","Cloud computing","Computer architecture","Privacy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trusted platform module","security","trusted computing group specification","cloud computing infrastructure"]}],"abstract":"This paper studies the possibility of using TCG (Trusted Computing Group) specifications to establish trust in Cloud Computing, especially between the provider of Cloud Computing infrastructures and his customers.

After careful study and analysis of this filter, we have concluded that its complexity lies in the data dependency and in the control module of elementary filters that compose it, but not in the type of these filters. In this paper, we propose two hardware implementations for the deblocking filter using the same strategy for memory management. The implementations differ on the utilized data width. The first one utilizes 32-bit while the second one utilizes 128-bit. The use of 128-bit data width is in order to ensure a high degree of parallelism and to avoid the use of transpose circuits and the intermediate buffers between the elementary modules in the filter. Simulation and synthesis results are then compared. The number of consumed LUTs remains almost the same compared with previous implementations and the number of clock cycles required to process a macroblock is reduced about 40% less than the best of the competing proposals.","doi":"10.1109/WOSSPA.2011.5931411","publicationTitle":"International Workshop on Systems, Signal Processing and their Applications, WOSSPA","displayPublicationTitle":"International Workshop on Systems, Signal Processing and their Applications, WOSSPA","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888820/5931402/05931411.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOSSPA.2011.5931411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5931402","startPage":"55","endPage":"58","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance comparison of two hardware implementations of the deblocking filter used in H.264 by changing the utilized data width","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5931411","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance comparison of two hardware implementations of the deblocking filter used in H.264 by changing the utilized data width","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5931411/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12085213","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5931411/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance comparison of two hardware implementations of the deblocking filter used in H.264 by changing the utilized data width","confLoc":"Tipaza, Algeria","sourcePdf":"Paper14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055259S","chronDate":"9-11 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888820","isNumber":"5931402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888820","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5931402","articleId":"5931411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5931418,"authors":[{"name":"Berdai Abdellah","affiliation":["Laboratoire de Radiocommunications et de Traitement du Signal (LRTS), Universit\u00e9 Laval Ste-Foy, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Berdai","lastName":"Abdellah","id":"37401646000"},{"name":"Jean-Yves Chouinard","affiliation":["Laboratoire de Radiocommunications et de Traitement du Signal (LRTS), Universit\u00e9 Laval Ste-Foy, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Jean-Yves","lastName":"Chouinard","id":"37274195300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0690-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0689-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0688-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5931418","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":296},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5931418","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity linear MMSE equalization, channel decoding and estimation for frequency selective fast fading channels","abstract":"The present work focuses on low complexity (LC) Linear Minimum Mean Square Error (LMMSE) schemes in conjunction with the existing paradigm of turbo equalization (TE).

The proposed GA model order reduction approach is compared to recently published work for method evaluation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5931421/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12085223","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5931421/","publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2011","conferenceDate":"9-11 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Frequency-based model order reduction via genetic algorithm approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-based model order reduction via genetic algorithm approach","confLoc":"Tipaza, Algeria","sourcePdf":"Paper23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103511S","chronDate":"9-11 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888820","isNumber":"5931402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888820","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5931402","articleId":"5931421","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5931422,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed-Rabie Oularbi","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement Signal et Communications, TELECOM Bretagne, Brest, France","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohamed-Rabie","lastName":"Oularbi","id":"38277264100"},{"name":"Saeed Gazor","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, Canada"],"firstName":"Saeed","lastName":"Gazor","id":"37273433700"},{"name":"Sebastien Houcke","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement Signal et Communications, TELECOM Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Sebastien","lastName":"Houcke","id":"37296570400"},{"name":"Abdeldjalii Aissa-El-Bey","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement Signal et Communications, TELECOM Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Abdeldjalii","lastName":"Aissa-El-Bey","id":"38266471700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0690-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0689-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0688-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5931422","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":146},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Indexes","Signal to noise ratio","FCC","Detectors","Time frequency analysis","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","computational complexity","maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM modulation","redundancy","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM system identification","pilot tone signature","generalized likelihood ratio test approach","pilot positions","redundancy","pilot symbols","system detection","channel estimation","noise variance estimation","computationally inexpensive"]}],"abstract":"This paper deals with the challenge of OFDM system identification.

In our method, we perform the clustering of the base-band symbols to recognize the constellation and evaluate the result by some validation method. For clustering, K-Means, one of the simplest and fastest clustering methods, and the Fuzzy Hyper Volume (FHV), a well-known, simple and fast index for validating fuzzy C-Means clustering method, are employed. The presented approach is fully unsupervised and performs its task despite the slowly-varying flat Rayleigh fading channel and without the knowledge of the parameters such as SNR, carrier phase and timing offset. Using this fast and accurate pair of method-index and introducing a novel idea for refining K-Means initial values that considerably increases accuracy and decreases the number of iterations required for K-Means clustering, guarantees high performance and low computational complexity of the aforementioned algorithm. It is shown via simulations that the algorithm performs correct classification when the SNR is over 10 dB for most practical linear modulation schemes under the presence of AWGN.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOSSPA.2011.5931439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5931402","startPage":"13","endPage":"16","displayPublicationTitle":"International Workshop on Systems, Signal Processing and their Applications, WOSSPA","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888820/5931402/05931439.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modulation classification of linearly modulated signals in a cognitive radio network using constellation shape","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5931439/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5931439/","displayDocTitle":"Modulation classification of linearly modulated signals in a cognitive radio network using constellation shape","conferenceDate":"9-11 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12085240","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modulation classification of linearly modulated signals in a cognitive radio network using constellation shape","confLoc":"Tipaza, Algeria","sourcePdf":"Paper4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049343S","chronDate":"9-11 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888820","isNumber":"5931402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888820","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5931402","articleId":"5931439","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5931441,"authors":[{"name":"Saeed Akhavan Astaneh","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Saeed Akhavan","lastName":"Astaneh","id":"37320565000"},{"name":"Saeed Gazor","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Saeed","lastName":"Gazor","id":"37273433700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0690-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0689-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0688-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5931441","dbTime":"32 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":379},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5931441","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Protocols","Fading","Relays","Cognitive radio","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","cognitive radio","decode and forward communication","probability","protocols","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relay assisted spectrum sensing","cognitive radio","cooperative spectrum sensing problem","relay user","RU","secondary user","SU","primary user","PU","amplify-and-forward scheme","compress-and-forward scheme","decode-and-forward scheme","Neyman-Pearson criterion","false alarm probability","Rayleigh fading channels"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WOSSPA.2011.5931441","publicationTitle":"International Workshop on Systems, Signal Processing and their Applications, WOSSPA","displayPublicationTitle":"International Workshop on Systems, Signal Processing and their Applications, WOSSPA","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888820/5931402/05931441.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOSSPA.2011.5931441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5931402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay assisted spectrum sensing in cognitive radio","abstract":"We consider a cooperative spectrum sensing problem in which a relay user (RU) assists a secondary user (SU) in order to detect the presence of a primary user (PU).

It's known by its robustness against frequency selective fading channels. In return, the major drawback of OFDM is the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the transmitted signal. This feature makes the OFDM signals very sensitive to non-linearities of the High Power Amplifier (HPA). Partial transmit sequence (PTS), is one of the most attractive method to reduce the PAPR in OFDM systems. It achieves considerable PAPR reduction without distortion, but it requires an exhaustive search over all the combinations of the given phase factors, which results in a computational complexity increases exponentially with the number of partitions. We propose in this paper, a sub-optimal PTS method based on Differential Evolution optimization method (DE), reducing efficiently the computational complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"International Workshop on Systems, Signal Processing and their Applications, WOSSPA","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888820/5931402/05931444.pdf","startPage":"175","endPage":"178","publicationTitle":"International Workshop on Systems, Signal Processing and their Applications, WOSSPA","doi":"10.1109/WOSSPA.2011.5931444","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOSSPA.2011.5931444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5931402","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5931444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential evolution algorithm for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Partial transmit sequences","Computational complexity","Time domain analysis","Minimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential evolution algorithm","PAPR reduction","OFDM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","sophisticated multicarrier modulation technique","frequency selective fading channel","high peak-to-average power ratio","high power amplifier","HPA","partial transmit sequence","PTS"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5931444/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Differential evolution algorithm for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5931444/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12085245","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2011","conferenceDate":"9-11 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential evolution algorithm for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Tipaza, Algeria","sourcePdf":"Paper44.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049198S","chronDate":"9-11 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888820","isNumber":"5931402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888820","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5931402","articleId":"5931444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5931448,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The later causes the ICI and ISI that destroy the relationship of the guard interval (GI) redundancy. Through exploiting the structural properties of MC-CDMA transmitted signal, the estimation can be resolved using least square fitting (LSF) and subspace approaches. Indeed, GI redundancy together with excess codes (EC) are used to restore the MC-CDMA properties. In addition, we propose the use of the previous algorithms in conjunction with a constant modulus algorithm (CMA) to improve the performance gain.

In such long reverberant channels that demand high computational complexity, turbo detectors based on minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion are an attractive solution to achieve a good balance between performance and complexity. Two different synchronous IDMA structures are studied and applied to signals acquired during sea trials in the North Sea; firstly, a channel estimation (CE) based IDMA with Rake reception, and secondly, an adaptive interference canceller (IC-IDMA). Both schemes include phase tracking, channel coding and are based on a chip-rate equalization and detection, which are fed in by a composite multiuser signal of the users' feedback soft information. Experimental results of three different channel ranges demonstrate that the direct adaptive receiver has better performance and additionally mitigates the errors associated with the CE based IDMA receiver while maintaining lower complexity.","doi":"10.1109/WOSSPA.2011.5931506","publicationTitle":"International Workshop on Systems, Signal Processing and their Applications, WOSSPA","displayPublicationTitle":"International Workshop on Systems, Signal Processing and their Applications, WOSSPA","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888820/5931402/05931506.pdf","startPage":"339","endPage":"342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOSSPA.2011.5931506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5931402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turbo multiuser detectors for IDMA-based underwater communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5931506","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5931506/","displayDocTitle":"Turbo multiuser detectors for IDMA-based underwater communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12085290","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5931506/","conferenceDate":"9-11 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbo multiuser detectors for IDMA-based underwater communications","confLoc":"Tipaza, Algeria","sourcePdf":"Paper85.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100983S","chronDate":"9-11 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888820","isNumber":"5931402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888820","xplore-issue":"5931402","articleId":"5931506","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5931513,"authors":[{"name":"Aawatif Hayar","affiliation":["GREENTIC, University Hassan II Casablanca Morocco, Casablanca, Morocco"],"firstName":"Aawatif","lastName":"Hayar","id":"37294011100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0690-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0689-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0688-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5931513","dbTime":"29 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":310},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Cognitive radio","Array signal processing","Resource management","Radio transmitters","Ultra wideband technology","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","energy consumption","environmental factors","interference suppression","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","UWB technology convergence","green network","green radio","UWB propagation","interference mitigation","interference control optimization","energy consumption optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UWB","Cognitive Radio","Green radio","Interference management","Power consumption","Beamforming"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Some issues on cognitive radio and UWB technology convergence for enabling green networks","doi":"10.1109/WOSSPA.2011.5931513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5931402","endPage":"370","publicationTitle":"International Workshop on Systems, Signal Processing and their Applications, WOSSPA","displayPublicationTitle":"International Workshop on Systems, Signal Processing and their Applications, WOSSPA","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888820/5931402/05931513.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOSSPA.2011.5931513","startPage":"365","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5931513","abstract":"In this paper we propose a new orientation and scenarios based on the convergence of UWB and cognitive radio technologies for enabling green radio.

In the last part of this work, we propose a new scenario based on the convergence between UWB technology and cognitive radio approach for the optimization of interference control and energy consumption.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5931513/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12085297","htmlLink":"/document/5931513/","conferenceDate":"9-11 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Some issues on cognitive radio and UWB technology convergence for enabling green networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some issues on cognitive radio and UWB technology convergence for enabling green networks","confLoc":"Tipaza, Algeria","sourcePdf":"Paper91.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06564S","chronDate":"9-11 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888820","isNumber":"5931402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888820","xplore-issue":"5931402","articleId":"5931513","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5931516,"authors":[{"name":"Asma Mejri","affiliation":["Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Asma","lastName":"Mejri","id":"37703865100"},{"name":"Laura Luzzi","affiliation":["Sup\u00e9lec, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Luzzi","id":"37542589400"},{"name":"Ghaya Rekaya-Ben Othman","affiliation":["Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Ghaya Rekaya-Ben","lastName":"Othman","id":"37294445000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0690-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0689-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0688-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5931516","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":116},"abstract":"\u201cNaive Lattice Decoding\u201d (NLD) and its low-complexity approximations such as lattice reduction-aided linear decoders represent an alternative to Maximum Likelihood lattice decoders for MIMO systems. Their diversity order has been investigated in recent works. These showed that the NLD achieves only the receive diversity and that MMSE-GDFE left preprocessing followed by NLD or its approximations achieves the maximum diversity. All the theoretical results have so far focused on the diversity order but this is not the only relevant parameter to achieve good performance and the coding gain also needs to be considered. In addition, up to now there has not been any numerical analysis of the actual performance of these techniques for the coded systems for moderate SNR. In this paper, we consider MIMO systems using high-dimensional perfect space-time codes. We show that by adding MMSE-GDFE preprocessing, the NLD has a loss of only 1.5 dB with respect to optimal decoding in the case of the Perfect Code 4 \u00d7 4. However, even with MMSE-GDFE preprocessing, the performance of lattice-reduction aided linear receivers is still very poor for high-dimensional lattices.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lattices","Signal to noise ratio","Approximation methods","MIMO","Encoding","Maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","maximum likelihood decoding","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["naive lattice decoding","low-complexity approximation","lattice reduction-aided linear decoder","maximum likelihood lattice decoder","MIMO system","diversity order","receive diversity","coding gain","high-dimensional perfect space-time code","MMSE-GDFE preprocessing","optimal decoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Diversity","Perfect Codes","Naive Lattice Decoder","MMSE-GDFE","LLL-reduction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WOSSPA.2011.5931516","publicationTitle":"International Workshop on Systems, Signal Processing and their Applications, WOSSPA","displayPublicationTitle":"International Workshop on Systems, Signal Processing and their Applications, WOSSPA","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888820/5931402/05931516.pdf","startPage":"379","endPage":"382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5931402","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOSSPA.2011.5931516","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the diversity of the Naive Lattice Decoder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5931516","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the diversity of the Naive Lattice Decoder","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5931516/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5931516/","accessionNumber":"12085300","conferenceDate":"9-11 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 May 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the diversity of the Naive Lattice Decoder","confLoc":"Tipaza, Algeria","sourcePdf":"Paper94.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041368S","chronDate":"9-11 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888820","isNumber":"5931402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888820","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5931402","articleId":"5931516","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5931517,"authors":[{"name":"Pu Wang","affiliation":["ECE Department, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Pu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538867500"},{"name":"Hongbin Li","affiliation":["ECE Department, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Hongbin","lastName":"Li","id":"37281093000"},{"name":"Braham Himed","affiliation":["AFRL/RYRT, Dayton, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Braham","lastName":"Himed","id":"37272986800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0690-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0689-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0688-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5931517","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":424},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Clutter","MIMO radar","Receiving antennas","Radar antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matched filters","MIMO radar","object detection","parameter estimation","radar antennas","radar clutter","radar detection","radar receivers","receiving antennas","statistical testing","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed moving target detection","nonhomogeneous power","radar clutter","distributed MIMO radar","multistatic transmit-receive configuration","nonhomogeneous clutter","low-rank subspace","generalized likelihood ratio test","GLRT","centralized detector","distributed receivers","parameter estimation","power consumption","bandwidth consumption","receive antenna","matched filter","multiple-input multiple-output radar","statistical testing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar","moving target detection","distributed detection","non-homogeneous clutter"]}],"abstract":"Previously, we studied moving target detection (MTD) using a distributed MIMO radar, where the multi-static transmit-receive configuration causes non-homogeneous clutter. By representing the non-homogeneous clutter in a low-rank subspace with different subspace coefficients for different transmit-receive pairs, a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), which is referred to as the MIMO-GLRT, was introduced. The MIMO-GLRT, however, is a centralized detector requiring the distributed receivers to send their local observations to a fusion center, which performs parameter estimation and computes a global test variable. In this paper, we consider distributed detection for the moving target problem. The goal is to reduce the communication overhead as well as power/bandwidth consumptions from the receivers to the fusion center. We consider two distributed implementations of the MIMO-GLRT, with or without local data aggregation. Specifically, the one that performs local aggregation computes a single local test statistic at each receive antenna, by using the outputs of all matched filters (each matched to a waveform unique to one transmit antenna); meanwhile, the one that does not perform local aggregation computes multiple local test statistics, one for each matched filter output. In both cases, the local unquantized test statistics from all receive antennas are forwarded to the fusion center and non-coherently combined to form a final test variable. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the performance loss with respect to the centralized MIMO-GLRT and compare with another distributed MIMO moving target detector based on a homogeneous assumption.","doi":"10.1109/WOSSPA.2011.5931517","publicationTitle":"International Workshop on Systems, Signal Processing and their Applications, WOSSPA","displayPublicationTitle":"International Workshop on Systems, Signal Processing and their Applications, WOSSPA","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888820/5931402/05931517.pdf","startPage":"383","endPage":"387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOSSPA.2011.5931517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5931402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed detection of moving target using MIMO radar in clutter with non-homogeneous power","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5931517","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5931517/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed detection of moving target using MIMO radar in clutter with non-homogeneous power","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12085301","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5931517/","conferenceDate":"9-11 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed detection of moving target using MIMO radar in clutter with non-homogeneous power","confLoc":"Tipaza, Algeria","sourcePdf":"Paper95.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053076S","chronDate":"9-11 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888820","isNumber":"5931402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888820","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5931402","articleId":"5931517","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5931521,"authors":[{"name":"Amel Hebboul","affiliation":["Computer Department, Constantine University, Constantine, Algeria"],"firstName":"Amel","lastName":"Hebboul","id":"37703878300"},{"name":"Meriem Hacini","affiliation":["Electronic Department, Automatic and Robotic Laboratory, Constantine University, Constantine, Algeria"],"firstName":"Meriem","lastName":"Hacini","id":"37590686600"},{"name":"Fella Hachouf","affiliation":["Electronic Department, Automatic and Robotic Laboratory, Constantine University, Constantine, Algeria"],"firstName":"Fella","lastName":"Hachouf","id":"37590686900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0690-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0689-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0688-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5931521","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":201},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Noise","Topology","Artificial neural networks","Network topology","Algorithm design and analysis","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","pattern classification","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsupervised classification","parallel learning technique","data clustering","self-organizing incremental parallel neural network","two-layer neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Incremental learning","Parallel learning","Neural Network","Unsupervised Classification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5931521","abstract":"This paper presents a novel unsupervised and parallel learning technique for data clustering that are polluted by noise using neural network approaches.

In particular, we are interested in the question of how much throughput needs to be sacrificed for achieving a certain level of security. We consider random networks where the legitimate nodes and the eavesdroppers are distributed according to independent two-dimensional Poisson point processes. The transmission capacity framework is used to characterize the area spectral efficiency of secure transmissions with constraints on both the quality of service (QoS) and the level of security. This framework illustrates the dependence of the network throughput on key system parameters, such as the densities of legitimate nodes and eavesdroppers, as well as the QoS and security constraints. One important finding is that the throughput cost of achieving a moderate level of security is quite low, while throughput must be significantly sacrificed to realize a highly secure network. We also study the use of a secrecy guard zone, which is shown to give a significant improvement on the throughput of networks with high security requirements.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.061511.102257","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5985568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.061511.102257","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5985568/05934342.pdf","startPage":"2764","endPage":"2775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Throughput Cost of Physical Layer Security in Decentralized Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"On the Throughput Cost of Physical Layer Security in Decentralized Wireless Networks","volume":"10","issue":"8","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5934342/","publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12205955","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934342/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Throughput Cost of Physical Layer Security in Decentralized Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"2764-tw1108-zhou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148551S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5985568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"176","xplore-issue":"5985568","articleId":"5934342","onlineDate":"27 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5934343,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Chung Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5985568/5934343/5934343-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Li-Chung Kuo received his B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan in 1999.

To address these requirements, a new medium access control protocol named UMIMO-MAC is proposed. UMIMO-MAC is designed to i) adaptively leverage the tradeoff between multiplexing and diversity gain according to channel conditions and application requirements, ii) select suitable transmit power to reduce energy consumption, and iii) efficiently exploit the UW channel, minimizing the impact of the long propagation delay on the channel utilization efficiency. To achieve the objectives above, UMIMO-MAC is based on a two-way handshake protocol. Multiple access by simultaneous and co-located transmissions is achieved by using different pseudo-orthogonal spreading codes. An algorithm is proposed that, in a cross-layer fashion, jointly selects optimal transmit power and transmission mode through the cooperation of transmitter and receiver to achieve the desired level of reliability and data rate according to application needs and channel condition. Extensive simulation results show that UMIMO-MAC increases network throughput, decreases channel access delay, and decrease energy consumption compared with existing MAC protocols for UW-ASNs.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.061511.100233","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5985568/05934343.pdf","startPage":"2523","endPage":"2533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.061511.100233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5985568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Medium Access Control Strategies for MIMO Underwater Acoustic Networking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934343","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934343/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Medium Access Control Strategies for MIMO Underwater Acoustic Networking","volume":"10","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12205956","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5934343/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Medium Access Control Strategies for MIMO Underwater Acoustic Networking","sourcePdf":"2523-tw1108-kuo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113849S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5985568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5985568","articleId":"5934343","onlineDate":"27 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5934344,"authors":[{"name":"Zhuwei Wang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5985568/5934344/5934344-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhuwei Wang received the B.E. degree from the School of Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China, in July 2005.

In this paper, a novel MIMO transmission scheme, called spatial modulation with trellis coding (SM-TC), is proposed. Similar to the conventional trellis coded modulation (TCM), in this scheme, a trellis encoder and an SM mapper are jointly designed to take advantage of the benefits of both. A soft decision Viterbi decoder, which is fed with the soft information supplied by the optimal SM decoder, is used at the receiver. A pairwise error probability (PEP) upper bound is derived for the SM-TC scheme in uncorrelated quasi-static Rayleigh fading channels. From the PEP upper bound, code design criteria are given and then used to obtain new 4-, 8- and 16-state SM-TC schemes using quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) and 8-ary phase-shift keying (8-PSK) modulations for 2,3 and 4 bits/s/Hz spectral efficiencies. It is shown via computer simulations and also supported by a theoretical error performance analysis that the proposed SM-TC schemes achieve significantly better error performance than the classical space-time trellis codes and coded V-BLAST systems at the same spectral efficiency, yet with reduced decoding complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.061511.101745","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5985568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.061511.101745","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5985568/05934345.pdf","startPage":"2670","endPage":"2680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Trellis Code Design for Spatial Modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"New Trellis Code Design for Spatial Modulation","volume":"10","issue":"8","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5934345/","publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12205957","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934345/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Trellis Code Design for Spatial Modulation","sourcePdf":"2670-tw1108-basar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105343S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5985568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"5985568","articleId":"5934345","onlineDate":"27 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-14"},{"_id":5934346,"authors":[{"name":"Khairi Ashour Hamdi","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5985568/5934346/5934346-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":[" (M'99-SM'02) received the B.

Time variations within the transmission time of one OFDM block destroy the orthogonality among the subcarriers giving rise to interchannel interference (ICI) which degrades the performance of OFDM over fast fading channels. Error rate analysis of OFDM in the presence of ICI is not trivial due to the cross-correlation between the ICI and the useful signal components. Based on accurate statistical models of the ICI, this paper presents a new accurate non-direct analytical method which simplifies greatly performance evaluation of OFDM in the presence of ICI. This results in new unified expressions for bit and symbol error rates of multilevel quadrature amplitude modulation (MQAM) and M-ary phase shift keying (MPSK) based OFDM communication systems over fast Rayleigh multipath fading channels. These results are further extended to include error rate analysis of OFDM with transmit diversity techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.061511.101779","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5985568/05934346.pdf","startPage":"2692","endPage":"2702","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.061511.101779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5985568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unified Error-Rate Analysis of OFDM over Time-Varying Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934346","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934346/","displayDocTitle":"Unified Error-Rate Analysis of OFDM over Time-Varying Channels","volume":"10","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12178606","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5934346/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unified Error-Rate Analysis of OFDM over Time-Varying Channels","sourcePdf":"2692-tw1108-hamdi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072027S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5985568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5985568","articleId":"5934346","onlineDate":"27 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5934347,"authors":[{"name":"Changick Song","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Changick","lastName":"Song","id":"37406218100"},{"name":"Inkyu Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Inkyu","lastName":"Lee","id":"37279664500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5934347","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":823},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","OFDM","Array signal processing","Antennas","Fading","MIMO","Frequency diversity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","antenna arrays","array signal processing","channel coding","diversity reception","error statistics","fading channels","interleaved codes","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity analysis","coded beamforming","MIMO-OFDM amplify-and-forward relaying system","diversity performance","coded beamforming scheme","AF multiple antenna relay system","frequency selective channel","multipath diversity","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","bit interleaved coded modulation","pairwise error probability","correlated fading assumption","code construction criterion","code memory","subcarrier mapping"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","relay","diversity","subcarrier pairing"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we investigate the diversity performance of coded beamforming schemes in AF multiple antenna relay systems for frequency selective channels.

The pairwise error probability is analyzed based on the correlated fading assumption, and the theoretical evaluation of the maximum achievable diversity order is presented. From the analysis, a proper code construction criterion is provided which achieves the full diversity with the minimum code memory.

The optimum modulation index and the minimum required optical signal-to-noise ratio are evaluated for optical network units (ONUs) at different distances from the optical line termination (OLT). The degradation due to first-order polarization mode dispersion (PMD), fiber nonlinearity, phase noise due to the Kerr effect, and the phase noise due to finite laser linewidth is assessed as well. It is shown that the use of dispersion compensation in LR-PONs employing the MZ-EOM is a powerful solution to mitigate the dispersion-induced power fading. It is also shown that, contrarily to the L-EOM case, the same optimum voltage level at the EOM input is required by DC LR-PONs employing the MZ modulator, independently of the ONUs distances. In addition, an optical signal-to-noise ratio penalty not exceeding 0.5 dB due to first order PMD effect is obtained for a PMD parameter below 0.5 ps\u00b7km\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1/2</sup>\n and for a fiber nonlinearity corresponding to a nonlinear phase shift not exceeding 11 mrad. This conclusion holds for pre (at the OLT) and post (at the remote node) compensation schemes. The performance degradation induced by the laser phase noise is also negligible in DC LR-PONs for typical laser linewidths due to the reduced phase-to-intensity noise conversion.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5959262/05934350.pdf","startPage":"2467","endPage":"2474","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2011.2160616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2011.2160616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5959262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934350","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distribution of Double-Sideband OFDM-UWB Radio Signals in Dispersion Compensated Long-Reach PONs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical noise","Signal to noise ratio","Dispersion","Modulation","Degradation","Optical network units","Passive optical networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electro-optical modulation","OFDM modulation","optical Kerr effect","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["double-sideband OFDM-UWB radio signal","PON","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","ultra wideband radio signal distribution","passive optical network","electro-optic modulator","optical network unit","optical line termination","polarization mode dispersion","fiber nonlinearity","phase noise","finite laser linewidth","MZ modulator","Kerr effect"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dispersion compensation","long-reach passive optical networks","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","ultra wideband"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934350/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.15,  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Distribution of Double-Sideband OFDM-UWB Radio Signals in Dispersion Compensated Long-Reach PONs","volume":"29","issue":"16","htmlLink":"/document/5934350/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug.15, 2011","accessionNumber":"12175460","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distribution of Double-Sideband OFDM-UWB Radio Signals in Dispersion Compensated Long-Reach PONs","sourcePdf":"jlt-alves-2160616-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068218S","chronDate":"Aug.15,  2011","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5959262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5959262","articleId":"5934350","onlineDate":"27 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5934351,"authors":[{"name":"Yuhei Ishizaka","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Yuhei Ishizaka was born in Hokkaido, Japan, on May 4, 1985.

Fiber-Wireless (FiWi) access networks must be able to transport video traffic in an efficient way due to the fact that video will account for the largest part of global consumer traffic. To reduce the energy consumption of FiWi networks and guarantee the performance of video applications, issues related to the energy-efficient Quality-of-Service (QoS) support for video delivery in IEEE 803.3az Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE)-based FiWi access networks are addressed in this paper. We extend EEE packet coalescing by considering QoS priorities and the shared nature of FiWi networks and improve the QoS support for video delivery by proposing a green QoS differentiated routing strategy. In addition, to better evaluate the performance of our scheme in a real-world setting, we carry out traffic measurements for the research on EEE-based networks and use them in our simulations. Our results show that the proposed scheme can effectively guarantee video delivery and reduce the energy consumption of EEE-based FiWi access networks.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2011.2160713","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5986810/05934352.pdf","startPage":"2670","endPage":"2676","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2011.2160713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5986810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Tradeoff Between Energy Saving and QoS Support for Video Delivery in EEE-Based FiWi Networks Using Real-World Traffic Traces","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934352","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.15,  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934352/","displayDocTitle":"On the Tradeoff Between Energy Saving and QoS Support for Video Delivery in EEE-Based FiWi Networks Using Real-World Traffic Traces","volume":"29","issue":"18","publicationDate":"Sept.15, 2011","accessionNumber":"12206295","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5934352/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Tradeoff Between Energy Saving and QoS Support for Video Delivery in EEE-Based FiWi Networks Using Real-World Traffic Traces","sourcePdf":"jlt-liu-2160713-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082119S","chronDate":"Sept.15,  2011","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5986810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5986810","articleId":"5934352","onlineDate":"27 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5934357,"authors":[{"name":"Dornoosh Zonoobi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/5983457/5934357/5934357-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dornoosh Zonoobi received the B.Sc. degree (with honors) from Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran, in 2005, and the M.Eng. degree in computer engineering from the National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2008, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","Her research interests include compressive signal/image processing, medical image analysis, and image coding."]},"firstName":"Dornoosh","lastName":"Zonoobi","id":"37591276900"},{"name":"Ashraf A.

One advantage of the approach is the reduction of the instantaneous bandwidth and sampling rate requirements of the radar system. To reconstruct the spectrum of a wideband signal, the amplitude and phase discontinuity between contiguous pulses should be removed. Otherwise, the discontinuity will defocus the range profile and degrade the range resolution.

nodes operating with and without batteries, and implantable medical devices powered by batteries and wireless charging) becomes more stringent, the data converter design evolves toward mircrowatt and submircrowatt power consumption. In this brief, a 400-nW successive approximation analog-to-digital converter (SAR ADC) is presented. A trilevel switching scheme with common-mode reset, redundant algorithm, and a time-domain comparator is proposed and implemented to achieve ultralow power consumption. The redundant algorithm mitigates the offset error caused by the level mismatch of the trilevel switching scheme, whereas the trilevel switching scheme simplifies the switching logic of the redundant algorithm. Fabricated in a 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS process, the proposed SAR ADC achieves a signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio of 50 dB, which is equivalent to an 8-bit effective number of bits, at an 80-kS/s conversion rate. The figure of merit is 19.5 fJ/conversion step.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5956085","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2011.2158255","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/5956085/05934370.pdf","startPage":"407","endPage":"411","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2011.2158255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 400-nW 19.5-fJ/Conversion-Step 8-ENOB 80-kS/s SAR ADC in 0.18- - CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"A 400-nW 19.5-fJ/Conversion-Step 8-ENOB 80-kS/s SAR ADC in 0.18- <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu\\hbox{m}$</tex></formula> CMOS","volume":"58","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5934370/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12158026","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934370/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 400-nW 19.5-fJ/Conversion-Step 8-ENOB 80-kS/s SAR ADC in 0.18- <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu\\hbox{m}$</tex></formula> CMOS","sourcePdf":"tcsii-cheong-2158255-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104729S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"5956085","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5956085","articleId":"5934370","onlineDate":"27 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5934373,"authors":[{"name":"Taehwan Oh","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Taehwan","lastName":"Oh","id":"37069274300"},{"name":"Nima Maghari","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Nima","lastName":"Maghari","id":"37269787500"},{"name":"David Gubbins","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Gubbins","id":"37426958100"},{"name":"Un-Ku Moon","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Un-Ku","lastName":"Moon","id":"37276672400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"5934373","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":685},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jitter","Signal to noise ratio","Clocks","Mathematical model","Sampling methods","Analytical models","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","jitter","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["jitter immunity","WRS","window residue sampling","signal-to-noise ratio","integration sampling methods","Nyquist input frequency","ADC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog\u2013digital conversion (ADC)","charge sampling","impulse sampler","integration sampler","jitter","sampling methods"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934373","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2011.2158273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2011.2158273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5956085","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/5956085/05934373.pdf","startPage":"417","endPage":"421","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Residue Integration Sampling With Improved Jitter Immunity","abstract":"The improved jitter immunity of window residue sampling (WRS) is analyzed in this brief.

However, the research communities lack a theoretical modeling and analysis for multimedia system performance over cognitive radio networks. In this paper, a novel Markov-Chain based model of centralized cognitive radio network (CCRN) consisting of APs and user equipments (UEs) equipped with several antennas (one antenna for channel sensing, the others for data communication) is proposed. In the proposed model, AP will scan the idle primary channels (PCs) that are not used by primary users (PUs), and then transmit data through selected idle channels. Each selected channel in CCRN will be divided into many sub-time slots and some of them are used as the signalling control and the other slots are used only for data transmissions. In addition, three types of communications are considered and an appropriate number of time slots are pre-assigned to ensure QoS of multiple types of multimedia traffic. We used a multi-dimension Markov chain to model time slot allocation and proposed a general channel allocation model for multimedia traffic over CCRN. We validated our model through both theoretical analysis and simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934385/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2011","volume":"5","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"12502675","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5934385/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modeling Channel Allocation for Multimedia Transmission Over Infrastructure Based Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling Channel Allocation for Multimedia Transmission Over Infrastructure Based Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"jsyst-wang-2159640-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074673S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"5995186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5995186","articleId":"5934385","onlineDate":"27 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5934387,"authors":[{"name":"Bahram Alidaee","affiliation":["School of Business Administration, University of Mississippi, University, MS, USA"],"firstName":"Bahram","lastName":"Alidaee","id":"37323976000"},{"name":"Haibo Wang","affiliation":["Sanchez School of Business, Texas A&M International University, Laredo, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Haibo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37656354400"},{"name":"Frank Landram","affiliation":["College of Business Administration, West Texas A&M University, Canyon, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Landram","id":"37714307300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-5955"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3783"}],"articleNumber":"5934387","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1033},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"}],"abstract":"Multiresource generalized assignment problem (MRGAP) has enormous applications in solving real problems of industries. In recent years, several generalizations of MRGAP have been proposed to tackle very difficult problems. An important generalization is called flexible demand assignment (FDA) problem. In this paper, a generalization of FDA is proposed that has many applications. Two features of our formulation are inclusion of: 1) acceptance of orders from a large set of available orders and 2) consideration of setup time between operations of two consecutive of tasks. We show an interesting application of generalized FDA is unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assignment problem. For the UAV assignment problem, we show our formulation considerably reduces the size of the problem compared to some recent results. To test effectiveness of the proposed model, computational experiment with CPLEX for the UAV assignment problem is presented.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Routing","Computational modeling","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Production planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft control","mobile robots","remotely operated vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible demand assignment problem","unmanned aerial vehicles","multiresource generalized assignment problem","MRGAP","UAV assignment problem","CPLEX"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Flexible demand assignment (FDA) problem","unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934387","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2011.2159709","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/8856/6025294/05934387.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2011.2159709","startPage":"865","endPage":"868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6025294","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Flexible Demand Assignment Problems: Case of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Flexible Demand Assignment Problems: Case of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934387/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2011","volume":"8","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5934387/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12270697","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Flexible Demand Assignment Problems: Case of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tase-wang-2159709-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065946S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"6025294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6025294","articleId":"5934387","onlineDate":"27 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5934394,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Azarderakhsh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Western Ontario, London, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6218240/5934394/5934394-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Reza Azarderakhsh (S'08) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from the Civil Aviation Technology College, Tehran, Iran, in 2002, and the M.Sc. degree in computer engineering (computer architecture) from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2005.

As a result, errors in the medium are dependent on each other and also on the data written. We consider a simple 1-D combinatorial model of this medium. In our model, we assume a setting where binary data is sequentially written on the medium and a bit can erroneously change to the immediately preceding value. We derive several properties of codes that correct this type of errors, focusing on bounds on their cardinality. We also define a probabilistic finite-state channel model of the storage medium, and derive lower and upper estimates of its capacity. A lower bound is derived by evaluating the symmetric capacity of the channel, i.e., the maximum transmission rate under the assumption of the uniform input distribution of the channel. An upper bound is found by showing that the original channel is a stochastic degradation of another, related channel model whose capacity we can compute explicitly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934413/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","volume":"57","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12356968","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Coding for High-Density Recording on a 1-D Granular Magnetic Medium","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding for High-Density Recording on a 1-D Granular Magnetic Medium","sourcePdf":"tit-mazumdar-2158514-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059789S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","isNumber":"6071748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"23","articleId":"5934413","onlineDate":"27 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5934416,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Zhou","affiliation":["Key Lab of Broadband Wireless Communication and Sensor Network Technology, Ministry of Education, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/6018340/5934416/5934416-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liang Zhou (M'09) received the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from Ecole Normale Suprieure (E.N.S.), Cachan, France, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in March 2009.","From 2009 to 2010, he was a postdoctoral researcher in ENSTA-ParisTech, Paris, France.

However, in practice the control channels are always constrained and nodes can only exchange limited information with their neighbors. In this paper, we investigate how imperfect neighbor information affects the multimedia scheduling. First, we formulate the optimal multimedia scheduling problem with the constraints on network information. Specifically, a constrained factor is introduced to capture the profile of control channels. Then, we consider two cases of the constrained factor distribution: 1) the class with finite mean and variance, and 2) a general class that does not employ any parametric representation. In each case, we investigate the relationship between the control gain and scheduling performance based on available network and multimedia information. We show that the control gain can be chosen properly such that the optimal distributed multimedia scheduling can be achieved with an exponential convergence rate. In addition, an explicit equation for asymptotic convergence rate is derived for each case. Finally, we use computer simulations to verify the analytical results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934416/","volume":"13","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5934416/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12228559","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On Distributed Multimedia Scheduling With Constrained Control Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Distributed Multimedia Scheduling With Constrained Control Channels","sourcePdf":"tmm-chen-2160716-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088225S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"6018340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6018340","articleId":"5934416","onlineDate":"27 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5934421,"authors":[{"name":"Bukhari Che Ujang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5970288/5934421/5934421-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bukhari Che Ujang (S'11) received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from Multimedia University, Cyberjaya, Malaysia, in 2006.

To circumvent the stringent standard analyticity conditions which are prohibitive to the development of nonlinear adaptive quaternion-valued estimation models, we use the fact that stochastic gradient learning algorithms require only local analyticity at the operating point in the estimation space. It is shown that the quaternion-valued exponential function is locally analytic, and, since local analyticity extends to polynomials, products, and ratios, we show that a class of transcendental nonlinear functions can serve as activation functions in nonlinear and neural adaptive models. This provides a unifying framework for the derivation of gradient-based learning algorithms in the quaternion domain, and the derived algorithms are shown to have the same generic form as their real- and complex-valued counterparts. To make such models second-order optimal for the generality of quaternion signals (both circular and noncircular), we use recent developments in augmented quaternion statistics to introduce widely linear versions of the proposed nonlinear adaptive quaternion valued filters. This allows full exploitation of second-order information in the data, contained both in the covariance and pseudocovariances to cater rigorously for second-order noncircularity (improperness), and the corresponding power mismatch in the signal components. Simulations over a range of circular and noncircular synthetic processes and a real world 3-D noncircular wind signal support the approach.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2011.2157358","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5970288/05934421.pdf","startPage":"1193","endPage":"1206","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2011.2157358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5970288","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quaternion-Valued Nonlinear Adaptive Filtering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934421/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Quaternion-Valued Nonlinear Adaptive Filtering","volume":"22","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12205118","pubMedId":"21712159","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5934421/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quaternion-Valued Nonlinear Adaptive Filtering","sourcePdf":"tnn-cheujang-2157358-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089939S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5970288","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"5970288","articleId":"5934421","onlineDate":"27 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5934423,"authors":[{"name":"Haifeng Fan","affiliation":["Texas Instruments Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6088512/5934423/5934423-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haifeng Fan (S\u201909) received the B.S. degree from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2001, the M.S. degree from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree from The Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, in 2011, all in electrical engineering.","He is currently at Texas Instruments Inc., Tempe, AZ.

The ISOP modular structure enables the use of low-voltage MOSFETs, featuring low on-state resistance and resulted conduction losses, to address medium-voltage input. A phase-shift dual-half-bridge (DHB) converter is employed to achieve high-frequency galvanic isolation, bidirectional power flow, and zero voltage switching (ZVS) of all switching devices, which leads to low switching losses even with high-frequency operation. Furthermore, an adaptive inductor is proposed as the main energy transfer element of a phase-shift DHB converter so that the circulating energy can be optimized to maintain ZVS at light load and minimize the conduction losses at heavy load as well. As a result, high efficiency over wide load range and high power density can be achieved. In addition, current stress of switching devices can be reduced. A planar transformer adopting printed-circuit-board windings arranged in an interleaved structure is designed to obtain low core and winding loss, solid isolation, and identical parameters in multiple modules. Moreover, the modular structure along with a distributed control provides plug-and-play capability and possible high-level fault tolerance. The experimental results on 1 kW DHB converter modules switching at 50 kHz are presented to validate the theoretical analysis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Frequency Transformer Isolated Bidirectional DC\u2013DC Converter Modules With High Efficiency Over Wide Load Range for 20 kVA Solid-State Transformer","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2160652","startPage":"3599","endPage":"3608","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2160652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6088512","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6088512/05934423.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934423","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934423/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"High-Frequency Transformer Isolated Bidirectional DC\u2013DC Converter Modules With High Efficiency Over Wide Load Range for 20 kVA Solid-State Transformer","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"26","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5934423/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12403255","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Frequency Transformer Isolated Bidirectional DC\u2013DC Converter Modules With High Efficiency Over Wide Load Range for 20 kVA Solid-State Transformer","sourcePdf":"tpel-fan-2160652-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076225S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6088512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"250","xplore-issue":"6088512","articleId":"5934423","onlineDate":"27 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5934581,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Xu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37714494600"},{"name":"Li Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Wang","id":"37311071400"},{"name":"Soon Xin Ng","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Soon Xin","lastName":"Ng","id":"37287759500"},{"name":"Lajos Hanzo","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Lajos","lastName":"Hanzo","id":"37276255400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"5934581","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":438},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Complexity theory","Estimation","Correlation","Bit error rate","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential detection","fading channels","quadrature amplitude modulation","space-time block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-symbol differential sphere detection","differential space-time block code","QAM constellation","MSDD","DSTBC","fading channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Differential space-time block code","multiple-symbol differential sphere detection","QAM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934581","abstract":"We propose Multiple-Symbol Differential Detection (MSDD) aided Differential Space-Time Block Codes (DSTBCs) using QAM.

However, the use of a color filter array for capturing only one of the three color components per pixel introduces color interpolation noise, while the existing methods for extracting PRNU provide no effective means for addressing this issue. Because the artificial colors obtained through the color interpolation process are not directly acquired from the scene by physical hardware, we expect that the PRNU extracted from the physical components, which are free from interpolation noise, should be more reliable than that from the artificial channels, which carry interpolation noise. Based on this assumption we propose a couple-decoupled PRNU (CD-PRNU) extraction method, which first decomposes each color channel into four sub-images and then extracts the PRNU noise from each sub-image. The PRNU noise patterns of the sub-images are then assembled to get the CD-PRNU. This new method can prevent the interpolation noise from propagating into the physical components, thus improving the accuracy of device identification and image content integrity verification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934587/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5934587/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12524317","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Color-Decoupled Photo Response Non-Uniformity for Digital Image Forensics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Color-Decoupled Photo Response Non-Uniformity for Digital Image Forensics","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-li-2160750-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10536S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6145208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"6145208","articleId":"5934587","onlineDate":"27 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5934597,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Ping Hsieh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6088512/5934597/5934597-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yi-Ping Hsieh was born in Tainan, Taiwan, in 1986.

The proposed converter uses coupled-inductor and switched-capacitor techniques. The capacitors are charged in parallel and discharged in series by the coupled inductor to achieve high step-up voltage gain with an appropriate duty ratio. Besides, the voltage stress on the main switch is reduced with a passive clamp circuit; low on-state resistance Rds(on) of the main switch can be adopted to reduce the conduction loss.

Towards this goal, the present paper develops a spline-based approach to field estimation, which relies on a basis expansion model of the field of interest. The model entails known bases, weighted by generic functions estimated from the field's noisy samples. A novel field estimator is developed based on a regularized variational least-squares (LS) criterion that yields finite-dimensional (function) estimates spanned by thin-plate splines. Robustness considerations motivate well the adoption of an overcomplete set of (possibly overlapping) basis functions, while a sparsifying regularizer augmenting the LS cost endows the estimator with the ability to select a few of these bases that \u201cbetter\u201d explain the data. This parsimonious field representation becomes possible, because the sparsity-aware spline-based method of this paper induces a group-Lasso estimator for the coefficients of the thin-plate spline expansions per basis. A distributed algorithm is also developed to obtain the group-Lasso estimator using a network of wireless sensors, or, using multiple processors to balance the load of a single computational unit. The novel spline-based approach is motivated by a spectrum cartography application, in which a set of sensing cognitive radios collaborate to estimate the distribution of RF power in space and frequency. Computer simulations and tests on real data corroborate that the estimated power spectrum density atlas yields the desired RF state awareness, since the maps reveal spatial locations where idle frequency bands can be reused for transmission, even when fading and shadowing effects are pronounced.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2160858","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6017237/05934611.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6017237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2160858","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"4648","endPage":"4663","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Group-Lasso on Splines for Spectrum Cartography","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934611","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Group-Lasso on Splines for Spectrum Cartography","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934611/","volume":"59","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5934611/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12227881","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Group-Lasso on Splines for Spectrum Cartography","sourcePdf":"tsp-giannakis-2160858-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119823S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6017237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"6017237","articleId":"5934611","onlineDate":"27 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5934613,"authors":[{"name":"Pu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6017237/5934613/5934613-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pu Wang (M'11) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2003 and 2006, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, in 2011, all in electrical engineering.","He was an intern at the Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL), Cambridge, MA, in summer 2010.

Our study is motivated by the fact that the multistatic transmit-receive configuration in a distributed MIMO radar causes nonstationary clutter. Specifically, the clutter power for the same test cell may vary significantly from one transmit-receive pair to another, due to azimuth-selective backscattering of the clutter. To account for these issues, a new nonhomogeneous clutter model, where the clutter resides in a low-rank subspace with different subspace coefficients (and hence different clutter power) for different transmit-receive pair, is introduced and the relation to a general clutter model is discussed. Following the proposed clutter model, we develop a generalized-likelihood ratio test (GLRT) for moving target detection in distributed MIMO radar. The GLRT is shown to be a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector, and the test statistic is a central and noncentral Beta variable under the null and alternative hypotheses, respectively. Simulations are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed GLRT in comparison with several existing techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2160861","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6017237/05934613.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2160861","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6017237","startPage":"4809","endPage":"4820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Moving Target Detection Using Distributed MIMO Radar in Clutter With Nonhomogeneous Power","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934613","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Moving Target Detection Using Distributed MIMO Radar in Clutter With Nonhomogeneous Power","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934613/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12227883","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5934613/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Moving Target Detection Using Distributed MIMO Radar in Clutter With Nonhomogeneous Power","sourcePdf":"tsp-li-2160861-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090466S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6017237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"6017237","articleId":"5934613","onlineDate":"27 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5934614,"authors":[{"name":"Kanke Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6017237/5934614/5934614-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kanke Gao (S'11) received the B.S. degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2004 and the M.S. degree from the State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, in 2007, both in electrical engineering.","From 2004 to 2005, he was an R&D Engineer with ZhongKeFanHua M&C Company, Limited, Alliance Program of National Instruments.

In the presence of measurement noise, recovery of the generalized-polygon sampled signals can be carried out effectively using a belief propagation algorithm. Experimental studies included in this paper illustrate our theoretical developments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934614/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5934614/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12227884","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Compressive Sampling With Generalized Polygons","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive Sampling With Generalized Polygons","sourcePdf":"tsp-pados-2160860-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073916S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6017237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6017237","articleId":"5934614","onlineDate":"27 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5934618,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Incidentally, similar challenges arise in tokamak plasma diagnostics' data processing where the spectral complexity of characteristic signals poses additional obstacles. Building up on previous Kalman filter based developments, this paper describes an adaptive real-time algorithm for simultaneous multi-component frequency tracking and harmonic estimation in noisy signals. Furthermore, the proposed gain adaptation method is shown to improve estimation performance in cases where the amplitude ratio of signal components differs by roughly up to three orders of magnitude. A series of selectively devised tests were carried out for challenging the performance and determining the operational limits of the algorithm when aiming to provide accurate estimates, in real-time, of both instantaneous amplitude and phase plus the instantaneous frequency evolution of dominant tones in noisy signals. Finally, results and performance issues are discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934618/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12205841","htmlLink":"/document/5934618/","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Algorithm for Real-Time Multi-Tone Estimation and Frequency Tracking of Non-Stationary Signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Algorithm for Real-Time Multi-Tone Estimation and Frequency Tracking of Non-Stationary Signals","sourcePdf":"tns-alves-2157701-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078475S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"5985592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5985592","articleId":"5934618","onlineDate":"27 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5934622,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Yang","id":"38572698000"},{"name":"Ling Shi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Shi","id":"37287511800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"5934622","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":770},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimal scheduling","Schedules","Estimation error","Cost function","Time measurement","Job shop scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance analysis","estimation theory","Kalman filters","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deterministic sensor data scheduling","limited communication resource","finite time-horizon sensor data scheduling","remote estimator","terminal estimation error covariance","optimal data scheduling","performance metrics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Communication constraint","Kalman filter","remote state estimation","sensor data scheduling"]}],"abstract":"We consider finite time-horizon sensor data scheduling under limited communication resource.

For type I, the excess interference (relative to the Poisson case) increases exponentially in the hard-core distance, while for type II, the gap never exceeds 1 dB.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2011.061611.110960","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/5986793/05934671.pdf","startPage":"792","endPage":"794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5986793","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2011.061611.110960","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mean Interference in Hard-Core Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934671","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","displayDocTitle":"Mean Interference in Hard-Core Wireless Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934671/","publicationDate":"August 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12181808","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5934671/","volume":"15","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mean Interference in Hard-Core Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"792-cl1108-haenggi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067651S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"5986793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"173","xplore-issue":"5986793","articleId":"5934671","onlineDate":"30 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5934672,"authors":[{"name":"Shaowei Wang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology and the School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shaowei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538887500"},{"name":"Fangjiang Huang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Fangjiang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37713253900"},{"name":"Zhi-Hua Zhou","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhi-Hua","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37335606000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"5934672","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":919},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Resource management","Complexity theory","Cognitive radio","Mathematical model","Equations","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","cognitive radio","communication complexity","frequency allocation","OFDM modulation","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast power allocation algorithm","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM-based cognitive radio network","optimal power allocation","suboptimal solution","Newton step","barrier method","linear complexity approximation","optimization problem","heuristic method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","convex optimization","OFDM","resource allocation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2011.061611.110963","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/5986793/05934672.pdf","startPage":"845","endPage":"847","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5986793","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2011.061611.110963","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Power Allocation Algorithm for Cognitive Radio Networks","abstract":"A fast algorithm is proposed to tackle the optimal power allocation problem for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based cognitive radio networks, where the key is to replace the Newton step with O(N^3) complexity in the barrier method by a procedure with approximate linear complexity developed based on the structure of the optimization problem.

Therefore, the proposed detector can utilize the channel frequency domain coherence to further decrease its computational complexity with a controlled performance loss.

Proposed methods allocate alternative multiple antenna transmission modes depending on the SNR, modulation order and Doppler frequency to increase reliability, i.e., decrease bit-error-rate (BER). A major difference of our approach from previous works is to allow different transmission modes during a single frame by considering the channel variations within the frame for high mobility scenarios. First method effectively makes use of available channel knowledge by allocating beamforming (BF) as long as channel knowledge is not outdated and switches to space frequency block coding (SFBC) afterwards. Approximate BER expressions for BF and SFBC that are functions of SNR, modulation order, Doppler frequency and initial channel knowledge are derived to be used as a decision metric for mode allocation throughout the frame. Second method adapts rate and transmission mode across symbols in a frame by considering that average channel power is monotonically decreasing as a function of time within the frame when multiuser diversity is exploited. First method performs as good as the better of BF and SFBC over all SNR values. Second method provides additional performance gain over the first method due to more efficient use of better channel conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.062111.090659","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6020878/05934675.pdf","startPage":"2585","endPage":"2594","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.062111.090659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6020878","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intra-Frame Transmission Adaptation for Fast Fading MIMO-OFDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934675","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934675/","displayDocTitle":"Intra-Frame Transmission Adaptation for Fast Fading MIMO-OFDMA Systems","volume":"59","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 2011","accessionNumber":"12228294","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5934675/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intra-Frame Transmission Adaptation for Fast Fading MIMO-OFDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"2585-tc1109-keci.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098462S","chronDate":"September  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6020878","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6020878","articleId":"5934675","onlineDate":"30 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5934676,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6020878/5934676/5934676-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qing Wang received the B.S. degree in the School of Information Science and Engineering from Shan-dong University, Jinan, China, in 2006.

For such networks, we investigate the impact of the relay positioning on the performance. In particular, considering an opportunistic protocol based on the use of relaying buffers, we provide sets of constraints which, when satisfied, give sufficient conditions for simultaneously guaranteeing network stability and throughput improvement. These results are given for both symmetric and asymmetric relay locations. In contrast to prior work dealing with the diamond relay network, we also break the strong hypothesis of no interlink interference between the source and relay transmissions. Our results provide design guidelines for relay selection by establishing areas of feasible relay locations, whilst also identifying optimal positions which lead to maximum throughput gain.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Position Selection of Relays in Diamond Relay Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.062011.090665","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6020878/05934676.pdf","startPage":"2515","endPage":"2527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.062011.090665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6020878","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934676","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934676/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2011","displayDocTitle":"On the Position Selection of Relays in Diamond Relay Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5934676/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","publicationDate":"September 2011","accessionNumber":"12228295","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Position Selection of Relays in Diamond Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"2515-tc1109-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161583S","chronDate":"September  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6020878","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6020878","articleId":"5934676","onlineDate":"30 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5934678,"authors":[{"name":"Ran Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6020878/5934678/5934678-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ran Xu (S'08) received his B.Eng. degree in information engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China, in 2006 and his M.Sc. degree (with distinction) in communication systems and signal processing from the University of Bristol, Bristol, UK, in 2008.

It is shown that the proposed BFA can achieve more than twice the decoding throughput compared to the conventional unidirectional Fano algorithm (UFA) and there is higher throughput improvement at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This new BFA decoding technique is applied in the parallel convolutional decoding architecture in very high throughput systems, such as the WirelessHD system. Due to the variability in the decoding delays of the parallel codewords, a scheduler is introduced in the parallel Fano decoding architecture which can dynamically allocate the idle decoders to assist with decoding the other parallel codewords in a bidirectional manner. It is shown that the proposed parallel Fano decoding with scheduling can dramatically increase the decoding throughput compared to the parallel Fano decoding without scheduling, and its computational complexity is much lower than that of parallel Viterbi decoding, especially at high SNR. The performance of the parallel Fano decoding with different scheduling schemes is also compared and analyzed in detail in the paper.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6020878","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.062011.100236","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6020878/05934678.pdf","startPage":"2394","endPage":"2405","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.062011.100236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Throughput Parallel Fano Decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2011","displayDocTitle":"High Throughput Parallel Fano Decoding","volume":"59","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5934678/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 2011","accessionNumber":"12228297","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934678/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Throughput Parallel Fano Decoding","sourcePdf":"2394-tc1109-xu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063231S","chronDate":"September  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6020878","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6020878","articleId":"5934678","onlineDate":"30 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5934679,"authors":[{"name":"Hong-Chuan Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Hong-Chuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37278138800"},{"name":"Peng Lu","affiliation":["Research in Motion, Inc., ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Lu","id":"37403808600"},{"name":"Hyung-Ki Sung","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyung-Ki","lastName":"Sung","id":"37830689200"},{"name":"Young-Chai Ko","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Chai","lastName":"Ko","id":"37279007700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"5934679","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":753},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"Random unitary beamforming (RUB) is an attractive transmission scheme for MIMO broadcast channels because of its ability to achieve high sum-rate capacity with limited feedback.

Due to the array architecture difference, conventional wideband angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation and beamforming techniques are not applicable to such wideband hybrid arrays. Targeted at point-to-point line-of-sight wireless transmission in the 70/80 GHz E bands, a unified frequency-domain AoA estimation and beamforming algorithm suitable for large scale wideband hybrid arrays of both interleaved and side-by-side sub-arrays is proposed in this paper. The AoA estimation performance is analyzed by deriving a recursive modified Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (MCRB). The effect of mutual coupling among antenna elements on the estimation performance is also considered for the hybrid array of side-by-side sub-arrays. The analytical results can be used to determine system parameters according to required system specifications. Simulation results show that the proposed AoA estimation algorithm is robust against practical impairments, and the frequency dependency of the array pattern is significantly reduced after digital beamforming.

The presented algorithm aims at scheduling the users at identical slots over different blocks, in order to reduce the necessary scheduling overhead, and to minimize the maximum delay between serving the same user. Thus, the presented algorithm is especially suited for real-time multimedia traffic. The algorithm allocates the users using orthogonal beamforming based on the quantized feedback provided by the users. The quantized feedback consists of the estimated power that is necessary to fulfill a predefined SINR constraint. Further, we propose an algorithm to design codebooks to quantize the estimated power. Using the feedback, the base station redistributes power from users with spare power to users that lack power so that they fulfill their SINR constraints. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated through simulations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.062011.091736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5985568","startPage":"2486","endPage":"2496","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5985568/05934685.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Round-Robin Scheduling for Orthogonal Beamforming with Limited Feedback","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5934685/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Round-Robin Scheduling for Orthogonal Beamforming with Limited Feedback","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12205962","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"8","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Round-Robin Scheduling for Orthogonal Beamforming with Limited Feedback","sourcePdf":"2486-tw1108-simon.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074097S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5985568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5985568","articleId":"5934685","onlineDate":"30 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5934687,"authors":[{"name":"Mirette Sadek","affiliation":["Physical Sciences and Engineering Division, King Abdullah University for Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mirette","lastName":"Sadek","id":"37274032700"},{"name":"Sonia Aissa","affiliation":["University of Quebec, Montreal, QUE, Canada","KAUST, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Sonia","lastName":"Aissa","id":"37273216100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5934687","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1916},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"abstract":"In downlink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmissions, several precoding schemes have been proposed to decrease interference among users.

In this paper, leveraging the efficiency of the SLNR optimization, we generalize this precoding scheme to MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) multi-user systems where the OFDM is used to overcome the inter-symbol-interference (ISI) introduced by multipath channels. We also introduce a channel compensation technique that reconstructs the channel at the transmitter for every time instant given a significantly lower channel feedback rate by the receiver.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5985568/05934687.pdf","startPage":"2428","endPage":"2433","publicationTitle":"IEEE

GHz high-speed radio systems in hospital environments. Two possible applications of those systems are considered: real-time video streaming for angiography and for ultrasonic inspection. Channel modeling was performed for the path loss and multipath characteristics of the propagation channel, i.e., the delay spreads. Results revealed generally lower path loss and delay spread values compared to regular indoor office and residential environments. The results indicate that the 60 GHz radio systems operating in hospital environments can provide better signal quality and wider coverage than those operated in regular indoor environments, though increased interference with neighboring cells might be an unfortunate consequence.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement Based Path Loss and Delay Spread Modeling in Hospital Environments at 60 GHz","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.062211.101601","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5985568/05934688.pdf","startPage":"2423","endPage":"2427","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.062211.101601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5985568","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934688","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934688/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","displayDocTitle":"Measurement Based Path Loss and Delay Spread Modeling in Hospital Environments at 60 GHz","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5934688/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12205964","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement Based Path Loss and Delay Spread Modeling in Hospital Environments at 60 GHz","sourcePdf":"2423-tw1108-kyro.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085345S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5985568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5985568","articleId":"5934688","onlineDate":"30 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5934690,"authors":[{"name":"Jingook Kim","affiliation":["Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Laboratory, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5983338/5934690/5934690-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jingook Kim (M'09) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2000, 2002, and 2006, respectively.","He has been involved with power/signal integrity, package modeling in gigahertz systems, as well as EMI/electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) design.

The portions of the plane net and via net inductances are quantified, and the contribution of each plane current to the plane net inductance is quantitatively analyzed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5983338/05934690.pdf","startPage":"1909","endPage":"1924","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2011.2156807","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2011.2156807","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5983338","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934690","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inductance Calculations for Plane-Pair Area Fills With Vias in a Power Distribution Network Using a Cavity Model and Partial Inductances","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inductance","Cavity resonators","Integrated circuit modeling","Computational modeling","Impedance","Capacitors","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","inductance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inductance calculation","plane-pair area fill","power distribution network","partial inductance","resonant cavity model","partial-element equivalent-circuit","PEEC","PDN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cavity model","decoupling capacitor","equivalent inductance","inductance","parallel plate","partial element equivalent circuit (PEEC)","partial inductance","power distribution network (PDN)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934690/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Inductance Calculations for Plane-Pair Area Fills With Vias in a Power Distribution Network Using a Cavity Model and Partial Inductances","volume":"59","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5934690/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12171733","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inductance Calculations for Plane-Pair Area Fills With Vias in a Power Distribution Network Using a Cavity Model and Partial Inductances","sourcePdf":"tmtt-fan-2156807-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081778S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5983338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5983338","articleId":"5934690","onlineDate":"30 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5934698,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Duan Song","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and the Center of Intelligent Systems and Renewable Energy, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/6082048/5934698/5934698-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yong-Duan Song received the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Tennessee Technological University, Cookeville, in 1992.","He held a tenured Full Professor position with North Carolina A&T State University, Greensboro, from 1993 to 2008 and a Langley Distinguished Professor position with the National Institute of Aerospace, Hampton, VA, from 2005 to 2008.

A robust and adaptive fault-tolerant tracking control strategy is proposed to simultaneously counteract modeling uncertainties, unexpected disturbances, coupling effects, as well as actuator failures. By introducing the virtual points along the longitudinal centerline of the vehicle and utilizing a state transformation, a special feature of the control gain matrix is revealed, which allows for the development of structurally simple and computationally inexpensive robust adaptive and fault-tolerant control algorithms. The closed-loop stability issues of the control scheme are analyzed using a Lyapunov-based method. A nonlinear dynamic model of a passenger vehicle is developed to simulate the performance of control design.

Although DSMLs provide such benefits, there is implied (or hidden) modeling effort---in terms of user actions---associated with using a DSML that can negatively impact its effectiveness. It is therefore critical that DSML developers understand the meaning of modeling effort and how to reduce it so their DSML is of high quality. This paper provides two contributions to research on developing DSMLs. First, the paper defines a metric for measuring model effort. Secondly, this paper discusses several techniques, with examples, reducing (or improving) modeling effort. The techniques discussed in the paper have been applied to an open-source DSML called the Platform Independent Component Modeling Language (PICML), which is currently used in both academic and industry settings for designing and implementing large-scale distributed systems. Finally, results show that it is possible to reduce modeling effort without requiring user studies to analyze such concerns.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934783","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECBS.2011.22","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference and Workshops on Engineering of Computer-Based Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference and Workshops on Engineering of Computer-Based Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5934782/5934783/05934812.pdf","startPage":"120","endPage":"129","doi":"10.1109/ECBS.2011.22","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measuring and Reducing Modeling Effort in Domain-Specific Modeling Languages with Examples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Measuring and Reducing Modeling Effort in Domain-Specific Modeling Languages with Examples","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5934812/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12141464","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934812/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measuring and Reducing Modeling Effort in Domain-Specific Modeling Languages with Examples","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"4379a120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067451S","chronDate":"27-29 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5934782","isNumber":"5934783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5934782","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5934783","articleId":"5934812","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5934849,"authors":[{"name":"Greg Goth","affiliation":["Freelance Technology, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Greg Goth is a freelance technology writer based in Connecticut.","\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Selected CS articles and columns L!lIJ are also available for free at http://ComputingNow.computer.org."]},"firstName":"Greg","lastName":"Goth","id":"37283389700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7801"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0131"}],"articleNumber":"5934849","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2625},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Internet","Standards","Data security","IP networks","Protocols","Software","Telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["granular computing","open systems","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software-defined networking","network traffic control","production scale infrastructure","networking industry","dubbed OpenFlow","open networking foundation","ONF","commercial deployment","software providers","content delivery networks","networking equipment vendors","granular control","data traffic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OpenFlow","Open Networking Foundation","network traffic control","IPv6 deployment","Internet computing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934849","doi":"10.1109/MIC.2011.96","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIC.2011.96","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934844","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4236/5934844/05934849.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software-Defined Networking Could Shake Up More than Packets","abstract":"Anew approach to network traffic control - born out of university researchers' desire to conduct experiments on production scale infrastructure and based on a slim, six page white paper - is taking the networking industry by storm.

The retrieval latency in content clouds depends on content availability in the edge nodes, which in turn depends on the caching policy at the edge nodes. In case of local content unavailability (i.e., a cache miss), edge nodes resort to source selection strategies to retrieve the content items either vertically from the central server, or horizontally from other edge nodes. Consequently, managing the latency in content clouds needs to take into account several interrelated issues: asymmetric bandwidth and caching capacity for both source types as well as edge node heterogeneity in terms of caching policies and source selection strategies applied. In this paper, we study the problem of minimizing the retrieval latency considering both caching and retrieval capacity of the edge nodes and server simultaneously. We derive analytical models to evaluate the content retrieval latency under two source selection strategies, i.e., Random and Shortest-Queue, and three caching policies: selfish, collective, and a novel caching policy that we call the adaptive caching policy. Our analysis allows the quantification of the interrelated performance impacts of caching and retrieval capacity and the exploration of the corresponding design space. In particular, we show that the adaptive caching policy combined with Shortest-Queue selection scales well with various network configurations and adapts to the load changes in our simulation and analytical results.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934883","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05934883.pdf","startPage":"1080","endPage":"1088","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimizing retrieval latency for content cloud","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934883","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934883/","displayDocTitle":"Minimizing retrieval latency for content cloud","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085676","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5934883/","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimizing retrieval latency for content cloud","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p1080bjorkqvist.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072287S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5934883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5934886,"authors":[{"name":"Honghai Zhang","affiliation":["Mobile Communications and Networking Research, NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Honghai","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280794700"},{"name":"Yuanxi Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology, China","Mobile Communications and Networking Research, NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Yuanxi","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37715325600"},{"name":"Sampath Rangarajan","affiliation":["Mobile Communications and Networking Research, NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Sampath","lastName":"Rangarajan","id":"37282909600"},{"name":"Baohua Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Baohua","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37291565700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5934886","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":475},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934886","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Approximation methods","Approximation algorithms","Complexity theory","Streaming media","Switches","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","approximation theory","array signal processing","image resolution","image sequences","indoor radio","multicast communication","multimedia communication","video communication","video signal processing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless multicast video delivery","switched beamforming antenna","indoor wireless network","channel quality","multicast group","SINR","wireless multicast video transmission","indoor environment","beam selection","beam scheduling","multiresolution video","multilayered video","delay constraint","video quality","NP-hard","unified approximation algorithm","algorithm complexity","approximation factor","heuristic solution","hypothetical video sequence","real video sequence"]}],"doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934886","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05934886.pdf","startPage":"1107","endPage":"1115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934886","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multicast video delivery with switched beamforming antennas in indoor wireless networks","abstract":"Wireless multicast based video delivery is constrained by the user with the lowest channel quality within a multicast group. Beamforming increases the SINR at the clients thereby increasing the minimum channel quality among the users that form the multicast group. Thus it can be utilized to enhance the wireless multicast video transmission. In this paper, we investigate how to exploit switched beamforming antennas to improve wireless multicast based video transmission in indoor environments. The fundamental problem to be solved is the selection and scheduling of beams to be used to cover different subsets of users within the multicast group. We consider both multi-resolution videos and multi-layered videos and formulate the problem as maximizing the total utility of all multicast clients subject to a total delay constraint, where the utility is a general measure of video quality or user-satisfaction. We prove that it is NP-hard to have a (1-1/e+\u03b5)-approximation solution to this problem for any \u03b5 >; 0, under both multi-resolution and multi-layered video models. For the multi-resolution video model, we develop a unified approximation algorithm with a parameter k that controls both the algorithm complexity and the approximation factor. For k = 0, 1, 2, 3, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves an approximation guarantee close to 0.31, 0.38, 0.55, and 0.63, respectively. For the multi-layered video model, we propose a similar heuristic solution. The proposed algorithms are evaluated with both hypothetical video sequences and real video sequences using channel data collected in an indoor wireless testbed. Evaluation results show that the proposed algorithms have much better performance than naive multicast algorithms for scheduling the beams.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934886/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12085679","publicationDate":"April 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5934886/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multicast video delivery with switched beamforming antennas in indoor wireless networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicast video delivery with switched beamforming antennas in indoor wireless networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p1107zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098212S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5934886","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5934888,"authors":[{"name":"David L\u00f3pez-P\u00e9rez","affiliation":["Centre of Telecommunications Research, King''s College, UK"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"L\u00f3pez-P\u00e9rez","id":"38277422500"},{"name":"\u00c1kos Lad\u00e1nyi","affiliation":["Centre of Wireless Network Design, University of Bedfordshire, Luton, UK"],"firstName":"\u00c1kos","lastName":"Lad\u00e1nyi","id":"38321428400"},{"name":"Alp\u00e1r J\u00fcttner","affiliation":["Centre of Wireless Network Design, University of Bedfordshire, Luton, UK"],"firstName":"Alp\u00e1r","lastName":"J\u00fcttner","id":"37398645200"},{"name":"Herve Rivano","affiliation":["Centre of Innovation in Telecommunications and Integration of services, INSA, Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Herve","lastName":"Rivano","id":"37658894100"},{"name":"Jie Zhang","affiliation":["Centre of Wireless Network Design, University of Bedfordshire, Luton, UK"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37281474400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5934888","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":106,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2141},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Interference","Optimization","Macrocell networks","Throughput","OFDM","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decomposition","encoding","Long Term Evolution","modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimization method","joint allocation","modulation schemes","coding rates","resource blocks","self-organizing LTE networks","subcarriers","inter-cell interference mitigation","dynamic cell self-organization","distributed cell self-organization","frequency planning","two-level decomposition method","near optimal solutions","optimization problem"]}],"abstract":"This article investigates the problem of the allocation of modulation and coding, subcarriers and power to users in LTE.

Recent work has demonstrated that wireless devices can generate a shared secret key by exploiting variations in their channel. The rate at which the secret bits are generated, however, depends heavily on how fast the channel changes. As a result, existing schemes have a low secrecy rate and are mainly applicable to mobile environments. In contrast, this paper presents a new physical-layer approach to secret key generation that is both fast and independent of channel variations. Our approach makes a receiver jam the signal in a manner that still allows it to decode the data, yet prevents other nodes from decoding. Results from a testbed implementation show that our method is significantly faster and more accurate than state of the art physical-layer secret key generation protocols. Specifically, while past work generates up to 44 secret bits/s with a 4% bit disagreement between the two devices, our design has a secrecy rate of 3-18 Kb/s with 0% bit disagreement.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934889","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","startPage":"1125","endPage":"1133","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05934889.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical layer wireless security made fast and channel independent","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934889/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5934889/","displayDocTitle":"Physical layer wireless security made fast and channel independent","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085682","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical layer wireless security made fast and channel independent","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p1125gollakota.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124926S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5934889","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5934892,"authors":[{"name":"Pallavi Arora","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Pallavi","lastName":"Arora","id":"37717560800"},{"name":"Csaba Szepesv\u00e1ri","affiliation":["Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Csaba","lastName":"Szepesv\u00e1ri","id":"37374885300"},{"name":"Rong Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37285841600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5934892","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":498},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Joints","Wireless networks","Performance evaluation","Resource management","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","learning (artificial intelligence)","radio networks","telecommunication computing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sequential learning","optimal monitoring","multichannel wireless network","transmission activity monitoring","linear partial monitoring problem","multiarmed bandits","sniffer-channel assignment","linear bandit model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934892","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934892","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","abstract":"We consider the problem of optimally assigning p sniffers to K channels to monitor the transmission activities in a multi-channel wireless network. The activity of users is initially unknown to the sniffers and is to be learned along with channel assignment decisions while maximizing the benefits of this assignment, resulting in the fundamental trade-off between exploration versus exploitation. We formulate it as the linear partial monitoring problem, a super-class of multi-armed bandits. As the number of arms (sniffer-channel assignments) is exponential, novel techniques are called for, to allow efficient learning. We use the linear bandit model to capture the dependency amongst the arms and develop two policies that take advantage of this dependency. Both policies enjoy logarithmic regret bound of time-slots with a term that is sub-linear in the number of arms.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","startPage":"1152","endPage":"1160","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05934892.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential learning for optimal monitoring of multi-channel wireless networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934892/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5934892/","displayDocTitle":"Sequential learning for optimal monitoring of multi-channel wireless networks","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085685","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential learning for optimal monitoring of multi-channel wireless networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p1152arora.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123224S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5934892","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5934894,"authors":[{"name":"Seyoung Yun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seyoung","lastName":"Yun","id":"37708937300"},{"name":"Yung Yi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yung","lastName":"Yi","id":"37274318600"},{"name":"Dong-Ho Cho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Ho","lastName":"Cho","id":"37276179200"},{"name":"Jeonghoon Mo","affiliation":["Department of Information and Industrial Engineering, Yonsei University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jeonghoon","lastName":"Mo","id":"37290863700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5934894","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":873},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pricing","Femtocells","Games","Economics","Biological system modeling","Subscriptions","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","game theory","power control","resource allocation","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocell networks","wireless data traffic","resource control","power control","load balancing","game theoretic models","macro BSs","mobile-only","open-femto service"]}],"abstract":"The femtocell is an enabling technology to handle exponentially increasing wireless data traffic.

They however entail high communication overhead for maintenance, when some of the encoded fragments are lost and need to be replenished. Such overheads arise from the fundamental need to recreate (or keep separately) first a copy of the whole object before any individual encoded fragment can be generated and replenished. There has recently been intense interest to explore alternatives, most prominent ones being regenerating codes (RGC) and hierarchical codes (HC). We propose as an alternative a new family of codes to improve the maintenance process, called self-repairing codes (SRC), with the following salient features: (a) encoded fragments can be repaired directly from other subsets of encoded fragments by downloading less data than the size of the complete object, ensuring that (b) a fragment is repaired from a fixed number of encoded fragments, the number depending only on how many encoded blocks are missing and independent of which specific blocks are missing. These properties allow for not only low communication overhead to recreate a missing fragment, but also independent reconstruction of different missing fragments in parallel, possibly in different parts of the network. The fundamental difference between SRCs and HCs is that different encoded fragments in HCs do not have symmetric roles (equal importance). Consequently the number of fragments required to replenish a specific fragment in HCs depends on which specific fragments are missing, and not solely on how many. Likewise, object reconstruction may need different number of fragments depending on which fragments are missing. RGCs apply network coding over (n, k) erasure codes, and provide network information flow based limits on the minimal maintenance overheads. RGCs need to communicate with at least k other nodes to recreate any fragment, and the minimal overhead is achieved if only one fragment is missing, and information is downloaded from all the other n-1 nodes. We analyze the static resilience of SRCs with respect to erasure codes, and observe that SRCs incur marginally larger storage overhead in order to achieve the aforementioned properties. The salient SRC properties naturally translate to low communication overheads for reconstruction of lost fragments, and allow reconstruction with lower latency by facilitating repairs in parallel. These desirable properties make SRC a practical candidate for networked distributed storage systems.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934901","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05934901.pdf","startPage":"1215","endPage":"1223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-repairing homomorphic codes for distributed storage systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Self-repairing homomorphic codes for distributed storage systems","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5934901/","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085694","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934901/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-repairing homomorphic codes for distributed storage systems","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p1215oggier.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096781S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"152","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5934901","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5934906,"authors":[{"name":"Shreeshankar Bodas","affiliation":["Department of EECS, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Shreeshankar","lastName":"Bodas","id":"37398916500"},{"name":"Sanjay Shakkottai","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Texas, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Sanjay","lastName":"Shakkottai","id":"37283351900"},{"name":"Lei Ying","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Iowa State University, USA"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Ying","id":"37306027600"},{"name":"R.

To understand the potential MPR advantages, we study link scheduling in an ad hoc network with SIC at the physical layer. The fact that the links detected sequentially by SIC are correlated at the receiver poses key technical challenges. We characterize the link dependence and propose simultaneity graph (SG) to capture the effect of SIC. Then interference number is defined to measure the interference of a link. We show that scheduling over SG is NP-hard and the maximum interference number bounds the performance of maximal greedy schemes. An independent set based greedy scheme is explored to efficiently construct a maximal feasible schedule. Moreover, with careful selection of link ordering, we present a scheduling scheme that improves the bound. The performance is evaluated by both simulations and measurements in testbed. The throughput gain is on average 40% and up to 120% over IEEE 802.11.

In PW-MAC, nodes each wake up to receive at randomized, asynchronous times. PW-MAC minimizes sensor node energy consumption by enabling senders to predict receiver wakeup times; to enable accurate predictions, PW-MAC introduces an on-demand prediction error correction mechanism that effectively addresses timing challenges such as unpredictable hardware and operating system delays and clock drift. PW-MAC also introduces an efficient prediction-based retransmission mechanism to achieve high energy efficiency even when wireless collisions occur and packets must be retransmitted. We evaluate PW-MAC on a testbed of MICAz motes and compare it to X-MAC, WiseMAC, and RI-MAC, three previous energy-efficient MAC protocols, under multiple concurrent multihop traffic flows and under hidden-terminal scenarios and scenarios in which nodes have wakeup schedule conflicts. In all experiments, PW-MAC significantly outperformed these other protocols. For example, evaluated on scenarios with 15 concurrent transceivers in the network, the average sender duty cycle for X-MAC, WiseMAC, and RI-MAC were all over 66%, while PW-MAC's average sender duty cycle was only 11%; the delivery latency for PW-MAC in these scenarios was less than 5% that for WiseMAC and X-MAC.

To perform energy-aware server provisioning, ACES faces three key tradeoffs between cost, performance, and reliability: (1) maximizing energy savings vs. minimizing unmet load demand, (2) managing low power draw vs. high transition latencies for multiple power management schemes, and (3) balancing energy savings vs. reliability costs of server components due to on-off cycles. To address these challenges, ACES (1) predicts demand in the near future to turn on servers gradually before they are needed and avoids turning on unnecessary servers to cope with transient load spikes, (2) formulates an optimization problem that minimizes a linear combination of unmet demand and total energy and reliability costs, and uses the program structure to solve the problem efficiently in practice, and (3) constructs an execution plan based on the optimization decisions to transition servers between different power states and actuates them using system and load management interfaces. Our evaluation on three data center workloads shows that ACES's energy savings are close to the optimal and it delivers power proportionality while balancing the tradeoff between energy savings and reliability costs.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934917","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05934917.pdf","startPage":"1332","endPage":"1340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Managing cost, performance, and reliability tradeoffs for energy-aware server provisioning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934917","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934917/","displayDocTitle":"Managing cost, performance, and reliability tradeoffs for energy-aware server provisioning","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085710","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5934917/","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Managing cost, performance, and reliability tradeoffs for energy-aware server provisioning","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p1332guenter.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074014S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"152","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5934917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5934919,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Shi","affiliation":["Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Shi","id":"37276885400"},{"name":"Liguang Xie","affiliation":["Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Liguang","lastName":"Xie","id":"37629756200"},{"name":"Y.

Thus, finite network lifetime is widely regarded as a fundamental performance bottleneck. Recent breakthrough in the area of wireless energy transfer offers the potential of removing such performance bottleneck, i.e., allowing a sensor network remain operational forever. In this paper, we investigate the operation of a sensor network under this new enabling energy transfer technology. We consider the scenario of a mobile charging vehicle periodically traveling inside the sensor network and charging each sensor node's battery wirelessly. We introduce the concept of renewable energy cycle and offer both necessary and sufficient conditions. We study an optimization problem, with the objective of maximizing the ratio of the wireless charging vehicle (WCV)'s vacation time over the cycle time. For this problem, we prove that the optimal traveling path for the WCV is the shortest Hamiltonian cycle and provide a number of important properties. Subsequently, we develop a near-optimal solution and prove its performance guarantee.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934919/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12085712","htmlLink":"/document/5934919/","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"On renewable sensor networks with wireless energy transfer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On renewable sensor networks with wireless energy transfer","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p1350shi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.130883S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"229","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5934919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5934921,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Li","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Li","id":"37308664400"},{"name":"Jiangwei Yu","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Jiangwei","lastName":"Yu","id":"37714576300"},{"name":"Junbiao Yu","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Junbiao","lastName":"Yu","id":"37089092976"},{"name":"Jianping Wu","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Jianping","lastName":"Wu","id":"37279158500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5934921","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":917},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934921","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Receivers","Servers","Topology","Buildings","Approximation algorithms","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","computer centres","multicast protocols","routing protocols","telecommunication network topology","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable multicast routing protocol","data center networks","network traffic","low-end switch","source-to-receiver expansion approach","regular topology","Steiner-tree algorithm","bloom filter","computation complexity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934921","startPage":"1368","endPage":"1376","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05934921.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring efficient and scalable multicast routing in future data center networks","abstract":"Multicast benefits group communications in saving network traffic and improving application throughput, both of which are important for data center applications.

Several interesting approaches have been developed and demonstrated for their feasibility. The state-of-the-art, however, still has much room for improving their practicality. This is because i) the key bit generation rate supported by most existing approaches is very low which significantly limits their practical usage given the intermittent connectivity in mobile environments; ii) existing approaches suffer from the scalability and flexibility issues, i.e., they cannot be directly extended to support efficient group key generation and do not suit for static environments. With these observations in mind, we present a new secret key generation approach that utilizes the uniformly distributed phase information of channel responses to extract shared cryptographic keys under narrowband multipath fading models. The proposed approach enjoys a high key bit generation rate due to its efficient introduction of multiple randomized phase information within a single coherence time interval as the keying sources. The proposed approach also provides scalability and flexibility because it relies only on the transmission of periodical extensions of unmodulated sinusoidal beacons, which allows effective accumulation of channel phases across multiple nodes. The proposed scheme is thoroughly evaluated through both analytical and simulation studies. Compared to existing work that focus on pairwise key generation, our approach is highly scalable and can improve the analytical key bit generation rate by a couple of orders of magnitude.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934929/","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12085722","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5934929/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fast and scalable secret key generation exploiting channel phase randomness in wireless networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and scalable secret key generation exploiting channel phase randomness in wireless networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p1422wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090706S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"142","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5934929","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5934939,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407534500"},{"name":"Xiaojun Cao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaojun","lastName":"Cao","id":"37276620400"},{"name":"Yi Pan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Pan","id":"37275624000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5934939","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":221,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":3062},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Routing","Resource management","Optical fiber networks","Indexes","Upper bound","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","integer programming","linear programming","OFDM modulation","optical fibre networks","optical modulation","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum-sliced elastic optical path networks","OFDM-based optical networks","multicarrier modulation technique","wavelength routed networks","spectrum efficiency","frequency-resource saving","routing and spectrum allocation problem","SLICE network","NP-hard problem","integer linear programming","RSA problem","upper bounds","lower bounds","balanced load spectrum allocation algorithm","BLSA algorithm","ILP model"]}],"abstract":"In OFDM-based optical networks, multiple subcarriers can be allocated to accommodate various size of traffic demands. By using the multi-carrier modulation technique, subcarriers for the same node-pair can be overlapping in the spectrum domain. Compared to the traditional wavelength routed networks (WRNs), the OFDM-based Spectrum-sliced Elastic Optical Path (SLICE) network has higher spectrum efficiency due to its finer granularity and frequency-resource saving. In this work, for the first time, we comprehensively study the routing and spectrum allocation (RSA) problem in the SLICE network. After proving the NP-hardness of the static RSA problem, we formulate the RSA problem using the Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulations to optimally minimize the maximum number of sub-carriers required on any fiber of a SLICE network. We then analyze the lower/upper bounds for the sub-carrier number in a network with general or specific topology. We also propose two efficient algorithms, namely, balanced load spectrum allocation (BLSA) algorithm and shortest path with maximum spectrum reuse (SPSR) algorithm to minimize the required sub-carrier number in a SLICE network. The results show that the proposed algorithms can match the analysis and approximate the optimal solutions using the ILP model.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of the routing and spectrum allocation in spectrum-sliced Elastic Optical Path networks","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934939","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05934939.pdf","startPage":"1503","endPage":"1511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934939","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934939/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"A study of the routing and spectrum allocation in spectrum-sliced Elastic Optical Path networks","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5934939/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085732","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of the routing and spectrum allocation in spectrum-sliced Elastic Optical Path networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p1503wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090267S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"221","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5934939","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5934940,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew Johnston","affiliation":["Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Johnston","id":"37710907400"},{"name":"Hyang-Won Lee","affiliation":["Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Hyang-Won","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280127700"},{"name":"Eytan Modiano","affiliation":["Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Eytan","lastName":"Modiano","id":"37280630000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5934940","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":370},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacity planning","Robustness","Optimization","Routing","Probabilistic logic","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer networks","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust optimization approach","backup network design","random failures","random link failures","probabilistic survivability guarantees","over-provisioning","optimal backup routing","optimal backup networks","resource sharing","simulated annealing"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a scheme in which a dedicated backup network is designed to provide protection from random link failures. Upon a link failure in the primary network, traffic is rerouted through a preplanned path in the backup network. We introduce a novel approach for dealing with random link failures, in which probabilistic survivability guarantees are provided to limit capacity over-provisioning. We show that the optimal backup routing strategy in this respect depends on the reliability of the primary network. Specifically, as primary links become less likely to fail, the optimal backup networks employ more resource sharing amongst backup paths. We apply results from the field of robust optimization to formulate an ILP for the design and capacity provisioning of these backup networks. We then propose a simulated annealing heuristic to solve this problem for largescale networks, and present simulation results that verify our analysis and approach.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934940","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05934940.pdf","startPage":"1512","endPage":"1520","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust optimization approach to backup network design with random failures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934940","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934940/","displayDocTitle":"A robust optimization approach to backup network design with random failures","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085733","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5934940/","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust optimization approach to backup network design with random failures","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p1512johnston.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060519S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5934940","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":5934945,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Miao","affiliation":["Department of CSE, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Miao","id":"37707461500"},{"name":"Kebin Liu","affiliation":["Department of CSE, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","TNLIST, School of Software, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kebin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37536772300"},{"name":"Yuan He","affiliation":["Department of CSE, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","TNLIST, School of Software, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"He","id":"37398853200"},{"name":"Yunhao Liu","affiliation":["Department of CSE, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yunhao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279413400"},{"name":"Dimitris Papadias","affiliation":["Department of CSE, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Dimitris","lastName":"Papadias","id":"37276740500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5934945","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":541},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Correlation","Covariance matrix","Silicon","Navigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","failure analysis","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["agnostic diagnosis","wireless sensor networks","online lightweight failure detection approach","correlation graphs"]}],"abstract":"In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), diagnosis is a crucial and challenging task due to the distributed nature and stringent resources. Most previous approaches are supervised, relying on a-priori knowledge of network faults. On the other hand, our experience with GreenOrbs, a long-term large-scale WSN system, reveals the need of diagnosis in an agnostic manner. Specifically, in addition to predefined faults (i.e., with known types and symptoms), silent failures that are unknown beforehand, account for a large fraction of network performance degradation. Currently, there is no effective solution for silent failures because they are often diverse and highly system-related. In this paper, we propose Agnostic Diagnosis (AD), an online lightweight failure detection approach. AD is motivated by the fact that the system metrics (e.g., radio-on time, number of packets transmitted) of GreenOrbs sensors usually exhibit certain correlation patterns. Violations of such patterns indicate potential silent failures. We accordingly design a correlation graph, which systematically characterizes internal correlations inside a node. Silent failures are discovered by tracking the changes and anomalies of correlation graphs. We implement AD on a working WSN consisting of 330 nodes. Our experimental results demonstrate the advantages of AD to discover silent failures, effectively expanding the capacity and scope of WSN diagnosis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Agnostic diagnosis: Discovering silent failures in wireless sensor networks","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934945","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05934945.pdf","startPage":"1548","endPage":"1556","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934945","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934945/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Agnostic diagnosis: Discovering silent failures in wireless sensor networks","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5934945/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085738","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Agnostic diagnosis: Discovering silent failures in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p1548miao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062467S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5934945","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5934951,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Jin","affiliation":["Northeastern University, USA"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Jin","id":"37709132400"},{"name":"Guevara Noubir","affiliation":["Northeastern University, USA"],"firstName":"Guevara","lastName":"Noubir","id":"37282492300"},{"name":"Bo Sheng","affiliation":["University of Massachusetts, Boston, USA"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Sheng","id":"37266459400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5934951","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":62,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":1857},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile handsets","Zigbee","IEEE 802.11 Standards","IP networks","Bluetooth","Hardware","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","Internet","wireless LAN","Zigbee"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application-transparent dual ZigBee-WiFi radios","low power Internet access","WiFi access points","unlicensed RF bandwidth","cellular network","dual WiFi-ZigBee radio","mobile phones","WiZi-cloud protocols"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934951","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934951","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","abstract":"The high density ofWiFi Access Points and large unlicensed RF bandwidth over which they operate makes them good candidates to alleviate cellular network's limitations.

In this paper we present a first study of D2D traffic characteristics using the anonymized NetFlow datasets collected at the border routers of five major Yahoo! data centers. Our contributions are mainly two-fold: i) we develop novel heuristics to infer the Yahoo! IP addresses and localize their locations from the anonymized NetFlow datasets, and ii) we study and analyze both D2D and client traffic characteristics and the correlations between these two types of traffic. Our study reveals that Yahoo! uses a hierarchical way of deploying data centers, with several satellite data centers distributed in other countries and backbone data centers distributed in US locations. For Yahoo! US data centers, we separate the client-triggered D2D traffic and background D2D traffic from the aggregate D2D traffic using port based correlation, and study their respective characteristics. Our findings shed light on the interplay of multiple data centers and their traffic dynamics within a large content provider, and provide insights to data center designers and operators as well as researchers.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IP networks","Correlation","Integrated circuits","Satellites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","Internet","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interdata center traffic","Yahoo! datasets","data center management","anonymized NetFlow datasets","IP addresses","client-triggered D2D traffic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Content provider","Inter-data center","NetFlow","Anonymization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934955","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934955","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05934955.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934955","startPage":"1620","endPage":"1628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A first look at inter-data center traffic characteristics via Yahoo! datasets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A first look at inter-data center traffic characteristics via Yahoo! datasets","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934955/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5934955/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085748","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A first look at inter-data center traffic characteristics via Yahoo! datasets","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p1620chen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046633S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5934955","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5934956,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew R.

Several researchers have proposed highly-redundant topologies with multiple paths between pairs of end hosts for datacenter networks. However, traffic management is necessary to effectively utilize the bisection bandwidth provided by these topologies. This requires timely detection of elephant flows-flows that carry large amount of data-and managing those flows. Previously proposed approaches incur high monitoring overheads, consume significant switch resources, and/or have long detection times. We propose, instead, to detect elephant flows at the end hosts. We do this by observing the end hosts's socket buffers, which provide better, more efficient visibility of flow behavior. We present Mahout, a low-overhead yet effective traffic management system that follows OpenFlow-like central controller approach for network management but augments the design with our novel end host mechanism. Once an elephant flow is detected, an end host signals the network controller using in-band signaling with low overheads. Through analytical evaluation and experiments, we demonstrate the benefits of Mahout over previous solutions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934956/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12085749","htmlLink":"/document/5934956/","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Mahout: Low-overhead datacenter traffic management using end-host-based elephant detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mahout: Low-overhead datacenter traffic management using end-host-based elephant detection","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p1629curtis.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056765S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"221","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5934956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5934965,"authors":[{"name":"Gonca G\u00fcrsun","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Boston University, USA"],"firstName":"Gonca","lastName":"G\u00fcrsun","id":"37714102100"},{"name":"Mark Crovella","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Boston University, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Crovella","id":"37321925100"},{"name":"Ibrahim Matta","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Boston University, USA"],"firstName":"Ibrahim","lastName":"Matta","id":"37271703700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5934965","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":77,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":885},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forecasting","Time series analysis","YouTube","Predictive models","Autoregressive processes","Matrix decomposition","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","multimedia systems","principal component analysis","video retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video access pattern forecasting","large-scale social behavior","capacity planners","system designers","YouTube videos","rarely-accessed videos","frequently-accessed videos","daily access patterns","principal component analysis"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Describing and forecasting video access patterns","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","endPage":"20","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05934965.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934965","startPage":"16","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934965","abstract":"Computer systems are increasingly driven by workloads that reflect large-scale social behavior, such as rapid changes in the popularity of media items like videos.

In this paper we make two contributions intended to assist in the design and provisioning of such systems.We analyze an extensive dataset consisting of the daily access counts of hundreds of thousands of YouTube videos. In this dataset, we find that there are two types of videos: those that show rapid changes in popularity, and those that are consistently popular over long time periods. We call these two types rarely-accessed and frequently-accessed videos, respectively. We observe that most of the videos in our data set clearly fall in one of these two types. In this work, we study the frequently-accessed videos by asking two questions: first, is there a relatively simple model that can describe its daily access patterns? And second, can we use this simple model to predict the number of accesses that a video will have in the near future, as a tool for capacity planning? To answer these questions we develop a framework for characterization and forecasting of access patterns. We show that for frequently-accessed videos, daily access patterns can be extracted via principal component analysis, and used efficiently for forecasting.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934965/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12085758","htmlLink":"/document/5934965/","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Describing and forecasting video access patterns","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Describing and forecasting video access patterns","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p16gursun.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045266S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5934965","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-18"},{"_id":5934971,"authors":[{"name":"Michael J.

Continuous aggregation is usually required in many sensor applications to obtain the temporal variation information of some interesting aggregates. However, for the continuous in-network aggregation in a hostile environment, the adversary could manipulate a series of aggregation results through compromised nodes to fabricate false temporal variation patterns of the aggregates. Existing secure aggregation schemes conduct one individual verification for each aggregation result. Due to the high rate and the long period of a continuous aggregation, directly applying these schemes to detect false temporal variation pattern would incur a great communication cost. In this paper, we identify distinct design issues for protecting continuous in-network aggregation and propose a novel scheme to detect false temporal variation patterns. Compared with the existing schemes, our scheme greatly reduces the communication cost by selecting and checking only a small part of aggregation results to verify the correctness of the temporal variation patterns in a time window. The checking of the aggregation results uses a sampling-based approach, which enables our scheme independent of any particular in-network aggregation protocol. We also propose a series of security mechanisms to protect the sampling process. Both theoretical analysis and simulations show the effectiveness and efficiency of our scheme.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Authentication","Aggregates","Heuristic algorithms","Approximation methods","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern recognition","telecommunication security","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure continuous aggregation","sampling-based verification","wireless sensor networks","in-network aggregation","false temporal variation pattern detection","security mechanisms"]}],"doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934974","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05934974.pdf","startPage":"1763","endPage":"1771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934974","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure continuous aggregation via sampling-based verification in wireless sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934974","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Secure continuous aggregation via sampling-based verification in wireless sensor networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934974/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5934974/","accessionNumber":"12085767","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure continuous aggregation via sampling-based verification in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p1763yu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07339S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5934974","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5934975,"authors":[{"name":"Kaustubh Nyalkalkar","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA","Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA"],"firstName":"Kaustubh","lastName":"Nyalkalkar","id":"37705832600"},{"name":"Sushant Sinhay","affiliation":["Yahoo!, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Sushant","lastName":"Sinhay"},{"name":"Michael Bailey","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA","Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Bailey","id":"37578747300"},{"name":"Farnam Jahanian","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA","Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA"],"firstName":"Farnam","lastName":"Jahanian","id":"37275650200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5934975","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":572},"abstract":"Modern networks are complex and hence, network operators often rely on automation to assist in assuring the security, availability, and performance of these networks.

Due to the detrimental effects caused by these anomalies, it is critical to detect them promptly and effectively. There have been numerous softwares, algorithms, or rules developed to conduct anomaly detection over traffic data. However, each of them only has limited descriptions of the anomalies, and thus suffers from high false positive/false negative rates. In contrast, the combination of multiple atomic detectors can provide a more powerful anomaly capturing capability when the base detectors complement each other. In this paper, we propose to infer a discriminative model by reaching consensus among multiple atomic anomaly detectors in an unsupervised manner when there are very few or even no known anomalous events for training. The proposed algorithm produces a perevent based non-trivial weighted combination of the atomic detectors by iteratively maximizing the probabilistic consensus among the output of the base detectors applied to different traffic records. The resulting model is different and not obtainable using Bayesian model averaging or weighted voting. Through experimental results on three network anomaly detection datasets, we show that the combined detector improves over the base detectors by 10% to 20% in accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934982","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05934982.pdf","startPage":"181","endPage":"185","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Consensus extraction from heterogeneous detectors to improve performance over network traffic anomaly detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934982","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934982/","displayDocTitle":"Consensus extraction from heterogeneous detectors to improve performance over network traffic anomaly detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085775","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5934982/","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consensus extraction from heterogeneous detectors to improve performance over network traffic anomaly detection","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p181gao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063053S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5934982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5934986,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Hua E.

On the other hand, converting the NFA to a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) can cause state explosion, where the number of states and transitions in the DFA are exponentially larger than in the NFA. In this paper, we seek to answer the following question: to match an arbitrary set of regular expressions, is there a finite automaton that lies between the NFA and DFA in terms of computation and memory complexities? We introduce the semi-deterministic finite automata (SFA) and the state convolvement test to construct an SFA from a given NFA. An SFA consists of a fixed number (p) of constituent DFAs (c-DFA) running in parallel; each c-DFA is responsible for a subset of states in the original NFA. To match a set of regular expressions with n overlapping symbols (that can match to the same input character concurrently), the NFA can require O(n) computation per input character, whereas the DFA can have a state transition table with O(2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</sup>\n) states. By exploiting the state convolvements during the SFA construction, an equivalent SFA reduces the computation complexity to O(p\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n=c\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) per input character while limiting the space requirement to O(|\u03a3|\u00d7p\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n\u00d7(n=p)\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">c</sup>\n) states, where \u03a3 is the alphabet and c \u2265 1 is a small design constant. Although the problem of constructing the optimal (minimum-sized) SFA is shown to be NP-complete, we develop a greedy heuristic to quickly construct a near-optimal SFA in time and space quadratic in the number of states in the original NFA. We demonstrate our SFA construction using real-world regular expressions taken from the Snort IDS.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05934986.pdf","startPage":"1853","endPage":"1861","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934986","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5934986","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-time tradeoff in regular expression matching with semi-deterministic finite automata","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doped fiber amplifiers","Explosions","Automata","Complexity theory","Throughput","Computer architecture","Pattern matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","deterministic automata","finite automata","greedy algorithms","pattern matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["regular expression matching","space-time tradeoff","semi-deterministic finite automata","nondeterministic finite automata","deterministic finite automaton","state explosion","NP-complete problem","greedy heuristic","computation complexity","memory complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Regular expression","deep packet inspection","NFA","DFA","graph coloring","Aho-Corasick algorithm","state explosion","space-time tradeoff"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934986/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Space-time tradeoff in regular expression matching with semi-deterministic finite automata","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5934986/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085779","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-time tradeoff in regular expression matching with semi-deterministic finite automata","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p1853yang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078267S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5934986","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5934987,"authors":[{"name":"Fengyuan Xu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, College of William and Mary, USA"],"firstName":"Fengyuan","lastName":"Xu","id":"37401238300"},{"name":"Zhengrui Qin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, College of William and Mary, USA"],"firstName":"Zhengrui","lastName":"Qin","id":"37712132600"},{"name":"Chiu C.

Periodically changed pseudonyms are used by the mobile devices to protect source location privacy from each other, and from the untrusted location proof server. We also develop user-centric location privacy model in which individual users evaluate their location privacy levels in real-time and decide whether and when to accept a location proof exchange request based on their location privacy levels. APPLAUS can be implemented with the existing network infrastructure and the current mobile devices, and can be easily deployed in Bluetooth enabled mobile devices with little computation or power cost.

Such fruits have not been fully benefited at the network layer mainly due to the computational complexity associated with the matrix-based model that MIMO involves. Recently, there are some efforts to simplify link layer model for MIMO so as to ease research for the upper layers. These models only require numeric computations on MIMO's degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) for spatial multiplexing (SM) and interference cancellation (IC) to obtain a feasible rate region. Thus, these models are much simpler than the original matrix-based model from the communications world. However, none of these DoF-based models is shown to achieve the same rate region as that by the matrix-based model. In this paper, we re-visit this important problem of MIMO modeling. Based on accurate accounting of how DoFs are consumed, we develop a simple link layer model for multi-hop MIMO networks. We show that this model is optimal in the sense of achieving the same rate region as that by the matrix-based model under SM and IC for any network topology.

All these graphs are connected (provided the original graph is connected) planar. Hypocomb has unbounded degree while Reduced Hypocomb and Local Hypocomb have maximum degree 6 and 8, respectively. To our knowledge, Local Hypocomb is the first strictly-localized, degree-bounded planar graph computed using merely 1-hop neighbor position information.

However, these systems do not consider the different amounts of trust represented by different graphs, and different levels of trust between nodes, though trust is being a crucial requirement in these systems. For instance, co-authors in an academic collaboration graph are trusted in a different manner than social friends. Furthermore, some social friends are more trusted than others. However, previous designs for social network-based Sybil defenses have not considered the inherent trust properties of the graphs they use. In this paper we introduce several designs to tune the performance of Sybil defenses by accounting for differential trust in social graphs and modeling these trust values by biasing random walks performed on these graphs. Surprisingly, we find that the cost function, the required length of random walks to accept all honest nodes with overwhelming probability, is much greater in graphs with high trust values, such as co-author graphs, than in graphs with low trust values such as online social networks. We show that this behavior is due to the community structure in high-trust graphs, requiring longer walk to traverse multiple communities. Furthermore, we show that our proposed designs to account for trust, while increase the cost function of graphs with low trust value, decrease the advantage of attacker.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934998","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05934998.pdf","startPage":"1943","endPage":"1951","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Keep your friends close: Incorporating trust into social network-based Sybil defenses","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Keep your friends close: Incorporating trust into social network-based Sybil defenses","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12085791","publicationDate":"April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5934998/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5934998/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Keep your friends close: Incorporating trust into social network-based Sybil defenses","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p1943mohaisen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113947S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5934998","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5935000,"authors":[{"name":"Sastry Kompella","affiliation":["Information Technology Division, Naval Research Laboratory, Inc., Washington D.C., DC, USA"],"firstName":"Sastry","lastName":"Kompella","id":"37317255100"},{"name":"Gam D.

In particular, we characterize the stable-throughput region in a two user cognitive shared channel where the primary (higher priority) user transmits whenever it has packets to transmit while the secondary (cognitive) node transmits its packets with probability p. Therefore, in this system, the secondary link is allowed to share the channel along with the primary link, in contrast to the traditional notion of cognitive radio, in which the secondary user is required to relinquish the channel as soon as the primary is detected. The analysis also takes into account the compound effects of multi-packet reception as well as of the relaying capability on the stability region of the network. We start by analyzing the non-cooperation case where nodes transmit their own packets to their respective destinations. We then extend the analysis to a system where the secondary node cooperatively relays some of the primary's packets. Specifically, in the cooperation case, the secondary node relays those packets that it receives successfully from the primary, but are not decoded properly by the primary destination. In such cognitive shared channels, a tradeoff arises in terms of activating the secondary along with the primary so that both transmissions may be successful, but with a lower probability, compared to the case of the secondary node staying idle when the primary user transmits. Results show the benefits of relaying for both the primary as well as the secondary nodes in terms of the stable-throughput region.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935000","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935000.pdf","startPage":"1961","endPage":"1969","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stable throughput tradeoffs in cognitive shared channels with cooperative relaying","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935000/","displayDocTitle":"Stable throughput tradeoffs in cognitive shared channels with cooperative relaying","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085793","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935000/","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stable throughput tradeoffs in cognitive shared channels with cooperative relaying","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p1961kompella.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.215474S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5935005,"authors":[{"name":"Zengfeng Huang","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Zengfeng Huang","id":"37087558767"},{"name":"Ke Yi","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Ke Yi","id":"37087530669"},{"name":"Yunhao Liu","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Yunhao Liu","id":"37087186584"},{"name":"Guihai Chen","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"lastName":"Guihai Chen","id":"37087193852"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935005","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":266},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935005","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Algorithm design and analysis","Peer to peer computing","Distributed databases","Encoding","Probabilistic logic","Approximation algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","distributed processing","frequency estimation","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal sampling algorithm","global frequency estimation","distributed system","Bloom filter"]}],"abstract":"Consider a distributed system with n nodes where each node holds a multiset of items.

Content-aware processing at the front end of distributed network systems, such as application identification for datacenter load-balancers and deep packet inspection for security gateways, is more challenging due to the wire-speed and low-latency requirement. Existing work focuses on algorithm-level solutions while lacking system-level design to meet the critical requirement for front-end content processing. In this paper, we propose a system-level solution named FEACAN for front-end acceleration of content-aware network processing. FEACAN employs a software-hardware co-design supporting both signature matching and regular expression matching for content-aware network processing. A two-dimensional DFA compression algorithm is designed to reduce the memory usage and a hardware lookup engine is proposed for high-performance lookup. Experimental results show that FEACAN achieves better performance than existing work in terms of processing speed, resource utilization, and update time.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FEACAN: Front-end acceleration for content-aware network processing","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935021","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935021.pdf","startPage":"2114","endPage":"2122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935021","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935021/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"FEACAN: Front-end acceleration for content-aware network processing","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935021/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085814","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FEACAN: Front-end acceleration for content-aware network processing","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p2114qi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062997S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935021","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5935024,"authors":[{"name":"Tingwen Liu","affiliation":["Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tingwen","lastName":"Liu","id":"37407006800"},{"name":"Yifu Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Yifu","lastName":"Yang","id":"37716464400"},{"name":"Yanbing Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Yanbing","lastName":"Liu","id":"37715372500"},{"name":"Yong Sun","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Sun","id":"37404471600"},{"name":"Li Guo","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"lastName":"Li Guo","id":"37288442100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935024","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":457},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doped fiber amplifiers","Compression algorithms","Sparse matrices","Memory management","Pattern matching","Clustering algorithms","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","deterministic automata","finite automata","pattern matching","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["regular expression compression algorithm","network security","deep packet inspection","deterministic finite automata","pattern matching","DFA engine"]}],"abstract":"Deep packet inspection plays a increasingly important role in network security devices and applications, which use more regular expressions to depict patterns. DFA engine is usually used as a classical representation for regular expressions to perform pattern matching, because it only need O(1) time to process one input character. However, DFAs of regular expression sets require large amount of memory, which limits the practical application of regular expressions in high-speed networks. Some compression algorithms have been proposed to address this issue in recent literatures. In this paper, we reconsider this problem from a new perspective, namely observing the characteristic of transition distribution inside each state, which is different from previous algorithms that observe transition characteristic among states. Furthermore, we introduce a new compression algorithm which can reduce 95% memory usage of DFA stably without significant impact on matching speed. Moreover, our work is orthogonal to previous compression algorithms, such as D2FA, \u03b4FA. Our experiment results show that applying our work to them will have several times memory reduction, and matching speed of up to dozens of times comparing with original \u03b4FA in software implementation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient regular expressions compression algorithm from a new perspective","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935024","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935024.pdf","startPage":"2129","endPage":"2137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935024","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935024/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"An efficient regular expressions compression algorithm from a new perspective","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935024/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085817","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient regular expressions compression algorithm from a new perspective","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p2129liu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080291S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935024","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":5935026,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodong Lin","affiliation":["Faculty of Business and Information Technology, University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT), Oshawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Lin","id":"37289264200"},{"name":"Rongxing Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Rongxing","lastName":"Lu","id":"37309741500"},{"name":"Xiaohui Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Xiaohui","lastName":"Liang","id":"37716367100"},{"name":"Xuemin Shen","affiliation":["Faculty of Business and Information Technology, University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT), Oshawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Xuemin","lastName":"Shen","id":"37065811100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935026","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1060},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935026","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Privacy","Protocols","Receivers","Delay","Authentication","Cities and towns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data privacy","routing protocols","vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["social-tier-assisted packet forwarding protocol","STAP","receiver-location privacy preservation","vehicular ad hoc networks","privacy-preserving VANET","roadside units","virtual social tier","exact location information","conditional privacy preservation","delivery ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["VANETs","Packet forwarding","Social-tier-assisted","Receiver-location privacy preservation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935026","startPage":"2147","endPage":"2155","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935026.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"STAP: A social-tier-assisted packet forwarding protocol for achieving receiver-location privacy preservation in VANETs","abstract":"Receiver-location privacy is an important security requirement in privacy-preserving Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs), yet the unavailable receiver's location information makes many existing packet forwarding protocols inefficient in VANETs. To tackle this challenging issue, in this paper, we propose an efficient social-tier-assisted packet forwarding protocol, called STAP, for achieving receiver-location privacy preservation in VANETs. Specifically, by observing the phenomena that vehicles often visit some social spots, such as well-traversed shopping malls and busy intersections in a city environment, we deploy storage-rich Roadside Units (RSUs) at social spots and form a virtual social tier with them. Then, without knowing the receiver's exact location information, a packet can be first forwarded and disseminated in the social tier. Later, once the receiver visits one of social spots, it can successfully receive the packet. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed STAP protocol can protect the receiver's location privacy against an active global adversary, and achieve vehicle's conditional privacy preservation as well. In addition, performance evaluation via extensive simulations demonstrates its efficiency in terms of high delivery ratio and low average delay.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935026/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5935026/","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085819","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"STAP: A social-tier-assisted packet forwarding protocol for achieving receiver-location privacy preservation in VANETs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"STAP: A social-tier-assisted packet forwarding protocol for achieving receiver-location privacy preservation in VANETs","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p2147lin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064229S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935026","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5935028,"authors":[{"name":"Yunchuan Wei","affiliation":["School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China","Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yunchuan","lastName":"Wei","id":"37716824400"},{"name":"Kai Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37285934000"},{"name":"Prasant Mohapatra","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Prasant","lastName":"Mohapatra","id":"37283726400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935028","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":397},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Entropy","Wireless communication","Probes","Complexity theory","Adaptive systems","Communication system security","Calculators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","three-term control","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive wireless channel probing","shared key generation","bit generation rate","channel resource consumption","Lempel-Ziv complexity","LZ76","proportional-integral-derivative controller","PID controller"]}],"abstract":"Generating a shared key between two parties from the wireless channel is of increasing interest. The procedure for obtaining information from wireless channel is called channel probing. Previous works used a constant channel probing rate to generate a key, but they neither consider the tradeoff between the bit generation rate (BGR) and channel resource consumption, nor adjust the probing rate according to different scenarios. In order to satisfy users' requirement for BGR and to use the wireless channel efficiently, we first build a mathematical model of channel probing and derive the relationship between BGR and probing rate. Second, we introduce an adaptive channel probing system based on Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZ76) and Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. Our scheme uses LZ76 to estimate the entropy rate of the channel statistics, e.g. the Received Signal Strength (RSS), and uses the PID controller to control the channel probing rate. Our experiments show that this system is able to dynamically adjust its probing rate to achieve a desired BGR under different moving speeds, different mobile types, and different sites. Our results also show that the standard deviation of the LZ76 calculator is less than 0.15 bits/s. The PID controller is able to stabilize the bit generation rate at a desired value with mean error of less than 0.9 bits/s.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935028","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935028.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935028","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","startPage":"2165","endPage":"2173","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive wireless channel probing for shared key generation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935028","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive wireless channel probing for shared key generation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935028/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935028/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085821","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive wireless channel probing for shared key generation","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p2165wei.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099816S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935028","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5935031,"authors":[{"name":"Yuchen Wu","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Yuchen","lastName":"Wu","id":"37717024300"},{"name":"Yanmin Zhu","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Yanmin","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37280223500"},{"name":"Bo Li","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiaotong University, China","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Bo Li","id":"37280001600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935031","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1027},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Routing","Trajectory","Prediction algorithms","Mobile communication","Algorithm design and analysis","Entropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["entropy","Markov processes","mobile radio","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data delivery","vehicular network","network disruption","topological change","mobility uncertainty","vehicular trajectory knowledge","trace datasets","urban environment","conditional entropy analysis","spatiotemporal regularity","mobile pattern","trajectory prediction","multiple order Markov chains","packet delivery probability","routing algorithm","vehicle trajectory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["trajectory","routing","vehicular networks","prediction","Markov chain"]}],"abstract":"Efficient data delivery is a great challenge in vehicular networks because of frequent network disruption, fast topological change and mobility uncertainty. The vehicular trajectory knowledge plays a key role in data delivery. Existing algorithms have largely made predictions on the trajectory with coarse-grained patterns such as spatial distribution or/and the inter-meeting time distribution, which has led to poor data delivery performance. In this paper, we mine the extensive trace datasets of vehicles in an urban environment through conditional entropy analysis, we find that there exists strong spatiotemporal regularity. By extracting mobile patterns from historical traces, we develop accurate trajectory predictions by using multiple order Markov chains. Based on an analytical model, we theoretically derive packet delivery probability with predicted trajectories. We then propose routing algorithms taking full advantage of predicted vehicle trajectories. Finally, we carry out extensive simulations based on real traces of vehicles. The results demonstrate that our proposed routing algorithms can achieve significantly higher delivery ratio at lower cost when compared with existing algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trajectory improves data delivery in vehicular networks","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935031","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935031.pdf","startPage":"2183","endPage":"2191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935031","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935031/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Trajectory improves data delivery in vehicular networks","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935031/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085824","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trajectory improves data delivery in vehicular networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p2183wu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054897S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935031","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5935035,"authors":[{"name":"Wentao Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Wentao","lastName":"Huang","id":"37532637300"},{"name":"Xinbing Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Xinbing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281375300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935035","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":42,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":744},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935035","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Protocols","Throughput","Delay","Ad hoc networks","Signal to noise ratio","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay scaling","cognitive networks","decision model","hybrid protocol model","round-robin TDMA","classic static networks","random walk mobility","hybrid networks","multicast networks","hierarchically cooperative networks","clustered networks"]}],"abstract":"There has been recent interest within the networking research community to understand how performance scales in cognitive networks with overlapping n primary nodes and m secondary nodes. Two important metrics, i.e., throughput and delay, are studied in this paper. We first propose a simple and extendable decision model, i.e., the hybrid protocol model, for the secondary nodes to exploit spatial gap among primary transmissions for frequency reuse. Then a framework for general cognitive networks is established based on the hybrid protocol model to analyze the occurrence of transmission opportunities for secondary nodes. We show that in the case that the transmission range of the secondary network is smaller than that of the primary network in order, as long as the primary network operates in a generalized round-robin TDMA fashion, the hybrid protocol model suffice to guide the secondary network to achieve the same throughput and delay scaling as a standalone network, without harming the transmissions of the primary network. Our approach is general in the sense that we only make a few weak assumptions on both networks, and therefore obtains a wide variety of results. We show secondary networks can obtain the same order of throughput and delay as standalone networks when primary networks are classic static networks, networks with random walk mobility, hybrid networks, multicast networks, hierarchically cooperative networks or clustered networks. Our work presents a relatively complete picture of the performance scaling of cognitive networks and provides fundamental insight on the design of them.","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935035.pdf","startPage":"2210","endPage":"2218","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935035","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput and delay scaling of general cognitive networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935035/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Throughput and delay scaling of general cognitive networks","htmlLink":"/document/5935035/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12085828","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput and delay scaling of general cognitive networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p2210huang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070123S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5935036,"authors":[{"name":"Lara Deek","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Santa Barbara, USA"],"firstName":"Lara","lastName":"Deek","id":"37704744100"},{"name":"Xia Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Santa Barbara, USA"],"firstName":"Xia","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37310870300"},{"name":"Kevin Almeroth","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Santa Barbara, USA"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Almeroth","id":"37267918200"},{"name":"Haitao Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Santa Barbara, USA"],"firstName":"Haitao","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37333494700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935036","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":69,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":404},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Pricing","Resists","Three dimensional displays","Uncertainty","Time frequency analysis","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bin packing","electronic commerce","frequency allocation","Internet","pricing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tackling bid","time-based cheating","online spectrum auctions","spectrum on-the-fly","bidder manipulation","selfish bidders","auction performance","Topaz","truthful online spectrum auction design","3D bin packing mechanism","distribute spectrum across time","allocation efficiency","temporal-smoothed critical value based pricing","temporal dependency","spatial dependency","time-cheating","scalable winner preemption","auction revenue","bidder behavior","optimal spectrum allocation","spectrum utilization"]}],"abstract":"Online spectrum auctions offer ample flexibility for bidders to request and obtain spectrum on-the-fly. Such flexibility, however, opens up new vulnerabilities to bidder manipulation. Aside from rigging their bids, selfish bidders can falsely report their arrival time to game the system and obtain unfair advantage over others. Such time-based cheating is easy to perform yet produces severe damage to auction performance. We propose Topaz, a truthful online spectrum auction design that distributes spectrum efficiently while discouraging bidders from misreporting their bids or time report. Topaz makes three key contributions. First, Topaz applies a 3D bin packing mechanism to distribute spectrum across time, space and frequency, exploiting spatial and time reuse to improve allocation efficiency. Second, Topaz enforces truthfulness using a novel temporal-smoothed critical value based pricing. Capturing the temporal and spatial dependency among bidders who arrive subsequently, this pricing effectively diminishes gain from bid and/or time-cheating. Finally, Topaz offers a \u201cscalable\u201d winner preemption to address the uncertainty of future arrivals at each decision time, which significantly boosts auction revenue. We analytically prove Topaz's truthfulness, which does not require any knowledge of bidder behavior, or an optimal spectrum allocation to enforce truthfulness. Using empirical arrival and bidding models, we perform simulations to demonstrate the efficiency of Topaz. We show that proper winner preemption improves auction revenue by 45-65% at a minimum cost of spectrum utilization.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"To preempt or not: Tackling bid and time-based cheating in online spectrum auctions","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935036","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935036.pdf","startPage":"2219","endPage":"2227","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935036","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935036/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"To preempt or not: Tackling bid and time-based cheating in online spectrum auctions","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935036/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085829","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"To preempt or not: Tackling bid and time-based cheating in online spectrum auctions","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p2219deek.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092851S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935036","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5935038,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37310081700"},{"name":"Hongseok Kim","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Alcatel-Lucent, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Hongseok","lastName":"Kim","id":"37406279100"},{"name":"Junshan Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Junshan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37281464300"},{"name":"Mung Chiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Mung","lastName":"Chiang","id":"37273230100"},{"name":"Chee Wei Tan","affiliation":["City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Chee Wei","lastName":"Tan","id":"37309056200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935038","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":884},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935038","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pricing","Multiaccess communication","Monopoly","Throughput","Access control","Games","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier sense multiple access","cognitive radio","game theory","Pareto optimisation","pricing","radio access networks","radio networks","radio spectrum management","telecommunication control","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pricing-based spectrum access control","cognitive radio networks","market-based mechanism","random access","monopoly primary user market model","multiple PU market model","secondary users","pricing-based spectrum trading mechanism","slotted Aloha","revenue maximization problem","Pareto optimal solution","spectrum utilization","three-stage Stackelberg game","Nash equilibrium","CSMA"]}],"doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935038","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935038.pdf","startPage":"2228","endPage":"2236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pricing-based spectrum access control in cognitive radio networks with random access","abstract":"Market-based mechanisms offer promising approaches for spectrum access in cognitive radio networks. In this paper, we focus on two market models, one with a monopoly primary user (PU) market and the other with a multiple PU market, where each PU sells its temporarily unused spectrum to secondary users (SUs). We propose a pricing-based spectrum trading mechanism that enables SUs to contend for channel usage by random access, in a distributed manner, which naturally mitigates the complexity and time overhead associated with centralized scheduling. For the monopoly PU market model, we first consider SUs contending via slotted Aloha. The revenue maximization problems here are nonconvex. We first characterize the Pareto optimal region, and then obtain a Pareto optimal solution that maximizes the SUs' throughput subject to the SUs' budget constraints. To mitigate the spectrum underutilization due to the \u201cprice of contention,\u201d we revisit the problem where SUs contend via CSMA, and show that spectrum utilization is enhanced, resulting in higher revenue. When the PU's unused spectrum is a control parameter, we study further the tradeoff between the PU's utility and its revenue. For the multiple PU market model, we cast the competition among PUs as a three-stage Stackelberg game, where each SU selects a PU's channel to maximize its throughput. We characterize the Nash equilibria, in terms of access prices and the spectrum offered to SUs. Our findings reveal that the number of equilibria exhibits a phase transition phenomenon, in the sense that when the number of PUs is greater than a threshold, there exist infinitely many equilibria; otherwise, there exists a unique Nash equilibrium, where the access prices and spectrum opportunities are determined by the budgets/elasticity of SUs and the utility level of PUs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935038/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12085831","publicationDate":"April 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935038/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Pricing-based spectrum access control in cognitive radio networks with random access","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pricing-based spectrum access control in cognitive radio networks with random access","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p2228yang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0972S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935038","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5935039,"authors":[{"name":"Miao Pan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Miao","lastName":"Pan","id":"37398541500"},{"name":"Chi Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Chi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37288987900"},{"name":"Pan Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mississippi State University, MS, USA"],"firstName":"Pan","lastName":"Li","id":"37402666600"},{"name":"Yuguang Fang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Yuguang","lastName":"Fang","id":"37736259800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935039","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":69,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":830},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Optical wavelength conversion","Positron emission tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","computational complexity","mathematical analysis","scheduling","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint routing","link scheduling","cognitive radio networks","uncertain spectrum supply","licensed spectrum supply","multihop CR networks","mathematical formulation","optimization problem","coarse-grained fixing algorithm","NP-hard problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935039","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935039","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","abstract":"The essential impediment to apply cognitive radio (CR) technology for spectrum utilization improvement lies in the uncertainty of licensed spectrum supply.

Simulation results show that i) for any (\u03b1, \u03b2) level, the proposed algorithm provides a near-optimal solution to the formulated NP-hard problem; ii) the (\u03b1, \u03b2) based solution is better than expected bandwidth based one in terms of blocking ratio as well as spectrum utilization in CR networks..","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","startPage":"2237","endPage":"2245","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935039.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint routing and link scheduling for cognitive radio networks under uncertain spectrum supply","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935039/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5935039/","displayDocTitle":"Joint routing and link scheduling for cognitive radio networks under uncertain spectrum supply","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085832","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint routing and link scheduling for cognitive radio networks under uncertain spectrum supply","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p2237pan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.134873S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5935041,"authors":[{"name":"Bowu Zhang","affiliation":["Computer Science, George Washington University, Washington D.C., DC, USA"],"firstName":"Bowu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37715346700"},{"name":"Xiuzhen Cheng","affiliation":["Computer Science, George Washington University, Washington D.C., DC, USA"],"firstName":"Xiuzhen","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37273146300"},{"name":"Nan Zhang","affiliation":["Computer Science, George Washington University, Washington D.C., DC, USA"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37288736400"},{"name":"Yong Cui","affiliation":["Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Cui","id":"37272670700"},{"name":"Yingshu Li","affiliation":["Computer Science, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Yingshu","lastName":"Li","id":"37292401500"},{"name":"Qilian Liang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, University of Technology, Arlington, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Qilian","lastName":"Liang","id":"37272705100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935041","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":114,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1664},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matching pursuit algorithms","Compressed sensing","Sparse matrices","Algorithm design and analysis","Argon","Sensors","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["greedy algorithms","iterative methods","probability","sensor placement","signal detection","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse target counting","sensor localization","compressive sensing","wireless sensor networks","CS","greedy matching pursuit algorithm","signal recovery algorithms","GMP","probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sensor networks","target counting","target localization","compressive sensing"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel compressive sensing (CS) based approach for sparse target counting and positioning in wireless sensor networks.

The finite-horizon problem is important and challenging because it necessitates optimizing metrics over the short term rather than metrics that are averaged over a long period of time. Unlike the infinite-horizon problem, the fact that inefficiencies cannot be made to vanish to infinitesimally small values, means that the finite-horizon problem requires more delicate control. The finite-horizon throughput optimization problem can be formulated as a convex optimization problem, but turns out to be highly complex. The complexity is brought about by the \u201ctime coupling property,\u201d which implies that current decisions can influence future performance. To address this problem, we employ a three-step approach. First, we focus on the throughput maximization problem for a single node with renewable energy assuming that the replenishment rate profile for the entire finite-horizon period is known in advance. An energy allocation scheme that is equivalent to computing a shortest path in a simply-connected space is developed and proven to be optimal. We then relax the assumption that the future replenishment profile is known and develop an online algorithm. The online algorithm guarantees a fraction of the optimal throughput. Motivated by these results, we propose a low-complexity heuristic distributed scheme, called NetOnline, in a rechargeable sensor network. We prove that this heuristic scheme is optimal under homogeneous replenishment profiles. Further, in more general settings, we show via simulations that NetOnline significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art infinite-horizon based scheme, and for certain configurations using data collected from a testbed sensor network, it achieves empirical performance close to optimal.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935044/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935044/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12085837","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Finite-horizon energy allocation and routing scheme in rechargeable sensor networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-horizon energy allocation and routing scheme in rechargeable sensor networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p2273chen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07834S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935044","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5935054,"authors":[{"name":"Myungjin Lee","affiliation":["Purdue University, USA"],"firstName":"Myungjin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37405524300"},{"name":"Mohammad Hajjat","affiliation":["Purdue University, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Hajjat","id":"37704677800"},{"name":"Ramana Rao Kompella","affiliation":["Purdue University, USA"],"firstName":"Ramana Rao","lastName":"Kompella","id":"37299687000"},{"name":"Sanjay Rao","affiliation":["Purdue University, USA"],"firstName":"Sanjay","lastName":"Rao","id":"37291304500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935054","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"abstract":"The Internet has significantly evolved in the number and variety of applications.

When unlicensed (secondary) users opportunistically share spectrum with licensed (primary or incumbent) users, a given rendezvous channel may become unavailable due to the appearance of licensed user signals, which makes rendezvous impossible. Ideally, any node pair should be able to rendezvous over every available channel to minimize the possibility of such rendezvous failures. Channel hopping (CH) protocols have been proposed previously for establishing pairwise rendezvous. Some of them enable pairwise rendezvous over all channels but require global clock synchronization, which is very difficult to achieve in decentralized networks. In this paper, we present a systematic approach, called asynchronous channel hopping (ACH), for designing CH-based rendezvous protocols for decentralized CR networks. The resulting protocols are resistant to rendezvous failures caused by the appearance of primary user signals and do not require clock synchronization. We propose an optimal ACH design that maximizes the rendezvous probability between any pair of nodes, and show its rendezvous performance via simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935056","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935056.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935056","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","startPage":"236","endPage":"240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous channel hopping for establishing rendezvous in cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935056","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous channel hopping for establishing rendezvous in cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935056/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935056/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085849","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous channel hopping for establishing rendezvous in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p236bian.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082523S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5935060,"authors":[{"name":"Mikko S\u00e4rel\u00e4","affiliation":["Ericsson Research Limited, Germany"],"firstName":"Mikko","lastName":"S\u00e4rel\u00e4","id":"37704581700"},{"name":"Christian Esteve Rothenberg","affiliation":["State University of Campinas-UNICAMP, Brazil"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Esteve Rothenberg","id":"37704561400"},{"name":"Tuomas Aura","affiliation":["Aalto University, Finland"],"firstName":"Tuomas","lastName":"Aura","id":"37269404800"},{"name":"Andr\u00e1s Zahemszky","affiliation":["Ericsson Research Limited, Germany"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e1s","lastName":"Zahemszky","id":"37545825400"},{"name":"Pekka Nikander","affiliation":["Ericsson Research Limited, Germany"],"firstName":"Pekka","lastName":"Nikander","id":"37394955000"},{"name":"J\u00f6rg Ott","affiliation":["Aalto University, Finland"],"firstName":"J\u00f6rg","lastName":"Ott","id":"37268907400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935060","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":42,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":408},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Peer to peer computing","Storms","Bandwidth","Internet","Routing protocols","History"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicast protocols","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly forwarding","in-packet Bloom filters","multicast tree encoding","routing decisions","Bloom filter-based multicast protocols","packet forwarding","BloomCast","source-specific inter-domain multicast protocol"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935060","abstract":"Several recently proposed multicast protocols use in-packet Bloom filters to encode multicast trees. These mechanisms are in principle highly scalable because no per-flow state is required in the routers and because routing decisions can be made efficiently by simply checking for the presence of outbound links in the filter. Yet, the viability of previous approaches is limited by the possibility of forwarding anomalies caused by false positives inherent in Bloom filters. This paper explores such anomalies, namely (1) packets storms, (2) forwarding loops and (3) flow duplication. We propose stateless solutions that increase the robustness and the scalability of Bloom filter-based multicast protocols. In particular, we show that the parameters of the filter need to be varied to guarantee the stability of the packet forwarding, and we present a bit permutation technique that effectively prevents both accidental and maliciously created anomalies. We evaluate our solutions in the context of BloomCast, a source-specific inter-domain multicast protocol, using analytical methods and simulations.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935060","startPage":"2399","endPage":"2407","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935060.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forwarding anomalies in Bloom filter-based multicast","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935060/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Forwarding anomalies in Bloom filter-based multicast","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935060/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12085852","publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forwarding anomalies in Bloom filter-based multicast","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p2399sarela.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077069S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935060","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5935063,"authors":[{"name":"Chengzhi Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Chengzhi","lastName":"Li","id":"37403928600"},{"name":"Huaiyu Dai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Huaiyu","lastName":"Dai","id":"37335980600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935063","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":453},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935063","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Road transportation","Routing","Interference","Protocols","Transmitters","Slabs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio technology","ad hoc networks","throughput scaling","heterogeneous networks","secondary network","cognitive users","primary network","licensed users","overlaid networks","node density","network throughput","scaling law"]}],"doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935063","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935063.pdf","startPage":"241","endPage":"245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the throughput scaling of Cognitive Radio ad hoc networks","abstract":"Due to the emergence of Cognitive Radio, a special type of heterogeneous networks attracts increasing interest recently, in which a secondary network composed of cognitive users shares the same resources opportunistically with a primary network of licensed users. Network throughput in this setting is of essential importance. Some pioneer works in this area showed that this type of heterogeneous networks performs as well as two stand-alone networks, under the dense network model where the size of a network grows with the node density in a fixed area. A key assumption behind this conclusion is that the density of the secondary network is higher than that of the primary one in the order sense, which essentially decouples the two overlaid networks, as the secondary network dominates asymptotically. In this paper we endeavor to investigate this problem with a weaker condition that the dimensions of the two overlaid networks are on the same order, and consider the extended network model where the size of a network scales with the area with the node density fixed. Surprisingly, our analysis shows that this weaker (and arguably more practical) condition does not degrade either network throughput in terms of scaling law. Our result further reveals the potentials of CR technology in real applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935063/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12085855","publicationDate":"April 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935063/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On the throughput scaling of Cognitive Radio ad hoc networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the throughput scaling of Cognitive Radio ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p241li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050685S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5935066,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyong Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China","Department of Computer Science, GuangDong Polytechnic Normal University, GuangZhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhiyong","lastName":"Lin","id":"37714217400"},{"name":"Hai Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279507400"},{"name":"Xiaowen Chu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Xiaowen","lastName":"Chu","id":"37271636500"},{"name":"Yiu-Wing Leung","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yiu-Wing","lastName":"Leung","id":"37271603500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935066","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":127,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1187},"abstract":"Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) have emerged as advanced and promising paradigm to exploit the existing wireless spectrum opportunistically. It is crucial for users in CRNs to search for neighbors via rendezvous process and thereby establish the communication links to exchange the information necessary for spectrum management and channel contention etc. This paper focuses on the design of algorithms for blind rendezvous, i.e., rendezvous without using any central controller and common control channel (CCC). We propose a jump-stay based channel-hopping (CH) algorithm for blind rendezvous. The basic idea is to generate CH sequence in rounds and each round consists of a jump-pattern and a stay-pattern. Users \u201cjump\u201d on available channels in the jump-pattern while \u201cstay\u201d on a specific channel in the stay-pattern. Compared with the existing CH algorithms, our algorithm achieves the following advances: i) guaranteed rendezvous without the need of time-synchronization; ii) applicability to rendezvous of multi-user and multi-hop scenarios. We derive the maximum time-to-rendezvous (TTR) and the upper-bound of expected TTR of our algorithm for both 2-user and multi-user scenarios (shown in Table I). Extensive simulations are further conducted to evaluate performance of our algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935066.pdf","startPage":"2444","endPage":"2452","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935066","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935066","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Jump-stay based channel-hopping algorithm with guaranteed rendezvous for cognitive radio networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Indexes","Cognitive radio","Servers","Clocks","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio spectrum management","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["jump-stay based channel-hopping algorithm","guaranteed rendezvous","cognitive radio networks","wireless spectrum","communication links","spectrum management","channel contention","blind rendezvous","common control channel","jump-pattern","stay-pattern","time synchronization","time-to-rendezvous"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","blind rendezvous","channel hopping"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935066/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Jump-stay based channel-hopping algorithm with guaranteed rendezvous for cognitive radio networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935066/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085858","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Jump-stay based channel-hopping algorithm with guaranteed rendezvous for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p2444lin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064615S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935066","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5935067,"authors":[{"name":"Hyoil Kim","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

In the Wi-Fi 2.0 networks, each wireless service provider (WSP) temporarily leases a licensed spectrum band from the licensees and opportunistically utilizes it during the absence of the legacy users. The WSPs in Wi-Fi 2.0 thus face unique challenges since spectrum availability of the leased channel is time-varying due to the ON/OFF spectrum usage patterns of the legacy users, which necessitates the eviction control of in-service customers at the return of legacy users. As a result, to maximize its profit, a WSP should consider both channel leasing and eviction costs to optimally determine a spectrum band to lease and a service tariff. In this paper, we consider a duopoly Wi-Fi 2.0 market where two co-located WSPs compete for the spectrum and customers. The competition between the WSPs is analyzed using game theory to derive the Nash Equilibria (NE) of the price (of the service tariffs) and the quality (of the leased channel, in terms of channel utilization) competitions. The NE existence condition and market entry barriers are also derived. Via an extensive numerical analysis, we show the tradeoffs between leasing/eviction cost, customer arrivals, and channel usage patterns by the legacy users.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935067/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12085859","publicationDate":"April 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935067/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Wi-Fi 2.0: Price and quality competitions of duopoly cognitive radio wireless service providers with time-varying spectrum availability","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wi-Fi 2.0: Price and quality competitions of duopoly cognitive radio wireless service providers with time-varying spectrum availability","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p2453kim.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075679S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5935068,"authors":[{"name":"Cem Tekin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Cem","lastName":"Tekin","id":"38265507300"},{"name":"Mingyan Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Mingyan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37275671500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935068","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":61,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":662},"abstract":"We consider an opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) problem where the time-varying condition of each channel (e.g., as a result of random fading or certain primary users' activities) is modeled as an arbitrary finite-state Markov chain. At each instance of time, a (secondary) user probes a channel and collects a certain reward as a function of the state of the channel (e.g., good channel condition results in higher data rate for the user). Each channel has potentially different state space and statistics, both unknown to the user, who tries to learn which one is the best as it goes and maximizes its usage of the best channel. The objective is to construct a good online learning algorithm so as to minimize the difference between the user's performance in total rewards and that of using the best channel (on average) had it known which one is the best from a priori knowledge of the channel statistics (also known as the regret). This is a classic exploration and exploitation problem and results abound when the reward processes are assumed to be iid. Compared to prior work, the biggest difference is that in our case the reward process is assumed to be Markovian, of which iid is a special case. In addition, the reward processes are restless in that the channel conditions will continue to evolve independent of the user's actions. This leads to a restless bandit problem, for which there exists little result on either algorithms or performance bounds in this learning context to the best of our knowledge. In this paper we introduce an algorithm that utilizes regenerative cycles of a Markov chain and computes a samplemean based index policy, and show that under mild conditions on the state transition probabilities of the Markov chains this algorithm achieves logarithmic regret uniformly over time, and that this regret bound is also optimal. We numerically examine the performance of this algorithm along with a few other learning algorithms in the case of an OSA problem with Gilbert-Elliot channel models, and discuss how this algorithm may be further improved (in terms of its constant) and how this result may lead to similar bounds for other algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935068.pdf","startPage":"2462","endPage":"2470","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935068","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online learning in opportunistic spectrum access: A restless bandit approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Markov processes","Indexes","Silicon","Fading","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Context","Probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided instruction","Internet","radio spectrum management","statistical analysis","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online learning","opportunistic spectrum access","restless bandit approach","time-varying channel","finite-state Markov chain","channel statistics","OSA problem","Gilbert-Elliot channel models"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935068/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Online learning in opportunistic spectrum access: A restless bandit approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935068/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085860","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online learning in opportunistic spectrum access: A restless bandit approach","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p2462tekin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.156913S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935068","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5935069,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Sun","id":"37399238000"},{"name":"Wenye Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Wenye","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280459500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935069","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":473},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935069","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Mobile communication","Mobile computing","Wireless networks","Markov processes","Random variables","Euclidean distance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","mobile radio","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile cognitive radio networks","information dissemination latency","communication infrastructure","licensed users","primary users","cognitive radio users","secondary users","stationary spatial distribution","gamma random variables","transmission hops","Euclidean distance"]}],"doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935069","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935069.pdf","startPage":"246","endPage":"250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On distribution and limits of information dissemination latency and speed in mobile cognitive radio networks","abstract":"Dissemination latency and speed are central to the applications of cognitive radio networks, which have become an important component of current communication infrastructure.

Both protocols achieve better time-to-rendezvous and throughput compared to previous work.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ETCH: Efficient Channel Hopping for communication rendezvous in dynamic spectrum access networks","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935070","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935070.pdf","startPage":"2471","endPage":"2479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935070","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935070/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"ETCH: Efficient Channel Hopping for communication rendezvous in dynamic spectrum access networks","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935070/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085862","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ETCH: Efficient Channel Hopping for communication rendezvous in dynamic spectrum access networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p2471zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062029S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5935075,"authors":[{"name":"Mingyi Hong","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Information Engineering, University of Virginia, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Mingyi","lastName":"Hong","id":"37529088700"},{"name":"Alfredo Garcia","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Information Engineering, University of Virginia, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Alfredo","lastName":"Garcia","id":"37402815900"},{"name":"Jorge Barrera","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Information Engineering, University of Virginia, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Barrera","id":"37706431700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935075","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":712},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Copper","Resource management","Joints","Interference","Switches","Radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","game theory","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint distributed access point selection","power allocation","cognitive radio network","CRN","multiple cognitive user","CU","AP","uplink transmission rate","joint spectrum decision","noncooperative spectrum management game","Nash equilibrium","NE"]}],"abstract":"Spectrum management has been identified as a crucial step towards enabling the technology of the cognitive radio network (CRN). Most of the current works dealing with spectrum management in the CRN focus on a single task of the problem, e.g., spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing or spectrum mobility. In this work, we argue that for certain network configurations, jointly performing several tasks of the spectrum management improves the spectrum efficiency. Specifically, we study the uplink resource management problem in a CRN where there exist multiple cognitive users (CUs) and access points (APs), with each AP operates on a set of non-overlapping channels. The CUs, in order to maximize their uplink transmission rates, have to associate to a suitable AP (spectrum decision), and to share the channels belong to this AP with other CUs (spectrum sharing). These tasks are clearly interdependent, and the problem of how they should be carried out efficiently and distributedly is still open in the literature. In this work we formulate this joint spectrum decision and spectrum sharing problem into a non-cooperative game, in which the feasible strategy of a player contains a discrete variable and a continuous vector. The structure of the game is hence very different from most non-cooperative spectrum management game proposed in the literature. We provide characterization of the Nash Equilibrium (NE) of this game, and present a set of novel algorithms that allow the CUs to distributively and efficiently select the suitable AP and share the channels with other CUs. Finally, we study the properties of the proposed algorithms as well as their performance via extensive simulations.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935075","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935075.pdf","startPage":"2516","endPage":"2524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint distributed access point selection and power allocation in cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935075","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935075/","displayDocTitle":"Joint distributed access point selection and power allocation in cognitive radio networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085867","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935075/","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint distributed access point selection and power allocation in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p2516hong.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.165031S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5935080,"authors":[{"name":"Chee Wei Tan","affiliation":["City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Chee Wei","lastName":"Tan","id":"37309056200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935080","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":878},"abstract":"Heterogeneous wireless networks employ varying degrees of network coverage using power control in a multi-tier configuration, where low-power femtocells are used to enhance performance, e.g., optimize outage probability.

The problem is to find the optimal transmit powers for the base stations, such that VBR video data can be delivered to mobile users without causing playout buffer underflow or overflow. We formulate a nonlinear nonconvex optimization problem and prove the condition for the existence of feasible solutions. We then develop a centralized branch-and-bound algorithm incorporating the Reformulation-Linearization Technique, which can produce (1-\u03b5)-optimal solutions.

The main strength of this methodology lies in its ability to account for the randomness in the nodes' location jointly with an accurate description at the physical layer, based on the SINR, that allows to consider also random fading on each link. Existing models of CSMA networks adopting the stochastic geometry approach suffer from two important weaknesses: 1) they permit to evaluate only spatial averages of the main performance measures, thus hiding possibly huge discrepancies in the performance achieved by individual nodes; 2) they are analytically tractable only when nodes are distributed over the area according to simple spatial processes (e.g., the Poisson point process). In this paper we show how the stochastic geometry approach can be extended to overcome the above limitations, allowing to obtain node throughput distributions as well as to analyze a significant class of topologies in which nodes are not independently placed.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935092","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935092.pdf","startPage":"2642","endPage":"2650","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New insights into the stochastic geometry analysis of dense CSMA networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935092","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935092/","displayDocTitle":"New insights into the stochastic geometry analysis of dense CSMA networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085884","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935092/","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New insights into the stochastic geometry analysis of dense CSMA networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p2642alfano.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100563S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5935099,"authors":[{"name":"Shaolei Ren","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shaolei","lastName":"Ren","id":"37411271000"},{"name":"Jaeok Park","affiliation":["Department of Economics, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jaeok","lastName":"Park","id":"37407054900"},{"name":"Mihaela van der Schaar","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mihaela","lastName":"van der Schaar","id":"37285114700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935099","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":361},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Subscriptions","Monopoly","Cost accounting","Convergence","Games","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","monopoly","telecommunication industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["user subscription dynamics","revenue maximization","network service providers","monopoly communications markets","duopoly communications markets","noncooperative game","Nash equilibrium","market competition game"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935099","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935099","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","abstract":"In order to understand the complex interactions between different technologies in a communications market, it is of fundamental importance to understand how technologies affect the demand of users and competition between network service providers (NSPs). To this end, we analyze user subscription dynamics and revenue maximization in monopoly and duopoly communications markets. First, by considering a monopoly market with only one NSP, we investigate the impact of technologies on the users' dynamic subscription. It is shown that, for any price charged by the NSP, there exists a unique equilibrium point of the considered user subscription dynamics. We also provide a sufficient condition under which the user subscription dynamics converges to the equilibrium point starting from any initial point. We then derive upper and lower bounds on the optimal price and market share that maximize the NSP's revenue. Next, we turn to the analysis of a duopoly market and show that, for any charged prices, the equilibrium point of the considered user subscription dynamics exists and is unique. As in a monopoly market, we derive a sufficient condition on the technologies of the NSPs that ensures the user subscription dynamics to reach the equilibrium point. Then, we model the NSP competition using a non-cooperative game, in which the two NSPs choose their market shares independently, and provide a sufficient condition that guarantees the existence of at least one pure Nash equilibrium in the market competition game.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935099","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","startPage":"2696","endPage":"2704","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935099.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User subscription dynamics and revenue maximization in communications markets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935099/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5935099/","displayDocTitle":"User subscription dynamics and revenue maximization in communications markets","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085891","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User subscription dynamics and revenue maximization in communications markets","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p2696ren.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088817S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935099","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5935100,"authors":[{"name":"Ping Xu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Xu","id":"37395507200"},{"name":"XiaoHua Xu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"XiaoHua","lastName":"Xu","id":"37308492000"},{"name":"ShaoJie Tang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"ShaoJie","lastName":"Tang","id":"37305070700"},{"name":"Xiang-Yang Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Xiang-Yang","lastName":"Li","id":"37280866600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935100","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":719},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Truthful online spectrum allocation and auction in multi-channel wireless networks","abstract":"We propose efficient spectrum channel allocation and auction methods for the online wireless channel scheduling.

Our extensive simulations show that they perform almost optimum: most of our methods can achieve more than 50% of the optimum by offline method.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","startPage":"26","endPage":"30","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935100.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935100","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Resource management","Processor scheduling","Upper bound","Wireless networks","Heuristic algorithms","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","protocols","radio networks","scheduling","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichannel wireless network","truthful online spectrum channel allocation","auction method","online wireless channel scheduling","time interval","protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spectrum","online algorithm","competitive ratio","wireless networks","mechanisms","strategyproof"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Truthful online spectrum allocation and auction in multi-channel wireless networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085892","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5935100/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935100/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Truthful online spectrum allocation and auction in multi-channel wireless networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p26xu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068012S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5935102,"authors":[{"name":"Sha Hua","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, USA"],"firstName":"Sha","lastName":"Hua","id":"37402139100"},{"name":"Hang Liu","affiliation":["Technicolor Corporate Research, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279501300"},{"name":"Mingquan Wu","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Company Limited, Bridgewater, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Mingquan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37067081900"},{"name":"Shivendra S.

However, all existing work on such cooperative cognitive radio networks (CCRNs) operate in the temporal domain. The PU needs to give out a dedicated portion of channel access time to the SUs for transmitting the secondary data in exchange for the SUs' cooperation, which limits the performance of both PUs and SUs. On the other hand, Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) enables transmission of multiple independent data streams and suppression of interference via beam-forming in the spatial domain over MIMO antenna elements to provide significant performance gains. Researches have not yet explored how to take advantage of the MIMO technique in CCRNs. In this paper, we propose a novel MIMO-CCRN framework, which enables the SUs to utilize the capability provided by the MIMO to cooperatively relay the traffic for the PUs while concurrently accessing the same channel to transmit their own traffic. We design the MIMO-CCRN architecture by considering both the temporal and spatial domains to improve spectrum efficiency. Further we provide theoretical analysis for the primary and secondary transmission rate under MIMO cooperation and then formulate an optimization model based on a Stackelberg game to maximize the utilities of PUs and SUs. Evaluation results show that both primary and secondary users achieve higher utility by leveraging MIMO spatial cooperation in MIMO-CCRN than with conventional schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting MIMO antennas in cooperative cognitive radio networks","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935102","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935102.pdf","startPage":"2714","endPage":"2722","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935102","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935102/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting MIMO antennas in cooperative cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935102/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085894","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting MIMO antennas in cooperative cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p2714hua.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082132S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935102","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5935104,"authors":[{"name":"Tengyi Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Tengyi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37592504600"},{"name":"Danny H.

In this paper, we consider the problem of optimal Cooperative Sensing Scheduling (CSS) and parameter design to achieve energy efficiency in CRNs using the framework of Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). In particular, we consider the CSS problem for a CRN with M Secondary Users (SUs) and N primary channels to determine how many SUs should be assigned to sense each channel in order to maximize the objective function that is related to energy efficiency. By assigning more SUs to sense one channel, higher sensing accuracy can be gained; however, by spreading out the SUs to sense more channels, spectrum opportunities can be better exploited. The CSS problem is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem. While such problem is generally hard and can only be solved by numerical methods with high computation complexity, in this paper we provide a detailed analysis and the analytical results provide useful and interesting insights. The optimality of the myopic CSS is proved for the case of two channels, and it is also conjectured for the general case. We also study the tradeoff between the sensing and transmission durations. In addition, the structure of the optimal sensing time that maximizes the energy efficiency objective is also analyzed, the condition for the optimality of the myopic sensing time is obtained, and the performance upper bound of the myopic policy is derived. Based on the numerical results, we show that by carefully tuning a punishment parameter, better energy efficiency can be achieved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935104/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12085896","publicationDate":"April 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935104/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Cooperative Sensing Scheduling for energy-efficient Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Cooperative Sensing Scheduling for energy-efficient Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p2723zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109816S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935104","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5935106,"authors":[{"name":"Chonggang Wang","affiliation":["InterDigital Communication Corporation, King of Prussia, PA, USA","NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Chonggang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280016400"},{"name":"Kazem Sohraby","affiliation":["University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, USA"],"firstName":"Kazem","lastName":"Sohraby","id":"37279992500"},{"name":"Rittwik Jana","affiliation":["AT and T Research Laboratories, Florham Park, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Rittwik","lastName":"Jana","id":"37271233100"},{"name":"Lusheng Ji","affiliation":["AT and T Research Laboratories, Florham Park, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Lusheng","lastName":"Ji","id":"37276515300"},{"name":"Mahmoud Daneshmand","affiliation":["AT and T Research Laboratories, Florham Park, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Daneshmand","id":"37382408400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935106","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":667},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Algorithm design and analysis","Irrigation","Tin","Queueing analysis","Energy measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","Markov processes","probability","radio spectrum management","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","license based wireless communication","spatial spectrum underutilization","temporal spectrum underutilization","Markov queuing model","target collision probability","collision constrained network selection","CCNS method","measurement based networks selection","online measurement"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network selection for secondary users in cognitive radio systems","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","endPage":"2749","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935106.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935106","startPage":"2741","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935106","abstract":"Existing studies have demonstrated that uneven and dynamic usage patterns by the primary users of license-based wireless communication systems can often lead to temporal and spatial spectrum underutilization. This provides an opportunity for the secondary users (SUs) to tap into underutilized frequency bands provided that they are capable of cognitively accessing systems without colliding or impacting the performance of the primary users (PUs). When there are multiple networks with spare spectrum, secondary users can opportunistically choose the best network to access, subject to certain constraints. In cognitive radio systems, this is referred to as the network selection problem for secondary users. This paper develops a Markov queuing model to obtain the maximum allowable arrival rate of secondary users subject to a target collision probability for the primary users. Based on this model, we design a novel Collision-Constrained Network Selection (CCNS) method that maximizes secondary users' throughput subject to a given PU collision probability. Further, we propose two approaches, referred as CCNS-Greedy and CCNS-Energy, which target to reduce collision probability and to decrease energy consumption of secondary users when the system is underloaded. This, however, has one practical drawback in that the proposed CCNS method depends on PU and SU traffic characteristics such as inter-arrival time and service time, which might not be available in real scenario. We next illustrate that a MEAsurement-based Networks Selection (MEANS) scheme can be used to perform network selection for secondary users based on online measurement of PU collision probability of each network. We evaluated the performance based on extensive simulation, which conclusively shows that the proposed schemes achieve the best performance in terms of resulting PU collision probability, SU throughput, and SU energy consumption, when compared to both Random and Greedy strategies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935106/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12085898","htmlLink":"/document/5935106/","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Network selection for secondary users in cognitive radio systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network selection for secondary users in cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p2741wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101656S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935106","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5935108,"authors":[{"name":"Miao Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Miao","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37292301100"},{"name":"Yuanyuan Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yuanyuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37280588900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935108","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":574},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935108","abstract":"In this paper, a three-layer framework is proposed for mobile data collection in wireless sensor networks, which includes the sensor layer, cluster head layer, and mobile collector (called SenCar) layer. The framework employs distributed load balanced clustering and MIMO uploading techniques, which is referred to as LBC-MU. The objective is to achieve good scalability, long network lifetime and low data collection latency. At the sensor layer, a distributed load balanced clustering (LBC) algorithm is proposed for sensors to self-organize themselves into clusters. In contrast to existing clustering methods, our scheme generates multiple cluster heads in each cluster to balance the work load and facilitate MIMO data uploading. At the cluster head layer, the inter-cluster transmission range is carefully chosen to guarantee the connectivity among the clusters. Multiple cluster heads within a cluster cooperate with each other to perform energy-saving inter-cluster communications. Through inter-cluster transmissions, cluster head information is forwarded to the SenCar for its moving trajectory planning. At the mobile collector layer, the SenCar is equipped with two antennas, which enables multiple cluster heads to simultaneously upload data to the SenCar. The trajectory planning for the SenCar is optimized to fully utilize MIMO uploading capability by properly selecting polling points in each cluster. By visiting each selected polling point, the SenCar can efficiently gather data from cluster heads and transport the data to the static data sink. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed LBC-MU scheme. The results show that when each cluster has at most two cluster heads, LBC-MU can reduce the maximum number of transmissions a sensor performs by 90% and the average number of transmissions by 88% compared with the enhanced relay routing scheme. It also results in 25% shorter average data latency compared with the mobile collection scheme with single-head clustering.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935108","startPage":"2759","endPage":"2767","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935108.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A framework for mobile data gathering with load balanced clustering and MIMO uploading","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","MIMO","Clustering algorithms","Relays","Peer to peer computing","Trajectory","Scalability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","pattern clustering","resource allocation","telecommunication network planning","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication network routing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile data gathering framework","load balanced clustering","mobile data collection","wireless sensor networks","sensor layer","cluster head layer","mobile collector layer","MIMO uploading techniques","distributed load balanced clustering algorithm","network lifetime","low data collection latency","multiple cluster heads","energy-saving intercluster communications","cluster head information","SenCar","moving trajectory planning","antennas","polling points","static data sink","LBC-MU scheme","enhanced relay routing scheme","single-head clustering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935108/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"A framework for mobile data gathering with load balanced clustering and MIMO uploading","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935108/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085900","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A framework for mobile data gathering with load balanced clustering and MIMO uploading","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p2759zhao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107472S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5935115,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmoud Al-Ayyoub","affiliation":["Stony Brook University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Al-Ayyoub","id":"38271803700"},{"name":"Himanshu Gupta","affiliation":["Stony Brook University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Himanshu","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37270217000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935115","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":60,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":428},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Base stations","Cost accounting","Interference","Bayesian methods","Approximation methods","Color"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["truthful spectrum auctions","approximate revenue","cellular networks","auction-based market mechanism","efficient auction mechanism","dynamic spectrum access model","revenue maximization","polynomial-time spectrum auction mechanism"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935115","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935115","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","abstract":"In cellular networks, a recent trend is to make spectrum access dynamic in the spatial and temporal dimensions, for the sake of efficient utilization of spectrum. In such a model, the spectrum is divided into channels and periodically allocated to competing base stations using an auction-based market mechanism. An \u201cefficient\u201d auction mechanism is essential to the success of such a dynamic spectrum access model. Two of the key objectives in designing an auction mechanism are \u201ctruthfulness\u201d and revenue maximization. In this article, we design a polynomial-time spectrum auction mechanism that is truthful and yields an allocation with O(1)-approximate expected revenue, in the Bayesian setting.

A substantial body of work has been carried out to improve the capacity of cellular networks by introducing ad hoc communications, resulting in the so-called multihop cellular networks. Most of the previous research allows ad hoc transmissions between certain source and destination pairs to alleviate base stations' relay burden. However, since reports show that Internet data traffic is becoming more and more dominant in cellular networks, we explore in this paper the capacity of multihop cellular networks with all traffic going through base stations and ad hoc transmissions only acting as relay. We first investigate the capacity of regular multihop cellular networks where both nodes and base stations are regularly placed. By fully exploiting the link rate variability, we find that multihop cellular networks can have higher per-node throughput than traditional cellular networks by a scaling factor of log\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\nn.

Management of CDNs requires algorithms for request routing, content placement, and eviction in such a way that user delays are small. We abstract the system of frontend source nodes and backend caches of the CDN in the likeness of the input and output nodes of a switch. In this model, queues of requests for different pieces of content build up at the source nodes, which route these requests to a cache that contains the requested content. For each request that is routed to a cache, a corresponding data file is transmitted back to the requesting source across links of finite capacity. Caches are of finite size, and the content of the caches can be refreshed periodically. Our objective is to design policies for request routing, content placement and content eviction with the goal of small user delays. Stable policies ensure the finiteness of the request queues, while good polices also lead to short queue lengths. We first design a throughput-optimal algorithm that solves the routing-placement-eviction problem. The design yields insight into the impact of different cache refresh policies on queue length, and we construct throughput optimal algorithms that engender short queue lengths. We illustrate the potential of our approach through simulations on different CDN topologies.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935123","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935123.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","startPage":"2858","endPage":"2866","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Content-aware caching and traffic management in content distribution networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935123","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Content-aware caching and traffic management in content distribution networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935123/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085913","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5935123/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Content-aware caching and traffic management in content distribution networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p2858amble.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063196S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935123","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5935127,"authors":[{"name":"Hyungsoo Jung","affiliation":["School of Information Technologies, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Hyungsoo","lastName":"Jung","id":"37310319800"},{"name":"Shin-gyu Kim","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Shin-gyu","lastName":"Kim","id":"37309965300"},{"name":"Heon Y.

This paper presents ACP, an Adaptive end-to-end Congestion control Protocol that achieves the above goals in high bandwidth-delay product networks where TCP becomes inefficient. The main contribution of ACP is a new form of congestion window control, combining the estimation of the bottleneck queue size and a measure of fair sharing. Specifically, upon detecting congestion, ACP decreases the congestion window size by the exact amount required to empty the bottleneck queue while maintaining high utilization, while the increases of the congestion window are based on a \u201cfairness ratio\u201d metric of each flow, which ensures fast convergence to a fair equilibrium. We demonstrate the benefits of ACP using both ns-2 simulation and experimental measurements of a Linux prototype implementation. In particular, we show that the new protocol is TCP-friendly and allows TCP and ACP flows to coexist in various circumstances, and that ACP indeed behaves more fairly than other TCP variants under heterogeneous round-trip times (RTT).","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935127","startPage":"2885","endPage":"2893","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935127.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive delay-based congestion control for high bandwidth-delay product networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive delay-based congestion control for high bandwidth-delay product networks","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935127/","accessionNumber":"12085917","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935127/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive delay-based congestion control for high bandwidth-delay product networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p2885jung.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070013S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935127","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5935140,"authors":[{"name":"Dongyue Xue","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, USA"],"firstName":"Dongyue","lastName":"Xue","id":"37722173400"},{"name":"Eylem Ekici","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, USA"],"firstName":"Eylem","lastName":"Ekici","id":"37265480800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935140","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":505},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Throughput","Manganese"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio networks","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["guaranteed opportunistic scheduling","multihop cognitive radio networks","opportunistic sharing","bandwidth sharing","spectrum sharing","optimal control","scheduling algorithm","collision rate constraints","fixed-routing scenario","lower bound"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radio networks enable opportunistic sharing of bandwidth/spectrum.

While most existing work focuses on enabling such opportunistic spectrum access for stationary CRs, mobility is an important concern to secondary users (SUs) because future mobile devices are expected to incorporate CR functionality. In this paper, we identify and address three fundamental challenges encountered specifically by mobile SUs. First, we model channel availability experienced by a mobile SU as a two-state continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) and verify its accuracy via in-depth simulation. Then, to protect primary/incumbent communications from SU interference, we introduce guard distance in the space domain and derive the optimal guard distance that maximizes the spatio-temporal spectrum opportunities available to mobile CRs. To facilitate efficient spectrum sharing, we formulate the problem of maximizing secondary network throughput within a convex optimization framework, and derive an optimal, distributed channel selection strategy. Our simulation results show that the proposed spectrum sensing and distributed channel access schemes improve network throughput and fairness significantly, and reduce SU energy consumption for spectrum sensing by up to 74%.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935141","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935141.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935141","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","startPage":"2993","endPage":"3001","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic spectrum access for mobile cognitive radios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935141","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic spectrum access for mobile cognitive radios","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935141/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935141/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085931","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic spectrum access for mobile cognitive radios","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p2993min.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08588S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935141","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5935142,"authors":[{"name":"Karim Khalil","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Karim","lastName":"Khalil","id":"37703681000"},{"name":"Mehmet Karaca","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mehmet","lastName":"Karaca","id":"37658727300"},{"name":"Ozgur Ercetin","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ozgur","lastName":"Ercetin","id":"37295220300"},{"name":"Eylem Ekici","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Eylem","lastName":"Ekici","id":"37265480800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935142","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":433},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimal scheduling","Cognitive radio","Base stations","Schedules","Relays","Scheduling algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","Lyapunov methods","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal scheduling","cooperate-to-join cognitive radio networks","optimal transmission scheduling","wireless cognitive networks","spectrum leasing model","noncooperative scheduling schemes","Lyapunov optimization techniques"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal scheduling in cooperate-to-join Cognitive Radio Networks","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","endPage":"3010","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935142.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935142","startPage":"3002","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935142","abstract":"Optimal transmission scheduling in wireless cognitive networks is considered under the spectrum leasing model.

Based on Lyapunov Optimization techniques, we show that our schemes are arbitrarily close to the optimal performance at the price of reduced convergence rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935142/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12085932","htmlLink":"/document/5935142/","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimal scheduling in cooperate-to-join Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal scheduling in cooperate-to-join Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p3002khalil.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079436S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5935143,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Song","id":"37407137900"},{"name":"Jiang Xie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA"],"firstName":"Jiang","lastName":"Xie","id":"37279378300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935143","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":42,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":988},"abstract":"Cognitive radio (CR) technology is regarded as a promising solution to the spectrum scarcity problem. Due to the spectrum varying nature of CR networks, unlicensed users are required to perform spectrum handoffs when licensed users reuse the spectrum. In this paper, we study the performance of the spectrum handoff process in a CR ad hoc network under homogeneous primary traffic. We propose a novel three dimensional discrete-time Markov chain to characterize the process of spectrum handoffs and analyze the performance of unlicensed users. Since in real CR networks, a dedicated common control channel is not practical, in our model, we implement a network coordination scheme where no dedicated common control channel is needed. Moreover, in wireless communications, collisions among simultaneous transmissions cannot be immediately detected and the whole collided packets need to be retransmitted, which greatly affects the network performance. With this observation, we also consider the retransmissions of the collided packets in our proposed discrete-time Markov chain. In addition, besides the random channel selection scheme, we study the impact of different channel selection schemes on the performance of the spectrum handoff process. Furthermore, we also consider the spectrum sensing delay in our proposed Markov model and investigate its effect on the network performance. We validate the numerical results obtained from our proposed Markov model against simulation and investigate other parameters of interest in the spectrum handoff scenario. Our proposed analytical model can be applied to various practical network scenarios. It also provides new insights on the process of spectrum handoffs. Currently, no existing analysis has considered the comprehensive aspects of spectrum handoff as what we consider in this paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935143.pdf","startPage":"3011","endPage":"3019","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of spectrum handoff for cognitive radio ad hoc networks without common control channel under homogeneous primary traffic","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","Markov processes","radio spectrum management","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","spectrum handoff","cognitive radio ad hoc networks","common control channel","homogeneous primary traffic","unlicensed users","spectrum reuse","3D discrete-time Markov chain","collided packets","random channel selection scheme"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935143/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of spectrum handoff for cognitive radio ad hoc networks without common control channel under homogeneous primary traffic","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935143/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085933","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of spectrum handoff for cognitive radio ad hoc networks without common control channel under homogeneous primary traffic","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p3011song.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048853S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5935145,"authors":[{"name":"Ajay Gopinathan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Calgary"],"firstName":"Ajay","lastName":"Gopinathan","id":"37573467000"},{"name":"Zongpeng Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Calgary"],"firstName":"Zongpeng","lastName":"Li","id":"37309823800"},{"name":"Chuan Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Chuan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37308270500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935145","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":71,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":680},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Channel allocation","Random variables","Cost accounting","Algorithm design and analysis","Approximation algorithms","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","channel allocation","communication complexity","interference (signal)","linear programming","minimax techniques","probability","radio networks","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["strategyproof auction","social welfare balancing","secondary spectrum access","spectrum scarcity mitigation","wireless network","coordinated spectrum access","periodic spectrum auction","auction design","social welfare maximization","local fairness criteria","global fairness criteria","probability","interference-free spectrum allocation","NP-hard","approximate solution","payment scheme","truthful bidding","max-min fairness criterion","linear programming technique","channel allocation","primal linear program","dual linear program"]}],"abstract":"Secondary spectrum access is emerging as a promising approach for mitigating the spectrum scarcity in wireless networks. Coordinated spectrum access for secondary users can be achieved using periodic spectrum auctions. Recent studies on such auction design mostly neglect the repeating nature of such auctions, and focus on greedily maximizing social welfare. Such auctions can cause subsets of users to experience starvation in the long run, reducing their incentive to continue participating in the auction. It is desirable to increase the diversity of users allocated spectrum in each auction round, so that a trade-off between social welfare and fairness is maintained. We study truthful mechanisms towards this objective, for both local and global fairness criteria. For local fairness, we introduce randomization into the auction design, such that each user is guaranteed a minimum probability of being assigned spectrum. Computing an optimal, interference-free spectrum allocation is NP-Hard; we present an approximate solution, and tailor a payment scheme to guarantee truthful bidding is a dominant strategy for all secondary users. For global fairness, we adopt the classic max-min fairness criterion. We tailor another auction by applying linear programming techniques for striking the balance between social welfare and max-min fairness, and for finding feasible channel allocations. In particular, a pair of primal and dual linear programs are utilized to guide the probabilistic selection of feasible allocations towards a desired tradeoff in expectation.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935145","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935145.pdf","startPage":"3020","endPage":"3028","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Strategyproof auctions for balancing social welfare and fairness in secondary spectrum markets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935145","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935145/","displayDocTitle":"Strategyproof auctions for balancing social welfare and fairness in secondary spectrum markets","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085935","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935145/","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Strategyproof auctions for balancing social welfare and fairness in secondary spectrum markets","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p3020gopinathan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080181S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5935147,"authors":[{"name":"Qinghe Du","affiliation":["Networking and Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Qinghe","lastName":"Du","id":"37304174500"},{"name":"Xi Zhang","affiliation":["Networking and Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279333400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935147","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":323},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Quality of service","Mobile communication","Wireless communication","Fading","Servers","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","quality of service","radio links","radio networks","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["base-station selection","QoS provisioning","distributed multiuser MIMO link","wireless networks","resource allocation","downlink multiuser transmission","distributed multiple-input-multiple-output link","central server","statistical delay-QoS requirement","delay-bound violation probability","wireless resource-allocation algorithm","joint block-diagonalization","probabilistic transmission","time division multiple access","distributed MIMO transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed MIMO","broadband wireless networks","statistical QoS provisioning","wireless fading channels"]}],"abstract":"We propose the QoS-aware BS-selection and the corresponding resource-allocation schemes for downlink multi-user transmissions over the distributed multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) links, where multiple location-independent base-stations (BS), controlled by a central server, cooperatively transmit data to multiple mobile users. Our proposed schemes aim at minimizing the BS usages and reducing the interfering range of the distributed MIMO transmissions, while satisfying diverse statistical delay-QoS requirements for all users, which are characterized by the delay-bound violation probability and the effective capacity technique. Specifically, we propose two BS-usage minimization frameworks to develop the QoS-aware BS-selection schemes and the corresponding wireless resource-allocation algorithms across multiple mobile users.

We then derive the optimal BS-selection schemes for these two frameworks, respectively. In addition, we further discuss the PT-only based BS-selection scheme.

Our focus is on the network outage from the perspective of signal distortion across all receivers, for both cases where the transmitter may or may not be capable of reconstructing the compressively sampled signals. Capitalizing on extreme value theory, we characterize the network outage in terms of key system parameters, including the erasure probability, the number of receivers and the sparse structure of the signal. We show that when the transmitter can reconstruct the compressively sensed signal, the strategy of using network coding to multicast the reconstructed signal coefficients can reduce the network outage significantly. We observe, however, that the traditional network coding could result in suboptimal performance with power-law decay signals. Thus motivated, we devise a new method, namely subblock network coding, which involves fragmenting the data into subblocks, and allocating time slots to different subblocks, based on its priority. We formulate the corresponding optimal allocation as an integer programming problem. Since integer programming is often intractable, we develop a heuristic algorithm that prioritizes the time slot allocation by exploiting the inherent priority structure of power-law decay signals. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes outperform the traditional methods with significant margins.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Network coding","Compressed sensing","Wireless sensor networks","Wireless communication","Redundancy","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer programming","network coding","signal reconstruction","signal sampling","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sampling","outage analysis","subblock network coding","wireless channels","signal distortion","signal reconstruction","erasure probability","power-law decay signals","integer programming problem","heuristic algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935148","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935148.pdf","startPage":"3047","endPage":"3055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"When compressive sampling meets multicast: Outage analysis and subblock network coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935148","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"When compressive sampling meets multicast: Outage analysis and subblock network coding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935148/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935148/","accessionNumber":"12085938","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"When compressive sampling meets multicast: Outage analysis and subblock network coding","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p3047thejaswips.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060294S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935148","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":5935152,"authors":[{"name":"Hyunseok Chang","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, USA"],"firstName":"Hyunseok","lastName":"Chang","id":"37280773300"},{"name":"Murali Kodialam","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, USA"],"firstName":"Murali","lastName":"Kodialam","id":"37272316500"},{"name":"Ramana Rao Kompella","affiliation":["Purdue University, USA"],"firstName":"Ramana Rao","lastName":"Kompella","id":"37299687000"},{"name":"T.

MapReduce has emerged as an important programming model for these environments. Since today's data centers run many MapReduce jobs in parallel, it is important to find a good scheduling algorithm that can optimize the completion times of these jobs. While several recent papers focused on optimizing the scheduler, there exists very little theoretical understanding of the scheduling problem in the context of MapReduce. In this paper, we seek to address this problem by first presenting a simplified abstraction of the MapReduce scheduling problem, and then formulate the scheduling problem as an optimization problem.We devise various online and offline algorithms to arrive at a good ordering of jobs to minimize the overall job completion times. Since optimal solutions are hard to compute (NP-hard), we propose approximation algorithms that work within a factor of 3 of the optimal. Using simulations, we also compare our online algorithm with standard scheduling strategies such as FIFO, Shortest Job First and show that our algorithm consistently outperforms these across different job distributions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935152.pdf","startPage":"3074","endPage":"3082","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935152","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scheduling in mapreduce-like systems for fast completion time","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Program processors","Approximation algorithms","Optimal scheduling","Processor scheduling","Equations","Approximation methods","Optimized production technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","optimisation","parallel processing","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MapReduce-like systems","fast completion time","distributed computing","parallel computing","data centers","programming model","scheduling algorithm","MapReduce scheduling problem","optimization problem","NP-hard","approximation algorithm","standard scheduling strategies"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935152/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling in mapreduce-like systems for fast completion time","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935152/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085942","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling in mapreduce-like systems for fast completion time","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p3074chang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070185S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935152","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5935154,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Xi''an Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37715395000"},{"name":"Jinsong Han","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Xi''an Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Jinsong","lastName":"Han","id":"37290381600"},{"name":"Yong Qi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Xi''an Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Qi","id":"37558740000"},{"name":"Cheng Wang","affiliation":["University of Tongji, China"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37310514000"},{"name":"Tao Gu","affiliation":["University of Southern Denmark, Denmark"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Gu","id":"37708327600"},{"name":"Yunhao Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, HKUST, Hong Kong, China","TNLIST, School of Software, Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Yunhao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279413400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935154","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":82,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":613},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiofrequency identification","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shelving interference","joint identification","RFID systems","radio frequency identification systems","anticollision","scheduling process","collision resolution","cross-tag-collision"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RFID","Tag Collision","Reader Collision","Season"]}],"abstract":"Prior work on anti-collision for Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) systems usually schedule adjacent readers to exclusively interrogate tags for avoiding reader collisions. Although such a pattern can effectively deal with collisions, the lack of readers' collaboration wastes numerous time on the scheduling process and dramatically degrades the throughput of identification. Even worse, the tags within the overlapped interrogation regions of adjacent readers (termed as contentious tags), even if the number of such tags is very small, introduce a significant delay to the identification process. In this paper, we propose a new strategy for collision resolution. First, we shelve the collisions and identify the tags that do not involve reader collisions. Second, we perform a joint identification, in which adjacent readers collaboratively identify the contentious tags. In particular, we find that neighboring readers can cause a new type of collisions, cross-tag-collision, which may impede the joint identification. We propose a protocol stack, named Season, to undertake the tasks in two phases and solve the cross-tag-collision. We conduct extensive simulations and preliminary implementation to demonstrate the efficiency of our scheme. The results show that our scheme can achieve above 6 times improvement on the identification throughput in a large-scale dense reader environment.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935154","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935154.pdf","startPage":"3092","endPage":"3100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Season: Shelving interference and joint identification in large-scale RFID systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935154","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935154/","displayDocTitle":"Season: Shelving interference and joint identification in large-scale RFID systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085944","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935154/","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Season: Shelving interference and joint identification in large-scale RFID systems","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p3092yang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080041S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935154","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5935155,"authors":[{"name":"Shigang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer & Information Science & Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Shigang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277597200"},{"name":"Ming Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer & Information Science & Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37406632000"},{"name":"Bin Xiao","affiliation":["Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37266663200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935155","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":93,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":711},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935155","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Radiofrequency identification","Silicon carbide","Microwave integrated circuits","Temperature sensors","Batteries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","inventory management","protocols","radiofrequency identification","warehouse automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensor-augmented RFID networks","warehouse management","inventory management","single-hash information collection protocol","multi-hash information collection protocol"]}],"doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935155","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935155.pdf","startPage":"3101","endPage":"3109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient information collection protocols for sensor-augmented RFID networks","abstract":"Similar to the revolutionary change that the barcode system brought to the retail industry, the RFID technologies are expected to revolutionize the warehouse and inventory management. After RFID tags are deployed to make the attached objects wirelessly identifiable, a natural next step is to invent new ways to benefit from this \u201cinfrastructure\u201d. For example, sensors may be added to these tags to gather real-time information about the state of the objects or about the environment where these objects reside. This leads to the problem of designing efficient protocols to collect such information from the tags. It is a new problem that the existing work cannot solve well. In this paper, we first show that a straightforward polling solution will not be efficient. We then propose a single-hash information collection protocol that works much better than the polling solution. However, a wide gap still exists between the execution time of this protocol and a lower bound that we establish. Finally, we propose a multi-hash information collection protocol that further reduces the expected execution time to within 1.61 times the lower bound.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935155/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12085945","publicationDate":"April 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935155/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Efficient information collection protocols for sensor-augmented RFID networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient information collection protocols for sensor-augmented RFID networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p3101chen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068135S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935155","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5935157,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Gao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Gao","id":"37307925500"},{"name":"Guohong Cao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Guohong","lastName":"Cao","id":"37273327300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935157","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":125,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1023},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Data models","Time factors","Probabilistic logic","Maintenance engineering","Measurement","Exponential distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["user-centric data dissemination","disruption tolerant networks","DTN","data dissemination schemes","network-centric","user interests","cost-effectiveness","social centrality metric","social contact patterns","mobile users","relay selection","formal analysis","trace-driven simulations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935157","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935157","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","abstract":"Data dissemination is useful for many applications of Disruption Tolerant Networks (DTNs).

Our approach is based on a social centrality metric, which considers the social contact patterns and interests of mobile users simultaneously, and thus ensures effective relay selection. The performance of our approach is evaluated from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. By formal analysis, we show the lower bound on the cost-effectiveness of data dissemination, and analytically investigate the tradeoff between the effectiveness of relay selection and the overhead of maintaining network information.

An \u201corganic\u201d RF positioning system relies on regular users, not dedicated surveyors, to build the map of RF fingerprints to location labels. However, signal variation due to device heterogeneity may degrade localization performance. We analyze the diversity of those signal characteristics pertinent to indoor localization - signal strength and AP detection - as measured by a variety of 802.11 devices. We first analyze signal strength diversity, and show that pairwise linear transformation alone does not solve the problem. We propose kernel estimation with a wide kernel width to reduce the difference in probability estimates. We also investigate diversity in access point detection. We demonstrate that localization performance may degrade significantly when AP detection rate is used as a feature for localization, and correlate the loss of performance to a device dissimilarity measure captured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. Based on this analysis, we show that using only signal strength, without incorporating negative evidence, achieves good localization performance when devices are heterogeneous.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implications of device diversity for organic localization","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935166","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935166.pdf","startPage":"3182","endPage":"3190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935166","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935166","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935166/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Implications of device diversity for organic localization","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935166/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085956","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implications of device diversity for organic localization","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p3182park.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058043S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935166","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5935173,"authors":[{"name":"Lu Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37089062069"},{"name":"Xueyan Tang","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xueyan","lastName":"Tang","id":"37280010700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935173","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Heuristic algorithms","Polynomials","Computer architecture","Games","Partitioning algorithms","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["client-server systems","graph theory","greedy algorithms","interactive systems","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed interactive application","networked system","large-scale DIA","distributed server architecture","network latency","client assignment problem","combinational optimization problem","graph theory","NP-complete problem","greedy algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935173","abstract":"Distributed Interactive Applications (DIAs) are networked systems that allow multiple participants to interact with one another in real time.

In the distributed server architecture, how the clients are assigned to the servers directly affects the network latency involved in the interactions between clients. This paper focuses on the client assignment problem for enhancing the interactivity performance of DIAs. We formulate the problem as a combinational optimization problem on graphs and prove that it is NP-complete. Several heuristic algorithms are proposed for fast computation of good client assignments and are experimentally evaluated. The experimental results show that the proposed greedy algorithms perform close to the optimal assignment and generally outperform the Nearest-Assignment algorithm that assigns each client to its nearest server.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935173","startPage":"3227","endPage":"3235","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935173.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Client assignment for improving interactivity in distributed interactive applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935173/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Client assignment for improving interactivity in distributed interactive applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935173/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12085963","publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Client assignment for improving interactivity in distributed interactive applications","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p3227zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0504S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935173","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5935181,"authors":[{"name":"Wen Luo","affiliation":["Department of Computer & Information Science & Engineering, University of Florida, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Luo","id":"37710625700"},{"name":"Shigang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer & Information Science & Engineering, University of Florida, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Shigang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277597200"},{"name":"Tao Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer & Information Science & Engineering, University of Florida, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Li","id":"37539272900"},{"name":"Shiping Chen","affiliation":["Network Information Center, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Shiping","lastName":"Chen","id":"37535881400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935181","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":52,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":582},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","RFID tags","Batteries","Estimation","Inventory management","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiofrequency identification","storage automation","warehouse automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["missing tag detection","RFID systems","RFID tags","automated warehouse management"]}],"abstract":"RFID tags have many important applications in automated warehouse management. One example is to monitor a set of tags and detect whether some tags are missing - the objects to which the missing tags are attached are likely to be missing, too, due to theft or administrative error.

This paper makes several new advances. First, we observe that the existing protocol is far from being optimal in terms of execution time. We are able to cut the execution time to a fraction of what is currently needed. Second, we study the missing-tag detection problem from a new energy perspective, which is very important when battery-powered active tags are used. The new insight provides flexibility for the practitioners to meet their energy and time requirements.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935181","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935181.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935181","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","startPage":"356","endPage":"360","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient missing tag detection in RFID systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935181","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Efficient missing tag detection in RFID systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935181/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935181/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085971","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient missing tag detection in RFID systems","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p356luo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092726S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935181","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5935184,"authors":[{"name":"Shaxun Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shaxun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37535873200"},{"name":"Kai Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37285934000"},{"name":"Prasant Mohapatra","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Prasant","lastName":"Mohapatra","id":"37283726400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935184","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":600},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microphones","Variable speed drives","Transmitters","Microwave integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","microphones","mobile radio","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile primary user emulation attack detection","white space","cognitive radio network","TV tower","wireless microphone","PUE attack detection","transmission power","RF signal","acoustic information"]}],"abstract":"In cognitive radio networks, an adversary transmits signals whose characteristics emulate those of primary users, in order to prevent secondary users from transmitting. Such an attack is called primary user emulation (PUE) attack. There are two main types of primary users in white space: TV towers and wireless microphones. Existing work on PUE attack detection focused on the first category. However, for the latter category, primary users are mobile and their transmission power is low. These unique properties of wireless microphones introduce great challenges and existing methods are not applicable. In this paper, we propose a novel method to detect the PUE attack of mobile primary users.

We view network coding as a spectrum shaper, in the sense that it increases spectrum availability to secondary users (SUs) and offers more structure of spectrum holes, which in turn improves the predictability of the primary spectrum. With this spectrum shaping effect of network coding, each SU can carry out adaptive channel sensing by dynamically updating the list of the (predicted) idle PU channels and giving priority to these channels for spectrum sensing. This dynamic spectrum access approach with network coding improves how SUs detect and utilize spectrum holes over PU channels. Our results show that compared to the existing approaches based on retransmission, both PUs and SUs can achieve higher stable throughput, thanks to the spectrum shaping effect of network coding.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935190/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12085980","htmlLink":"/document/5935190/","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum shaping via network coding in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum shaping via network coding in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p396wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056197S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935190","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5935196,"authors":[{"name":"Di Niu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Di","lastName":"Niu","id":"37409788400"},{"name":"Zimu Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Zimu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37307346400"},{"name":"Baochun Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Baochun","lastName":"Li","id":"37280003300"},{"name":"Shuqiao Zhao","affiliation":["Multimedia Development Group, UUSee, Inc., UK"],"firstName":"Shuqiao","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37311561200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935196","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":82,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":779},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Bandwidth","Streaming media","Predictive models","Internet","Peer to peer computing","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","peer-to-peer computing","quality control","time series","video on demand","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance prediction","peer-assisted on-demand video streaming service","distributed system","automated demand forecasting","capacity planning","quality control","server bandwidth","video channel","time-series analysis technique","online population prediction","online measurement","Internet video-on-demand system"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Demand forecast and performance prediction in peer-assisted on-demand streaming systems","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","endPage":"425","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935196.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935196","startPage":"421","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935196","abstract":"Peer-assisted on-demand video streaming services are extremely large-scale distributed systems on the Internet.

Deploying supporting infrastructure could relieve this problem, but it often requires a large amount of investment and elaborate design, especially at the city scale. In this paper, we propose the idea of Parked Vehicle Assistance (PVA), which allows parked vehicles to join VANETs as static nodes. With wireless device and rechargable battery, parked vehicles can easily communicate with one another and their moving counterparts. Owing to the extensive parking in cities, parked vehicles are natural roadside nodes characterized by large number, long-time staying, wide distribution, and specific location. So parked vehicles can serve as static backbone and service infrastructure to improve connectivity. We investigate network connectivity in PVA through theoretic analysis and realistic survey and simulations. The results prove that even a small proportion of PVA vehicles could overcome sparse or unbalanced traffic, and promote network connectivity greatly. Thus, PVA enhances VANETs from down to top, and paves the way for new hybrid networks with static and mobile nodes.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935198","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935198.pdf","startPage":"431","endPage":"435","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PVA in VANETs: Stopped cars are not silent","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935198","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935198/","displayDocTitle":"PVA in VANETs: Stopped cars are not silent","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085988","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935198/","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PVA in VANETs: Stopped cars are not silent","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p431liu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050442S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935198","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5935199,"authors":[{"name":"Emmanuel Baccelli","affiliation":["INRIA, France"],"firstName":"Emmanuel","lastName":"Baccelli","id":"37421853400"},{"name":"Philippe Jacquet","affiliation":["INRIA, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Jacquet","id":"37283313400"},{"name":"Bernard Mans","affiliation":["Macquarie University, Australia"],"firstName":"Bernard","lastName":"Mans","id":"37299604200"},{"name":"Georgios Rodolakis","affiliation":["Macquarie University, Australia"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Rodolakis","id":"37320742900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935199","dbTime":"42 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":449},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Roads","Delay","Analytical models","Bridges","Ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["roads","vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information propagation speed","bidirectional vehicular delay tolerant networks","highways","moving cars","sublinear power law"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935199","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935199","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","abstract":"In this paper, we provide an analysis of the information propagation speed in bidirectional vehicular delay tolerant networks on highways. We show that a phase transition occurs concerning the information propagation speed, with respect to the vehicle densities in each direction of the highway. We prove that under a certain threshold, information propagates on average at vehicle speed, while above this threshold, information propagates dramatically faster at a speed that increase exponentially when vehicle density increases. We provide the exact expressions of the threshold and of the average propagation speed near the threshold. We show that under the threshold, the information propagates on a distance which is bounded by a sub-linear power law with respect to the elapsed time, in the referential of the moving cars. On the other hand, we show that information propagation speed grows quasi-exponentially with respect to vehicle densities in each direction of the highway, when the densities become large, above the threshold. We confirm our analytical results using simulations carried out in several environments.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","startPage":"436","endPage":"440","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935199.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information propagation speed in bidirectional vehicular delay tolerant networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935199/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5935199/","displayDocTitle":"Information propagation speed in bidirectional vehicular delay tolerant networks","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085989","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information propagation speed in bidirectional vehicular delay tolerant networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p436baccelli.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054554S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5935203,"authors":[{"name":"Omur Ozel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Omur","lastName":"Ozel","id":"37400338000"},{"name":"Kaya Tutuncuoglu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Kaya","lastName":"Tutuncuoglu","id":"37713096100"},{"name":"Jing Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Yang","id":"37406100800"},{"name":"Sennur Ulukus","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Sennur","lastName":"Ulukus","id":"37273214000"},{"name":"Aylin Yener","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Aylin","lastName":"Yener","id":"37273211500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935203","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1562},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Batteries","Transmitters","Energy harvesting","Wireless communication","Resource management","Minimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy harvesting","fading channels","minimisation","radio transmitters","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource management","energy harvesting node","wireless system","rechargeable node","harvested energy arrival","optimization","energy harvesting transmitter","limited battery capacity","wireless fading channel","optimal offline transmission policy","communication session","directional water-filling algorithm","energy storage capacity","throughput maximization problem","channel variation","transmission completion time minimization"]}],"abstract":"Wireless systems comprised of rechargeable nodes have a significantly prolonged lifetime and are sustainable. A distinct characteristic of these systems is the fact that the nodes can harvest energy throughout the duration in which communication takes place. As such, transmission policies of the nodes need to adapt to these harvested energy arrivals. In this paper, we consider optimization of the transmission policy of an energy harvesting transmitter which has a limited battery capacity, communicating in a wireless fading channel. In particular, we identify the optimal offline transmission policies that maximize the number of bits delivered by a deadline, and minimize the transmission completion time of the communication session. We introduce a directional water-filling algorithm which provides a simple and concise interpretation of the necessary optimality conditions as well as energy storage capacity and causality. We solve the throughput maximization problem for the fading channel using the directional water-filling algorithm, which simultaneously adapts to the energy harvested as well as the channel variations in time. We then solve the transmission completion time minimization problem by utilizing its equivalence to its throughput maximization counterpart.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935203","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935203.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935203","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","startPage":"456","endPage":"460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource management for fading wireless channels with energy harvesting nodes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935203","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Resource management for fading wireless channels with energy harvesting nodes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935203/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935203/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085993","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource management for fading wireless channels with energy harvesting nodes","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p456ozel.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070697S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935203","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5935204,"authors":[{"name":"Miao He","affiliation":["School of ECEE, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Miao","lastName":"He","id":"37593532700"},{"name":"Sugumar Murugesan","affiliation":["School of ECEE, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Sugumar","lastName":"Murugesan","id":"37718694300"},{"name":"Junshan Zhang","affiliation":["School of ECEE, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Junshan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37281464300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935204","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":91,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1883},"abstract":"Integrating volatile renewable energy resources into the bulk power grid is challenging, due to the reliability requirement that the load and generation in the system remain balanced all the time. In this study, we tackle this challenge for smart grid with integrated wind generation, by leveraging multi-timescale dispatch and scheduling. Specifically, we consider smart grids with two classes of energy users - traditional energy users and opportunistic energy users (e.g., smart meters or smart appliances), and investigate pricing and dispatch at two timescales, via day-ahead scheduling and real-time scheduling. In day-ahead scheduling, with the statistical information on wind generation and energy demands, we characterize the optimal procurement of the energy supply and the day-ahead retail price for the traditional energy users; in real-time scheduling, with the realization of wind generation and the load of traditional energy users, we optimize real-time prices to manage the opportunistic energy users so as to achieve system-wide reliability. More specifically, when the opportunistic users are non-persistent, we obtain closed-form solutions to the two-level scheduling problem. For the persistent case, we treat the scheduling problem as a multi-timescale Markov decision process. We show that it can be recast, explicitly, as a classic Markov decision process with continuous state and action spaces, the solution to which can be found via standard techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935204.pdf","startPage":"461","endPage":"465","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935204","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple timescale dispatch and scheduling for stochastic reliability in smart grids with wind generation integration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Markov processes","Wind energy generation","Pricing","Uncertainty","Schedules","Elasticity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes","power generation planning","power generation reliability","power grids","wind power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple timescale dispatch","multiple timescale scheduling","stochastic reliability","smart grids","wind generation integration","volatile renewable energy resources","bulk power grid","traditional energy user","opportunistic energy user","smart meter","smart appliance","day-ahead scheduling","real-time scheduling","statistical information","energy supply","day-ahead retail price","Markov decision process"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935204/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multiple timescale dispatch and scheduling for stochastic reliability in smart grids with wind generation integration","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935204/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12085994","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple timescale dispatch and scheduling for stochastic reliability in smart grids with wind generation integration","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p461he.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045875S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935204","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5935209,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Lei","affiliation":["Eurecom, Sophia Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Lei","id":"37087941037"},{"name":"Laura Cottatellucci","affiliation":["Eurecom, Sophia Antipolis, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Cottatellucci","id":"38491386700"},{"name":"Konstantin Avrachenkov","affiliation":["INRIA, Sophia-Antipolis, France","INRIA, Sophia Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Konstantin","lastName":"Avrachenkov","id":"37266454500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935209","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":186},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Resource management","Bayesian methods","Fading","Noise","Interference channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","fading channels","game theory","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["slow fading interfering channel","partial knowledge","block fading interference channel","partial channel state information","power allocation","rate allocation","game theoretic framework","outage event","resource allocation","Bayesian game","stability property","Nash equilibrium"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935209","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935209.pdf","startPage":"481","endPage":"485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Equilibriums in slow fading interfering channels with partial knowledge of the channels","abstract":"We consider a block fading interference channels with partial channel state information and we address the issue of joint power and rate allocation in a game theoretic framework.

Born in economics, stable matching efficiently resolves conflicts of interest among selfish agents in the market, with a simple and elegant procedure of deferred acceptance. We illustrate through one technical case study how it can be applied in practical scenarios where the impeding complexity of idiosyncratic factors makes defining a utility function difficult. Due to its use of generic preferences, stable matching has the potential to offer efficient and practical solutions to networking problems, while its mathematical structure and rich literature in economics provide many opportunities for theoretical studies. In closing, we discuss open questions when applying the stable matching framework.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935232","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935232.pdf","startPage":"586","endPage":"590","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Seen as stable marriages","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935232","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935232/","displayDocTitle":"Seen as stable marriages","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12086022","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935232/","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Seen as stable marriages","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p586xu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068098S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5935233,"authors":[{"name":"Gaoning He","affiliation":["LSS, CNRS and Sup\u00e9lec and Universit\u00e9 Paris Sud 11, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Gaoning","lastName":"He","id":"37391441400"},{"name":"Samson Lasaulce","affiliation":["LSS, CNRS and Sup\u00e9lec and Universit\u00e9 Paris Sud 11, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Samson","lastName":"Lasaulce","id":"37284485800"},{"name":"Yezekael Hayel","affiliation":["Laboratory Informatique d' Avignon, Universit\u00e9 d''Avignon, Avignon, France"],"firstName":"Yezekael","lastName":"Hayel","id":"37282414400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935233","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":789},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lead","Transmitters","Games"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","power control","radio networks","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Stackelberg games","energy-efficient power control","wireless networks","energy-efficiency","multilevel hierarchical game","equilibrium analysis","cognitive transmitters","heterogeneous networks"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses the power control problem in wireless networks where transmitters choose their control policy freely and selfishly in order to maximize their individual energy-efficiency.

In both scenarios the equilibrium analysis (existence, uniqueness, determination, efficiency) is conducted. In scenario 1, it is proved that the game outcome Pareto dominates the one obtained when no transmitters can sense the others. Taking the sensing cost into account, a simple condition under which being a follower (namely a transmitter who senses) is better than a leader is provided. Interestingly, the existence of an optimum fraction of cognitive transmitters in terms of sum utility is proved in the case where the sensing cost is neglected. In scenario 2, it is proved analytically that knowing more leads to a better utility and the game outcome Pareto dominates the solution with no sensing. The derived results are illustrated by numerical results and provide some insights on how to deploy cognitive radios in heterogeneous networks in terms of sensing capabilities.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935233","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935233.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","startPage":"591","endPage":"595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stackelberg games for energy-efficient power control in wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stackelberg games for energy-efficient power control in wireless networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935233/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12086023","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5935233/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stackelberg games for energy-efficient power control in wireless networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p591he.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104671S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5935240,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaokang Yu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Shandong University, China"],"firstName":"Xiaokang","lastName":"Yu","id":"37716691700"},{"name":"Xiaomeng Ban","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaomeng","lastName":"Ban","id":"37720179600"},{"name":"Wei Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37393948000"},{"name":"Rik Sarkar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, USA"],"firstName":"Rik","lastName":"Sarkar","id":"37312297300"},{"name":"Xianfeng Gu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, USA"],"firstName":"Xianfeng","lastName":"Gu","id":"37276603700"},{"name":"Jie Gao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, USA"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Gao","id":"37279694000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935240","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":378},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spherical representation and polyhedron routing for load balancing in wireless sensor networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935240.pdf","startPage":"621","endPage":"625","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935240","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Face","Batteries","Load management","Wireless networks","Optimization","Three dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational geometry","distributed algorithms","graph theory","greedy algorithms","optimisation","resource allocation","telecommunication network routing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spherical representation","polyhedron routing","wireless sensor networks","load balanced routing","continuous setting","geodesic routing","sensor nodes","convex polyhedron","message delivery","Koebe-Andreev-Thurston theorem","3-connected planar graphs","discrete Ricci flow","distributed algorithm","M\u00f6bius transformation","optimization routine","load balancing property","greedy routing scheme"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935240","abstract":"In this paper we address the problem of scalable and load balanced routing for wireless sensor networks.

Adopting Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology, we devise two many-to-one cooperative schemes under converge-cast for both static and mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), respectively. In a static network, our scheme highly utilizes hierarchical cooperation MIMO transmission. This feature overcomes the bottleneck which hinders converge-cast traffic from yielding ideal performance in traditional ad hoc network, by turning the originally interfering signals into interference-resistant ones. It helps to achieve an aggregate throughput up to \u03a9(n\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1-\u03b5</sup>\n) for any \u03b5 >; 0. In the mobile ad hoc case, our scheme characterizes on joint transmission from multiple nodes to multiple receivers. With optimal network division where the number of nodes per cell is constant bounded, the achievable per-node throughput can reach \u0398(1) with the corresponding delay reduced to \u0398(k). The gain comes from the strong and intelligent cooperation between nodes in our scheme, along with the maximum number of concurrent active cells and the shortest waiting time before transmission for each node within a cell. This, to a great extent, increases the chances for each destination to receive the data it needs with minimum overhead on extra transmission. Moreover, our converge-based analysis well unifies and generalizes previous work since the results derived from converge-cast in our schemes can also cover other traffic patterns. Last but not least, our cooperative schemes are of interest not only from a theoretical perspective but also shed light on future design of MIMO schemes in wireless networks.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935244","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935244.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","startPage":"649","endPage":"657","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Converge-cast with MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935244","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Converge-cast with MIMO","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935244/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12086034","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5935244/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Converge-cast with MIMO","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p649fu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095942S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935244","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5935247,"authors":[{"name":"Vivek Shrivastava","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin, Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Vivek","lastName":"Shrivastava","id":"37654060300"},{"name":"Petros Zerfos","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

For example, simply moving an overloaded VM to a (random) underloaded physical machine can inadvertently overload the network. We introduce AppAware-a novel, computationally efficient scheme for incorporating (1) inter-VM dependencies and (2) the underlying network topology into VM migration decisions.

In particular, the future communication system might be used as alternative positioning, navigation, and timing means in case other navigation means, e.g. satellite based navigation, are temporally not available due to intentional or unintentional interference. The approach how navigation is achieved using the future communication system is described and first results about the feasibility of this approach are presented. The accuracy of the aircraft positioning estimates turns out to be in the order of 1 to 100 m, depending on the number and geographic distribution of the ground stations used for determining the underlying ranging estimates. Considering the horizontal aircraft position only, an even higher accuracy is achieved, since the ground stations are located at comparable altitude leading to a dominant position error in the vertical component. These promising first results lead to the conclusion that navigation with the future communication system is a very interesting approach for the alternative positioning, navigation, and timing system required as fallback solution for satellite-based navigation.","doi":"10.1109/ICNSURV.2011.5935294","publicationTitle":"2011 Integrated Communications, Navigation, and Surveillance Conference Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Integrated Communications, Navigation, and Surveillance Conference Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/5881376/5935117/05935294.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNSURV.2011.5935294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5935117","startPage":"J1-1","endPage":"J1-12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using the future L-band communication system for navigation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935294","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Using the future L-band communication system for navigation","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935294/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12085598","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5935294/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using the future L-band communication system for navigation","confLoc":"Herndon, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"j1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052184S","chronDate":"10-12 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5881376","isNumber":"5935117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5881376","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5935117","articleId":"5935294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5935298,"authors":[{"name":"Mahdi Hajiaghayi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Hajiaghayi","id":"37295715600"},{"name":"Min Dong","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT), Canada"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Dong","id":"37402785200"},{"name":"Ben Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Liang","id":"37287338100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935298","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":733},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Relays","OFDM","Optimization","Joints","Complexity theory","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","optimisation","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal channel-user assignment","power allocation","dual-hop multichannel multiuser relaying","single-relay multiple-access system","transmitter","three-dimensional assignment problem"]}],"abstract":"We consider the problem of jointly optimizing channel pairing, channel-user assignment, and power allocation in a single-relay multiple-access system.

It is of essential importance to measure the forwarding quality of multi-hop paths and such information shall be utilized in designing efficient routing strategies. Existing metrics like ETX, ETF mainly focus on quantifying the link performance in between the nodes while overlooking the forwarding capabilities inside the sensor nodes. The experience on manipulating GreenOrbs, a large-scale sensor network with 330 nodes, reveals that the quality of forwarding inside each sensor node is at least an equally important factor that contributes to the path quality in data delivery. In this paper we propose QoF, Quality of Forwarding, a new metric which explores the performance in the gray zone inside a node left unattended in previous studies. By combining the QoF measurements within a node and over a link, we are able to comprehensively measure the intact path quality in designing efficient multi-hop routing protocols. We implement QoF and build a modified Collection Tree Protocol (CTP). We evaluate the data collection performance in a test-bed consisting of 50 TelosB nodes, and compare it with the original CTP protocol. The experimental results show that our approach takes both transmission cost and forwarding reliability into consideration, thus achieving a high throughput for data collection.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935299","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935299.pdf","startPage":"775","endPage":"783","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935299","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"QoF: Towards comprehensive path quality measurement in wireless sensor networks","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935299/","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12086052","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935299/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoF: Towards comprehensive path quality measurement in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p775wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058252S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935299","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":5935302,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Zhu","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37405780700"},{"name":"Zhefu Jiang","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhefu","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37405774200"},{"name":"Zhen Xiao","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37392602100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935302","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":21,"totalDownloads":730},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Virtual machine monitors","Web and internet services","Ash","Image storage","Operating systems","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","quality of service","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast resource provisioning mechanism","Internet service","Amazon EC2-style cloud computing service","VM","virtual machine","TPC-W","RUBiS","QoS","twinkle"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Twinkle: A fast resource provisioning mechanism for internet services","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","endPage":"810","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935302.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935302","startPage":"802","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935302","abstract":"A key benefit of Amazon EC2-style cloud computing service is the ability to instantiate a large number of virtual machines (VMs) on the fly during flash crowd events.

This problem has not been solved satisfactorily in existing cloud services. We develop a fast start technique for cloud applications by restoring previously created VM snapshots of fully initialized application. We propose a set of optimizations, including working set estimation, demand prediction, and free page avoidance, that allow an application to start running with only partially loaded memory, yet without noticeable performance penalty during its subsequent execution. We implement our system, called Twinkle, in the Xen hypervisor and employ the two-dimensional page walks supported by the latest virtualization technology. We use the RUBiS and TPC-W benchmarks to evaluate its performance under flash crowd and failure over scenarios. The results indicate that Twinkle can provision VMs and restore the QoS significantly faster than the current approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935302/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12086055","htmlLink":"/document/5935302/","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Twinkle: A fast resource provisioning mechanism for internet services","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Twinkle: A fast resource provisioning mechanism for internet services","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p802zhu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056366S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5935304,"authors":[{"name":"Fan Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37398795600"},{"name":"Nitin Vaidya","affiliation":["ECE & Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Nitin","lastName":"Vaidya","id":"37278499300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935304","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":59,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":486},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["strategy-proof mechanism","radio spectrum allocation","SMALL","wireless communication","sealed-bid reserve auction","multiradio spectrum buyers"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SMALL: A Strategy-proof Mechanism for radio spectrum allocation","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","endPage":"85","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935304.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935304","startPage":"81","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935304","abstract":"With the growing deployment of wireless communication technologies, radio spectrum is becoming a scarce resource.

However, security is the major concern that prevents the wide adoption of computation outsourcing in the cloud, especially when end-user's confidential data are processed and produced during the computation. Thus, secure outsourcing mechanisms are in great need to not only protect sensitive information by enabling computations with encrypted data, but also protect customers from malicious behaviors by validating the computation result. Such a mechanism of general secure computation outsourcing was recently shown to be feasible in theory, but to design mechanisms that are practically efficient remains a very challenging problem. Focusing on engineering computing and optimization tasks, this paper investigates secure outsourcing of widely applicable linear programming (LP) computations. In order to achieve practical efficiency, our mechanism design explicitly decomposes the LP computation outsourcing into public LP solvers running on the cloud and private LP parameters owned by the customer. The resulting flexibility allows us to explore appropriate security/efficiency tradeoff via higher-level abstraction of LP computations than the general circuit representation. In particular, by formulating private data owned by the customer for LP problem as a set of matrices and vectors, we are able to develop a set of efficient privacy-preserving problem transformation techniques, which allow customers to transform original LP problem into some random one while protecting sensitive input/output information. To validate the computation result, we further explore the fundamental duality theorem of LP computation and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions that correct result must satisfy. Such result verification mechanism is extremely efficient and incurs close-to-zero additional cost on both cloud server and customers. Extensive security analysis and experiment results show the immediate practicability of our mechanism design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935305/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12086058","htmlLink":"/document/5935305/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Secure and practical outsourcing of linear programming in cloud computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure and practical outsourcing of linear programming in cloud computing","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p820wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084502S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"162","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935305","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5935306,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Cao","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, USA"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Cao","id":"37409984200"},{"name":"Cong Wang","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Illinois Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Cong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37405908500"},{"name":"Ming Li","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, USA"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Li","id":"37404559600"},{"name":"Kui Ren","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Illinois Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Kui","lastName":"Ren","id":"37288795500"},{"name":"Wenjing Lou","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, USA"],"firstName":"Wenjing","lastName":"Lou","id":"37275345500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9921-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"5935306","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":277,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3674},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Data privacy","Indexes","Privacy","Cloud computing","Encryption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cryptography","data privacy","query processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["privacy-preserving multikeyword ranked search","cloud computing","data encryption","data privacy","plaintext keyword search","cloud data utilization system","multikeyword semantics","coordinate matching measurement","inner product similarity measurement","single keyword search","Boolean keyword search"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935306","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935306.pdf","startPage":"829","endPage":"837","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935306","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Privacy-preserving multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted cloud data","abstract":"With the advent of cloud computing, data owners are motivated to outsource their complex data management systems from local sites to the commercial public cloud for great flexibility and economic savings. But for protecting data privacy, sensitive data has to be encrypted before outsourcing, which obsoletes traditional data utilization based on plaintext keyword search. Thus, enabling an encrypted cloud data search service is of paramount importance. Considering the large number of data users and documents in the cloud, it is necessary to allow multiple keywords in the search request and return documents in the order of their relevance to these keywords. Related works on searchable encryption focus on single keyword search or Boolean keyword search, and rarely sort the search results. In this paper, for the first time, we define and solve the challenging problem of privacy-preserving multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted cloud data (MRSE). We establish a set of strict privacy requirements for such a secure cloud data utilization system. Among various multi-keyword semantics, we choose the efficient similarity measure of \u201ccoordinate matching\u201d, i.e., as many matches as possible, to capture the relevance of data documents to the search query. We further use \u201cinner product similarity\u201d to quantitatively evaluate such similarity measure. We first propose a basic idea for the MRSE based on secure inner product computation, and then give two significantly improved MRSE schemes to achieve various stringent privacy requirements in two different threat models. Thorough analysis investigating privacy and efficiency guarantees of proposed schemes is given. Experiments on the real-world dataset further show proposed schemes indeed introduce low overhead on computation and communication.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935306/","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 April 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12086059","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5935306/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Privacy-preserving multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted cloud data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy-preserving multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted cloud data","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p829cao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108498S","chronDate":"10-15 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5888673","isNumber":"5934870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5888673","citationCount":"277","xplore-issue":"5934870","articleId":"5935306","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5935312,"authors":[{"name":"Yunhao Liu","affiliation":["1.

Does the wireless sensor network really scale? We present findings from a large scale operating sensor network system, GreenOrbs, with up to 330 nodes deployed in the forest. We instrument such an operating network throughout the protocol stack and present observations across layers in the network. Based on our findings from the system measurement, we propose and make initial efforts to validate three conjectures that give potential guidelines for future designs of large scale sensor networks. (1) A small portion of nodes bottlenecks the entire network, and most of the existing network indicators may not accurately capture them. (2) The network dynamics mainly come from the inherent concurrency of network operations instead of environment changes. (3) The environment, although the dynamics are not as significant as we assumed, has an unpredictable impact on the sensor network. We suggest that an event-based routing structure can be trained optimal and thus better adapt to the wild environment when building a large scale sensor network.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935312","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","pdfPath":"/iel5/5888673/5934870/05935312.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934870","startPage":"873","endPage":"881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Does wireless sensor network scale?

We characterize subscriber mobility and temporal activity patterns and identify their relation to traffic volume.

The typical processing is based on power spectral density estimation applied to the slow-time samples gathered at each depth. The Welch estimator is typically employed, but it features a good spectral resolution only if the observation window (OW) (i.e. data processed for a single estimate) is composed of at least 64-128 samples. Adaptive spectral estimators capable of producing good resolution with reduced OWs, have recently been proposed for spectrogram calculation. In this work we apply Capon and APES adaptive estimator to spectral profile assessment, obtaining good profiles with short OWs. This result can be exploited for improving the temporal resolution and/or introducing multiple Doppler lines.

The results show that smaller gaps are favorable.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5935439","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5875051/5935428/05935439.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5935439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5935428","startPage":"175","endPage":"180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement and FEM/BEM simulation of transverse effects in SAW resonators in lithium tantalate","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935439","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Measurement and FEM/BEM simulation of transverse effects in SAW resonators in lithium tantalate","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935439/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"12084874","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5935439/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement and FEM/BEM simulation of transverse effects in SAW resonators in lithium tantalate","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IUS2010000023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085415S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5875051","isNumber":"5935428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875051","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5935428","articleId":"5935439","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5935451,"authors":[{"name":"Brooks D.

The objective is to increase the frame rate and still maintain a beamforming quality sufficient for flow estimation that is possible to implement in a commercial scanner. A dual stage beamformer is used to beamform the data. In the first stage data are beamformed with a fixed transmit and receive focal point to obtain conventional RF lines. Then the fully dynamic second beamformer uses the data from the first stage to beamform the full image. High resolution image (HRI) lines obtained from the second stage beamformer are input to the velocity estimator. There are four emissions in each emission sequence, which repeat over time. In each emission 32 elements are excited for transmission and 64 elements are used for receiving signals. Thus, four low resolution lines generated in the first stage are input to the second stage beamformer to generate a HRI. Velocities are estimated by cross correlating RF lines n and n + N, where n is the global emission index and N is the number of emissions in one sequence. Furthermore, the velocity profile can be obtained by dividing RF lines into small segments, thus, they are calculated as a function of depth. The performance of this approach has been studied using simulations by Field II and different parameters are studied to reveal the robustness of this approach. For different spacings between emission lines [2, 6, 10, 14]\u03bb, the standard deviation and the bias of the axial velocity component were [1.92, 2.0, 2.07, 2.21]% and [0.61, 1.07, 1.29, 1.5]%, respectively, compared to the peak velocity. With a spacing of 10\u03bb, varying the number of emission sets [1, 2, 4, 6, 8] used for averaging resulted in standard deviations of [7.14, 2.28, 2.07, 1.92, 1.36]% and bias [11.43, 2.36, 1.29, 1.29, 1.22]%. The parameter study showed that larger spacings gave an increased standard deviation and bias. Furthermore, performance improves if more emissions sets are used for averaging. The performance of the simulation indicates that this dual beamformer approach was able to estimate the flow velocity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935586/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12085016","htmlLink":"/document/5935586/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Synthetic aperture flow imaging using a dual stage beamformer approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthetic aperture flow imaging using a dual stage beamformer approach","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IUS2010000267.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049078S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5875051","isNumber":"5935428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875051","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5935428","articleId":"5935586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5935587,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Mansour","affiliation":["Systems and Applications Research and Development Center, Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Mansour","id":"38181688200"},{"name":"Murtaza Ali","affiliation":["Systems and Applications Research and Development Center, Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Murtaza","lastName":"Ali","id":"37337060000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0381-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0382-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0380-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-0117"},{"format":"CD","value":"1948-5719"}],"articleNumber":"5935587","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":237},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transducers","Ultrasonic imaging","Correlation","Signal processing algorithms","Compression algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Quantization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","array signal processing","radio receivers","redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrasound RF data","lossless compression","ultrasound sensor data","transducers RF data","analog-to-digital converter","receiver beamformer","redundancy","low-power mode","ultrasound signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lossless compression","ultrasound","transducer","sensors","DSP"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935587","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5935587","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","abstract":"We propose an efficient algorithm for lossless compression of ultrasound sensor data.

These effects tend to distort the beam pattern produced by conventional phased arrays, defocusing the ultrasonic field transmitted through the barrier and causing image quality degradation and resolution loss. To compensate for the refraction and multiple reflection effects, we developed an adaptive beamforming algorithm for small-aperture linear phased arrays. After assessing the barrier's local geometry, the method calculates a new timing distribution to refocus the distorted beam at its original location. The procedure is in fact a construction of a matched filter that automatically adapts the transmission pattern of the phased array to the local geometry of the barrier and cancels its distorting effect. In this work, the adaptive beamforming algorithms, in transmission mode, for the barriers in the form of a flat homogeneous layer, a layer with a smooth, randomly curved back surface and a two-layered combination of the above have been developed and experimentally verified on custom-engineered samples with prescribed acoustical properties. The algorithms were implemented on ULA-OP, an ultrasound advanced open-platform (University of Florence), controlling 64 active elements on a 128-elements phased array. Experimental measurements of original, distorted and corrected beam profiles confirm the ability of our algorithms to refocus the beam after passing through a scattering and refractive sample. Different excitation signals and windowing options introduced through ULA-OP were examined and compared.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935595/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12085025","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935595/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive beamforming for ultrasonic phased array focusing through layered structures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive beamforming for ultrasonic phased array focusing through layered structures","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IUS2010000280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054513S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5875051","isNumber":"5935428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875051","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5935428","articleId":"5935595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5935616,"authors":[{"name":"Markus Mayer","affiliation":["Surface Acoustic Wave Components, EPCOS AG, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Mayer","id":"37302120300"},{"name":"Gholamreza Dadgar-Javid","affiliation":["Surface Acoustic Wave Components, EPCOS AG, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Gholamreza","lastName":"Dadgar-Javid","id":"38270864800"},{"name":"Wolfgang Sauer","affiliation":["Surface Acoustic Wave Components, EPCOS AG, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Sauer","id":"37430071200"},{"name":"Tilo Gartner","affiliation":["Surface Acoustic Wave Components, EPCOS AG, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Tilo","lastName":"Gartner","id":"38277543100"},{"name":"Karl Wagner","affiliation":["Surface Acoustic Wave Components, EPCOS AG, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Karl","lastName":"Wagner","id":"37281601200"},{"name":"Sabine Zaglmayr","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t Graz, Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Sabine","lastName":"Zaglmayr","id":"37542392600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0381-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0382-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0380-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-0117"},{"format":"CD","value":"1948-5719"}],"articleNumber":"5935616","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Electrodes","Passivation","Chebyshev approximation","Lithium","Oxidation","Substrates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ab initio calculations","anodisation","boundary-elements methods","finite element analysis","lithium compounds","passivation","surface acoustic wave devices","surface contamination"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FEM/BEM simulation","SAW components","electrode passivation","anodic oxidation","surface contamination","dielectric layer","electrode/substrate interface","ab inito simulation","SAW devices","charge localization","orthogonal Chebyshev basis","finite element method","boundary element method","lithium tantalate","LiTaO3"]}],"abstract":"In order to reduce the sensibility of SAW components to surface contamination and avoid short cuts between electrodes, anodic oxidation is employed to passivate the electrode with a thin dielectric layer. This layer covers the electrodes, but not the regions between electrodes. Since for these structures, only part of the electrode/substrate interface carries charge, the efficient standard ab inito simulation method for SAW devices, based on the approximation of charge localization at the electrode/substrate interface, is not directly applicable. In this work this approach is generalized to devices passivated by anodic oxidation. As in the prior scheme, electrodes are treated as purely mechanical and introduction of an orthogonal Chebyshev basis set leads to an efficient Finite element/Boundary element (FEM/BEM) coupling scheme. For test resonators on 42\u00b0YX lithium tantalate the method is verified. Comparison with the Finite Element method shows that the underlying approximation of a purely mechanical electrode is justified. A good agreement with measurement is obtained.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5935616","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5875051/5935428/05935616.pdf","startPage":"171","endPage":"174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5935616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5935428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FEM/BEM simulation of SAW components with electrode passivation by anodic oxidation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935616","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935616/","displayDocTitle":"FEM/BEM simulation of SAW components with electrode passivation by anodic oxidation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"12085046","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935616/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FEM/BEM simulation of SAW components with electrode passivation by anodic oxidation","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IUS2010000313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074649S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5875051","isNumber":"5935428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875051","xplore-issue":"5935428","articleId":"5935616","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5935626,"authors":[{"name":"Lasse Lovstakken","affiliation":["Department Circulation and Medical Imaging, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Lasse","lastName":"Lovstakken","id":"37300327400"},{"name":"Hans Torp","affiliation":["Department Circulation and Medical Imaging, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Hans","lastName":"Torp","id":"37300330900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0381-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0382-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0380-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-0117"},{"format":"CD","value":"1948-5719"}],"articleNumber":"5935626","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935626","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Imaging","Clutter","Image color analysis","Frequency response","Time frequency analysis","Array signal processing","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","biological organs","biomedical transducers","biomedical ultrasonics","blood vessels","clutter","flow visualisation","medical image processing","time-varying filters","ultrasonic transducer arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["color flow imaging","parallel receive beamforming","slow-time ensembles","thyroid vascular imaging","carotid vascular imaging","peripheral vessels","time-variant clutter filters","flashing artifacts","linear array ultrasound transducer"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5935626","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5875051/5935428/05935626.pdf","startPage":"1198","endPage":"1201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5935626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5935428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extended velocity range in color flow imaging using parallel receive beamforming","abstract":"In this work we investigate how advances in parallel receive beamforming (PRB) can be utilized to increase the velocity range in color flow imaging, through the acquisition and processing of longer slow-time ensembles (>;20) at high pulse repetition frequencies.

In the last years synthetic aperture focusing has moved from the lab to commercial products. The implementations vary in their scope and purpose. Some scanners use synthetic aperture imaging to improve the detail and contrast resolution of the system. Others to increase the image uniformity. Yet others use synthetic aperture acquisition to achieve high frame rates and superior flow estimations. On the other end of the scale are the systems that utilize synthetic aperture techniques to reduce the data rate and take advantage of modern computer hardware. Retrospecitve transmit beamformation, zone sonography, and multiple angle flash imaging are just a few of the names used to describe the commercial implementations of synthetic aperture focusing.

In this paper, we present the development of a software beamformer for SAI and PWI with real-time parallel processing capacity. Our beamformer design comprises a pipelined group of graphics processing units (GPU) that are hosted within the same computer workstation. During operation, each available GPU is assigned to perform demodulation and beamforming for one frame of pre-beamform data acquired from one transmit firing (e.g. point firing for SAI). To facilitate parallel computation, the GPUs have been programmed to treat the calculation of depth pixels from the same image scanline as a block of processing threads that can be executed concurrently, and it would repeat this process for all scanlines to obtain the entire frame of image data - i.e. low-resolution image (LRI). To reduce processing latency due to repeated access of each GPU's global memory, we have made use of each thread block's fast-shared memory (to store an entire line of pre-beamform data during demodulation), created texture memory pointers, and utilized global memory caches (to stream repeatedly used data samples during beamforming). Based on this beamformer architecture, a prototype platform has been implemented for SAI and PWI, and its LRI processing throughput has been measured for test datasets with 40 MHz sampling rate, 32 receive channels, and imaging depths between 5-15 cm. When using two Fermi-class GPUs (GTX-470), our beamformer can compute LRIs of 512-by-255 pixels at over 3200 fps and 1300 fps respectively for imaging depths of 5 cm and 15 cm. This processing throughput is roughly 3.2 times higher than a Tesla-class GPU (GTX-275).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935689/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12085118","htmlLink":"/document/5935689/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Real-time GPU-based software beamformer designed for advanced imaging methods research","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time GPU-based software beamformer designed for advanced imaging methods research","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IUS2010000440.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080952S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5875051","isNumber":"5935428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875051","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5935428","articleId":"5935689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5935694,"authors":[{"name":"Pascal Ventura","affiliation":["PV Research and Development Consulting, Nice, France"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Ventura","id":"37320285600"},{"name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Hecht","affiliation":["Laboratoire Jacques Louis Lions, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric","lastName":"Hecht","id":"37708020100"},{"name":"Pierre Dufili\u00e9","affiliation":["Phonon Corporation, Simsbury, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Dufili\u00e9","id":"37390738700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0381-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0382-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0380-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-0117"},{"format":"CD","value":"1948-5719"}],"articleNumber":"5935694","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Electrodes","Numerical models","Surface acoustic waves","Boundary conditions","Dielectrics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustoelectric effects","boundary-elements methods","finite element analysis","interdigital transducers","surface acoustic wave devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["periodic buried IDT analysis","single electrode","FEM/BEM numerical model","SAW designs","quartz","unburied metal electrodes","waveguide modes","thicker metal","buried electrode geometry","reactive ion etch","electro-acoustical behavior","piezoelectric substrate","dielectric domain","piezoelectric semispaces","boundary integral formulations","Bloch Floquet's conditions"]}],"abstract":"The use of buried electrodes in SAW designs on quartz has important advantages when compared with unburied metal electrodes on the surface. One important property is the suppression of waveguide modes in transducers. A second advantage is the ability to use thicker metal thereby reducing the resistive losses. A numerical model for the buried electrodes is a useful tool for optimizing the buried electrode geometry. The numerical model can be extended to include the case of raised electrodes where a given depth of non-metalized substrate has been removed by reactive ion etch (RIE). This paper describes a new numerical model that is used to simulate the electro-acoustical behavior of a single periodic buried (or partially buried) IDT. In order to take into account the buried part of the electrode, it is necessary to include in the FEM domain the buried electrode along with part of the piezoelectric substrate, and of the dielectric domain above the electrode. The dielectric and the piezoelectric semi-spaces are taken into account with boundary integral formulations while Bloch Floquet's conditions are expressed on the lateral boundaries using an original and efficient method.

Often, the displacement has a very small amplitude, for example when estimating motion of slow moving flow or when the frame rate is very high. In this study, we propose a method adapted to very small displacement estimation, about 1/10 of the wavelength. This method is inspired by multi-beam methods. It uses multiple ID displacements along prebeamformed signals, which are then recombined to estimate the 2D displacement. Other multi-beam techniques are based on a small number of ID estimations. Using more ID estimations strongly improves the precision of the estimated displacement field. The estimation is done in two steps: 1D displacements are estimated along prebeamformed signals focused around the point of interest. 1D displacements are then recombined to form the 2D displacement using a motion model. We show that 1D displacements are projections of the real displacement of the point. The method is validated both experimentally on a large set of translated phantom. In both simulation and experimental cases, we show that our method leads to an average 1\u03bcm \u00d7 100nm mean error along transverse and axial direction, compared to 5\u03bcm \u00d7 1\u03bcm along transverse and axial direction for classical speckle-tracking method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935717/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12085145","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935717/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Motion estimation using prebeamformed ultrasound signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion estimation using prebeamformed ultrasound signals","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IUS2010000485.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046832S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5875051","isNumber":"5935428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875051","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5935428","articleId":"5935717","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5935730,"authors":[{"name":"Alper \u015ei\u015fman","affiliation":["Isik University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Alper","lastName":"\u015ei\u015fman","id":"38558661400"},{"name":"Mustafa Karaman","affiliation":["Isik University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mustafa","lastName":"Karaman","id":"37283937600"},{"name":"G\u00f6k\u00e7e G\u00fcr\u00fcn","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"G\u00f6k\u00e7e","lastName":"G\u00fcr\u00fcn","id":"38505184000"},{"name":"F.

Furthermore, massive memories for storing the pre-beamformed radio frequency (RF) data are required, leading to substantial increase in hardware complexity. In this paper, we propose the efficient real-time SA beamformer architecture that could be integrated in modern ultrasound imaging systems.

Possible reasons for this may include key issues of (1) long-term device reliability and (2) electrical safety issues associated with relatively high voltage electrodes on device surfaces which could present an electrical safety hazard to patients. A double SOI CMUT design which addresses both these issues is presented. A 1-D model of dielectric surface charging, which suggests that minimal surface roughness of the dielectric layer can minimize surface charge accumulation is also proposed. Fabricated devices are engineered to minimize dielectric surface roughness. To provide maximum electrical safety to future patients, CMUT devices were engineered with the top membrane serving as a ground electrode. Bottom electrodes are individually-addressable. Our devices were modeled using a finite-element package. The experiment results show excellent agreement with modeled performance. Charge effects were explored by studying deflection hysteresis during snapdown and snapback cycles in the limit of long snapdown durations to simulate maximal dielectric charging conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5935744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5935744","startPage":"1881","endPage":"1885","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5875051/5935428/05935744.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5935428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CMUTs with improved electrical safety & minimal dielectric surface charging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"CMUTs with improved electrical safety & minimal dielectric surface charging","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935744/","accessionNumber":"12255285","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935744/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CMUTs with improved electrical safety & minimal dielectric surface charging","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IUS2010000787.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047197S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5875051","isNumber":"5935428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875051","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5935428","articleId":"5935744","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5935762,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Such images have shown their potential for improving motion estimation. In this paper we present an alternative to Time Domain Transverse Oscillations (TDTO) beamforming. Conventional approaches to TO use Fraunhoffer approximation to design their beamformer, which is not respected for broadband signals. We propose to proceed to a Fourier Transform of the raw Rf signals before apodization in order to separate the contribution of each frequency band and adapt the apodization function to each frequency. This method is refered to as Fourier Domain Transverse Oscillations (FDTO) beamforming. FDTO is validated by simulations on PSFs obtained with FDTO and TDTO. Their comparison shows higher normalized cross-correlation with FDTO than TDTO for expected transverse oscillations wavelength between 1 and 2.5 mm in our configuration. FDTO is also validated on a speckle phantom. Visually FDTO PSFs, PSFs and specke images 2D spectra have lost the diagonal orientation of their pattern.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935762/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12255303","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935762/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fourier domain beamforming for transverse-oscillations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fourier domain beamforming for transverse-oscillations","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IUS2010000503.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046258S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5875051","isNumber":"5935428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875051","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5935428","articleId":"5935762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5935766,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Successful CS reconstruction implies selecting a basis where the signal to be recovered has a sparse expansion. RF signals represent a specific challenge, because their oscillatory nature does not easily lend itself to a sparse representation. In that perspective, we propose to use the recently introduced directional wave atoms, which shows good properties for sparsely representing warped oscillatory patterns. Experiments were performed on simulated RF data from a cyst numerical phantom. CS reconstruction was applied to subsampled RF data, by removing 50% to 90% of the original samples.

The 64 boards in the system house 16 transmit and 16 receive channels each, where data can be stored in 2 GB of RAM and processed using four Virtex 4FX100 and one FX60 FPGAs. The VHDL code can acquire data for 16 channels and perform real-time processing for four channels per board. The receive processing chain consists of three FPGAs. The beamformer FPGA houses 24 focusing units (6 \u00d7 4-way) each working in parallel at 220 MHz for parallel four-channel beamforming. The fully parametric focusing unit calculates delays and apodization values in real time in 3D space and can produce 630 million complex samples per second. The processing can, thus, beamform 192 image lines consisting of 1024 complex samples for each emission at a rate of 3200 frames a second yielding full non recursive synthetic aperture B-mode imaging at more than 30 high resolution images a second.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5935767","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5875051/5935428/05935767.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5935428","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5935767","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","startPage":"305","endPage":"309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of SARUS: A synthetic aperture real-time ultrasound system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935767","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Performance of SARUS: A synthetic aperture real-time ultrasound system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935767/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935767/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"12255308","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of SARUS: A synthetic aperture real-time ultrasound system","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IUS2010000510.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.161394S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5875051","isNumber":"5935428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875051","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5935428","articleId":"5935767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5935769,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Tajic","affiliation":["TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc., Apopka, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Tajic","id":"37704638200"},{"name":"Alexandre Volatier","affiliation":["TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc., Apopka, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Volatier","id":"37298025500"},{"name":"Robert Aigner","affiliation":["TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc., Apopka, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Aigner","id":"37274230800"},{"name":"Marc Solal","affiliation":["TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc., Apopka, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Solal","id":"37272991600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0381-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0382-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0380-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-0117"},{"format":"CD","value":"1948-5719"}],"articleNumber":"5935769","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":500},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Finite element methods","Substrates","Acoustics","Green's function methods","Impedance","Resonant frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic resonators","boundary-elements methods","bulk acoustic wave devices","finite element analysis","semiconductor device models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["solidly mounted BAW resonator","FEM","BEM","PML","finite element method","bulk acoustic wave resonator","perfectly matched layer","artificial reflection","boundary element method","resonator impedance"]}],"abstract":"Finite element method (FEM) has become an important approach in the modeling of bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonators.

With the correct adjustment of PML parameters, the resonator impedance computed with the FEM/PML model approaches the FEM/BEM results, both are in good agreement with the measured data.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5935769","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5875051/5935428/05935769.pdf","startPage":"181","endPage":"184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5935769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5935428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation of solidly mounted BAW resonators using FEM combined with BEM and/or PML","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935769","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935769/","displayDocTitle":"Simulation of solidly mounted BAW resonators using FEM combined with BEM and/or PML","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"12255310","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935769/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of solidly mounted BAW resonators using FEM combined with BEM and/or PML","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IUS2010000513.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.139031S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5875051","isNumber":"5935428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875051","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5935428","articleId":"5935769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5935775,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The system is composed of 256 channels of analog front-end pulser/receiver, 64 channels of Time-Gain Compensation (TGC), 64 channels of high-speed digitizer as well as a beamformer. A PC is used as user interface to display the real time images. This system is designed for imaging using up to 256 elements linear arrays. The system provides 64 channels of excitation pulsers while receiving simultaneously at a 20 MHz-500 MHz sampling rate with 12-bit resolution. The digitized data of all channels are first fed through FPGAs, and then stored in memories. Those raw data are accessed by the beamforming processor to rebuild the image or download to the PC for further processing. The beamformer that applies delays to the echoes of each channel is implemented with the strategy that combines coarse and fine delays. The coarse delays are integer multiple the sampling clock rate. They are achieved by controlling write enable pin of First-In-First-Out memory to obtain valid beamforming data. The fine delays are accomplished with interpolation filters. The design allows a maximum frame rate of 50 frames per second to be achieved. The wire phantom images show the spatial resolution of 146 \u03bcm (lateral) and 54 \u03bcm (axial). Images with excised rabbit and pig eyeball as well as mouse embryo were acquired.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5935819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5935428","startPage":"1972","endPage":"1975","pdfPath":"/iel5/5875051/5935428/05935819.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010

elements in an ultrasound array are damaged, the beamforming performance and imaging quality (contrast and resolution) will be significantly reduced due to the distorted beam pattern with for example, a significant increase of sidelobe level. Defective elements can be detected through either in-direct impedance measurement or direct monitoring of the acoustic output using fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. In this paper, we demonstrate that via recalculating the weights (apodization) of the remaining functional elements, a new pattern that is close to the original can be formed, thus the array failure is corrected. Since a damaged array can be considered as a non-uniformly spaced array, analytic methods are generally unable to tackle this kind of problem. A numerical approach based on genetic algorithms (GA) to reconfigure the apodization distribution of remaining elements is presented. This technique provides a cost effective alternative to hardware replacement, and potentially produces 'smart ultrasonic arrays' with capability of self restoration from failures throughout the operating lifetime when incorporating with a detection procedure.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935820/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12255361","htmlLink":"/document/5935820/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Array element failure correction for robust ultrasound beamforming and imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Array element failure correction for robust ultrasound beamforming and imaging","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IUS2010000588.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067988S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5875051","isNumber":"5935428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875051","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5935428","articleId":"5935820","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5935838,"authors":[{"name":"Yufeng Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Bradley University, Peoria, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Yufeng","lastName":"Lu","id":"37292929200"},{"name":"Alireza Kasaeifard","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Kasaeifard","id":"37708178400"},{"name":"Erdal Oruklu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Erdal","lastName":"Oruklu","id":"37300225600"},{"name":"Jafar Saniie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Jafar","lastName":"Saniie","id":"37300151000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0381-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0382-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0380-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-0117"},{"format":"CD","value":"1948-5719"}],"articleNumber":"5935838","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":450},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustics","Signal resolution","Time frequency analysis","Fourier transforms","Chirp","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","Fourier transforms","inverse problems","iterative methods","source separation","time-frequency analysis","ultrasonic materials testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fractional Fourier transform","time-frequency analysis","NDE application","ultrasonic signal decomposition","transformation tool","optimal transform order","amplitude response","kurtosis value","fractional transform domain","inverse FrFT","iterative manner","nonstationary ultrasonic signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fractional Fourier transform (FrFT)","time-frequency analysis","signal decomposition","ultrasonic signal"]}],"abstract":"Recently, there has been a growing attention on fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) for time-frequency analysis. In this investigation, an FrFT-based signal decomposition algorithm is utilized to decompose ultrasonic signals into a linear combination of signal components. As a transformation tool, FrFT is employed to estimate an optimal transform order, which leads to the maximum amplitude response, or the highest kurtosis value in the fractional transform domain. Furthermore, a signal component is obtained by applying a window in the fractional domain and inverse FrFT. In an iterative manner, ultrasonic signals are decomposed into the signal components until a predefined stop criterion is satisfied. Analytical and simulation results show that FrFT is an alternative method to perform high-resolution analysis of nonstationary ultrasonic signals.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5935838","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5875051/5935428/05935838.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5935838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5935428","startPage":"2028","endPage":"2031","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of fractional Fourier transform(FrFT) for time-frequency analysis of ultrasonic signals in NDE applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935838","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of fractional Fourier transform(FrFT) for time-frequency analysis of ultrasonic signals in NDE applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935838/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"12255379","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5935838/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of fractional Fourier transform(FrFT) for time-frequency analysis of ultrasonic signals in NDE applications","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IUS2010000618.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066494S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5875051","isNumber":"5935428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875051","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5935428","articleId":"5935838","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5935839,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Mansour","affiliation":["Systems and Applications Research and Development Center, Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Mansour","id":"38181688200"},{"name":"Murtaza Ali","affiliation":["Systems and Applications Research and Development Center, Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Murtaza","lastName":"Ali","id":"37337060000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0381-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0382-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0380-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-0117"},{"format":"CD","value":"1948-5719"}],"articleNumber":"5935839","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":145},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic imaging","Decorrelation","Image coding","Noise","Imaging","Quantization","Wavelet packets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","array signal processing","ultrasonics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lossy compression","beamformer ultrasound data","Karhunloeve like transform","ultrasound probe","compression algorithm","postbeamformer compression","prebeamformer compression","ultrasound signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ultrasound","digital signal processing","lossy compression","transducer"]}],"abstract":"We present a framework for lossy compression of ultrasound RF data.

The effectiveness of the compression algorithm for both pre-beamformer and post-beamformer compression is established by evaluating the performance on a set of simulated ultrasound signals.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5935839","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5875051/5935428/05935839.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5935428","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5935839","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","startPage":"2299","endPage":"2302","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A lossy compression scheme for pre-beamformer and post-beamformer ultrasound data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935839","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A lossy compression scheme for pre-beamformer and post-beamformer ultrasound data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935839/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935839/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"12255380","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A lossy compression scheme for pre-beamformer and post-beamformer ultrasound data","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IUS2010000620.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.130832S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5875051","isNumber":"5935428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875051","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5935428","articleId":"5935839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5935843,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaochen Xu","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaochen","lastName":"Xu","id":"37290499500"},{"name":"Harish Venkataraman","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Harish","lastName":"Venkataraman","id":"37717530600"},{"name":"Sandeep Oswal","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Sandeep","lastName":"Oswal","id":"37268328200"},{"name":"Eduardo Bartolome","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Eduardo","lastName":"Bartolome","id":"37416225200"},{"name":"Karthik Vasanth","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Karthik","lastName":"Vasanth","id":"37352021900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0381-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0382-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0380-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-0117"},{"format":"CD","value":"1948-5719"}],"articleNumber":"5935843","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":989},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935843","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic imaging","Noise","Doppler effect","Mixers","BiCMOS integrated circuits","CMOS process","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical transducers","biomedical ultrasonics","bipolar analogue integrated circuits","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","portable instruments","ultrasonic transducers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog front-ends design","portable ultrasound systems","ultrasound imaging","semiconductor technology","silicon processes","bipolar process","CMOS process","transducer technology"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5935843","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5875051/5935428/05935843.pdf","startPage":"310","endPage":"313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5935843","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5935428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Challenges and considerations of analog front-ends design for portable ultrasound systems","abstract":"High performance portable ultrasound imaging system is demanded by a wide variety of point of care applications.

Under a restriction of desired number of active channels, we can maximize the image quality by optimally choosing the positions of active elements. Here we use the method of simulated annealing to find the optimal configuration of a 2-D sparse array. This algorithm tries to minimize the value of an objective function defined as the energy ratio between the non-focal and focal regions in the point spread function (PSF). Optimal configurations were found for the cases of choosing 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32 transmit and receive elements from a 16 \u00d7 16-element rectangular transducer array. With only 32 transmit and 32 receive elements, we could achieve an energy ratio of 16%, compared to 6% of the full array, which is the gold standard utilizing all the 256 elements for both transmit and receive. Using Field II, we simulated imaging with the optimal sparse arrays, for off-axis targets as well as on-axis targets, and the resulting images were compared with those from some other configurations, such as full-transmit full-receive, full-transmit x-receive, x-transmit boundary-receive, and so on.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5935854","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5935428","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5875051/5935428/05935854.pdf","endPage":"1931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design optimization for a 2-D sparse transducer array for 3-D ultrasound imaging","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5935854","startPage":"1928","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935854","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Design optimization for a 2-D sparse transducer array for 3-D ultrasound imaging","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935854/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12255395","pubMedId":"21822365","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5935854/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design optimization for a 2-D sparse transducer array for 3-D ultrasound imaging","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IUS2010000643.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068115S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5875051","isNumber":"5935428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875051","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5935428","articleId":"5935854","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5935915,"authors":[{"name":"Lequan Zhang","affiliation":["NIH Transducer Resource Center and Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Lequan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37538572400"},{"name":"Changhong Hu","affiliation":["NIH Transducer Resource Center and Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Changhong","lastName":"Hu","id":"37292942000"},{"name":"Jesse T.

Each channel of the proposed beamformer consisted of a coarse delay and a fine delay circuit block. The delay blocks were implemented using wide bandwidth tapped delay lines. Multiplexers were used to select the output taps of the fine delay and coarse delay. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) devices which stored the delay profile of each channel were used to update the control signals for the multiplexers at each scan line and focal zone switching. Due to the transient effect when turning a switch on or off, glitch noise could be introduced during each focal zone transition. A differential circuit, as well as switch offsetting, was used to suppress such an effect. The design was shown to be capable of providing a total delay of 157 ns with a resolution of Ins. The rise time of the cascading delay lines was 8.66 ns, which set the -3dB bandwidth to about 40MHz. The test on two channels of the beamformer showed a 20 dB improvement in SNR by the two glitch suppressing methods. Phantoms images shows that the system can achieve lateral resolution of 120 \u03bcm, and can resolve anechoic spheres as small as 300 \u03bcm in diameter.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5935915","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5875051/5935428/05935915.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5935428","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5935915","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","startPage":"1968","endPage":"1971","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a 64 channel analog receive beamformer for high frequency linear arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935915","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Design of a 64 channel analog receive beamformer for high frequency linear arrays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935915/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935915/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"12255456","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a 64 channel analog receive beamformer for high frequency linear arrays","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IUS2010000840.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065297S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5875051","isNumber":"5935428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875051","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5935428","articleId":"5935915","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5935937,"authors":[{"name":"Sarp Satir","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Sarp","lastName":"Satir","id":"38557646900"},{"name":"Gokce Gurun","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Gokce","lastName":"Gurun","id":"38505184000"},{"name":"Jaime Zahorian","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Jaime","lastName":"Zahorian","id":"38503191500"},{"name":"Mustafa Karaman","affiliation":["Isik University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mustafa","lastName":"Karaman","id":"37283937600"},{"name":"Paul Hasler","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Hasler","id":"37270054200"},{"name":"Levent Degertekin","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA","School of Mechanical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Levent","lastName":"Degertekin","id":"38559374800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0381-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0382-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0380-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-0117"},{"format":"CD","value":"1948-5719"}],"articleNumber":"5935937","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":346},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Delay","Array signal processing","Acoustics","Pistons","Probes","Integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical transducers","biomedical ultrasonics","bioMEMS","blood vessels","capacitive sensors","microsensors","ultrasonic transducer arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["annular CMUT array beamforming system","high frequency side looking IVUS imaging","capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer","intravascular ultrasound","CMUT membrane","IC chip","transimpedance amplifier","delay element","electrical pulse","acoustic crosstalk effect","transmit receive beamforming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["annular arrays","beamforming","CMUTs","Side Looking Intravascular Ultrasound"]}],"abstract":"A CMUT annular array system for Side-Looking Intravascular Ultrasound (SL-IVUS) with fixed transmit and dynamic receive focusing capabilities has been developed.

The array consists of curved 18\u03bcm by 60\u03bcm CMUT membranes that form 8 ring transducer elements with approximately equal areas. The beamforming system uses an IC chip consisting of 8 transimpedance amplifiers and delay elements for receive beamforming with adjustable delays between 2ns and 4ns, that are constant up to 50 MHz with close to unity gain. Transmit focusing is implemented with an FPGA controlled, high voltage pulser board that can generate adjustable electrical pulses with delays as small as 2ns.

In order to minimize size, reduce external noise and deliver transmit energy to transducer efficiently in a system with the coded excitation, digital waveform generator and power amplifier should be placed on a single board. The pulser with capability of doing arbitrary waveform amplification was custom-designed and developed for a high frequency coded excitation imaging system. The matching of input stage was achieved by transmission line transformer (TLT) with ferrite core. Using TLT, matching circuit became simple otherwise it would require matching circuit using lumped components. Transformers were used between stages. The 6dB bandwidth of developed amplifier was from 10MHz to 110MHz. In the pass band, the gain of amplifier fluctuated within 4dB. Wire target measurements and ex-vivo measurements on tissues clearly demonstrated its superior performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5935948/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"12255489","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Linear power amplifier for high frequency ultrasound coded excitation imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear power amplifier for high frequency ultrasound coded excitation imaging","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IUS2010000902.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040153S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5875051","isNumber":"5935428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875051","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5935428","articleId":"5935948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5935950,"authors":[{"name":"Sandy Cochran","affiliation":["Institute of Medical Science and Technology, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK"],"firstName":"Sandy","lastName":"Cochran","id":"37300292000"},{"name":"Anne Bernassau","affiliation":["Microsystem Technology, Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Anne","lastName":"Bernassau","id":"37400467400"},{"name":"David Cumming","affiliation":["Microsystem Technology, Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Cumming","id":"37276149400"},{"name":"Christine D\u00e9mor\u00e9","affiliation":["Institute of Medical Science and Technology, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK"],"firstName":"Christine","lastName":"D\u00e9mor\u00e9","id":"37268822700"},{"name":"Marc Desmulliez","affiliation":["Microsystems Engineering Centre, School of Engineering, Physics and Maths, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Desmulliez","id":"37300518800"},{"name":"John Sweet","affiliation":["Loadpoint Limited, Swindon, Wiltshire, UK"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Sweet","id":"37302073400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0381-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0382-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0380-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-0117"},{"format":"CD","value":"1948-5719"}],"articleNumber":"5935950","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":525},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic imaging","Consumer electronics","Materials","Field programmable gate arrays","Fabrication","Transducers","Acoustics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","piezoelectric transducers","ultrasonic transducer arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["silicon electronics","miniature piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers","semiconductor electronics","Moore's law","medical ultrasound imaging","ultrasound system","transducer array","electronic instrumentation","multicore physical cabling","functional density","communication bandwidth","interface instrumentation","transducer technology","financial investment","microelectromechanical system","integrated circuit electronics","device assembly","microsystems engineering","power supply","system partitioning","piezoelectric material","electronics technology","MEMS roadmap"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["integrated electronics","piezoelectric materials","miniature devices"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5935950","abstract":"The long-established pace of progress in semiconductor electronics, expressed by Moore's Law, has led to new opportunities in medical ultrasound imaging. Traditionally, ultrasound systems have separated the transducer array from most of the electronic instrumentation, with multicore physical cabling in between. This avoids problems with electrical power, functional density, and communication bandwidth. However, it is far from ideal in terms of cost, ergonomics, and the need to interface instrumentation and the transducer with the cable, and it causes particular difficulties with miniature devices. Given these issues, and the relatively slow progress in front end transducer technology, integration of the transducer with electronics is certain to increase, most likely at a pace governed by financial investment, development of electronics for other applications, and the realisation of high volume ultrasound applications. This paper therefore considers motivations for increased integration, technical barriers, and relevant new techniques, particularly related to microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Increased integration will rely on advances in integrated circuit (IC) electronics, device assembly, and microsystems engineering, with key constraints being the packaging of a system in a small volume and the power supply. System partitioning will determine where functionality will reside physically within the imaging hardware and software. This paper considers relevant recent developments in academic research and industry, with a particular focus on medical applications. IC design is important because it defines parameters such as power consumption. 45 nm ICs are now in high volume production but the present relatively small ultrasound market makes adoption difficult. Ingenuity in exploiting existing technology cost-effectively and bespoke engineering where required are likely to be important for integration of piezoelectric material with electronics technology and functionality will correspond with different layers in a device. In this paper, examples are selected from the authors' work to illustrate progress and suggest how MEMS roadmaps and application demands may relate to future systems.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5935950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5935950","startPage":"1108","endPage":"1116","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Ultrasonics

mechanical noise based characterization of CMUTs using monolithically integrated low noise receiver electronics","abstract":"Monolithic integration of CMUTs and CMOS electronics minimizes interconnect parasitics which is essential for low noise receiver design. Ideally the system noise should be dominated by the CMUT thermal-mechanical noise, which is shaped by CMUT electrical impedance. In addition to improved signal to noise ratio (SNR), a thermal mechanical noise limited detection system can be helpful to reveal information on CMUT characteristics. A transimpedance amplifier is custom designed in 0.35\u03bcm CMOS to be monolithically integrated with a forward looking volumetric imaging CMUT array element. TIA design is optimized to minimize noise taking advantage of the minimized parasitics provided by CMUT-on-CMOS approach. Output noise spectrum of the TIA connected to the CMUT element in air with and without DC bias clearly shows that the noise spectrum has a peak at the CMUT resonance frequency when a DC bias is applied. This demonstrates that noise measurements of CMUT elements in air can be used to characterize uniformity and functionality of array elements without the need for any external electrical or acoustic inputs. Transducer noise dominated detection in immersion is demonstrated through output noise spectrum measurement of the integrated system in water tank. A noise figure of 1.76dB is obtained in the CMUT bandwidth. In addition, the relation between the CMUT impedance and noise spectrum can provide means for implementing other types of sensors using CMUTs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5935987/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12255528","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5935987/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Thermal mechanical noise based characterization of CMUTs using monolithically integrated low noise receiver electronics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal mechanical noise based characterization of CMUTs using monolithically integrated low noise receiver electronics","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IUS2010000968.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042883S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5875051","isNumber":"5935428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875051","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5935428","articleId":"5935987","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5936006,"authors":[{"name":"Yen-Feng Li","affiliation":["Institute of Biomedical Electronics and Bioinformatics, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yen-Feng","lastName":"Li","id":"37715807800"},{"name":"Pai-Chi Li","affiliation":["Institute of Biomedical Electronics and Bioinformatics, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pai-Chi","lastName":"Li","id":"37276870300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0381-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0382-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0380-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-0117"},{"format":"CD","value":"1948-5719"}],"articleNumber":"5936006","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":255},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Transform coding","Radio frequency","Baseband","Imaging","Image quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","data acquisition","data compression","image coding","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrasound beamforming","data transfer","beamforming quality","JPEG2000 compression","acoustic data acquisation","128-channel array transducer","image quality","RF data compression","baseband data compression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data compression","software-based beamforming","ultrasonic imaging"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936006","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5936006","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","abstract":"With the rapid advancement in electronics technologies, software-based beamformers for ultrasound array imaging have become feasible, and thus allowing rapid development of a high performance and potentially low cost system. However, to realize a fully software based system, one challenge is data transfer from the analog front end to the software backend, whose data rate can be up to a few GB/sec. It is therefore the purpose of this study to investigate the use of data compression for reducing data transfer requirements and the associated tradeoff with beamforming quality. JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) and JPEG2000 compression were adopted. The acoustic data were acquired with a 128-channel array transducer at a center frequency of 3.5MHz. On each transmit event, the receive channel data are separated into 8\u00d78 blocks, followed by the application of data compression. In one scheme, the compression is done on raw RF data. In another scheme, baseband data are used and only amplitude of the data is compressed. The maximum compression ratio of RF data compression is 15 with JPEG and 20 with JPEG2000 when the average error is less than 5 dB. With baseband data compression, on the other hand, although the maximum compression ratio is less than 8, the image quality is better than RF data compression. The average error in this case is less than 1.5 dB when the compression ratio is less than 7.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5936006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5935428","startPage":"1912","endPage":"1915","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5875051/5935428/05936006.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrasound beamforming with compressed data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936006/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5936006/","displayDocTitle":"Ultrasound beamforming with compressed data","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"12255546","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrasound beamforming with compressed data","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IUS2010001013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047313S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5875051","isNumber":"5935428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875051","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5935428","articleId":"5936006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5936009,"authors":[{"name":"Craig K.

Based on this analysis, we provide suggestions to real-time system designers for selecting the most suitable technology, and for optimizing system development on this platform, for a number of diverse applications.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2011.120","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6204246/05936059.pdf","startPage":"999","endPage":"1012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2011.120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6204246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparison of FPGA and GPU for Real-Time Phase-Based Optical Flow, Stereo, and Local Image Features","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Comparison of FPGA and GPU for Real-Time Phase-Based Optical Flow, Stereo, and Local Image Features","volume":"61","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"24 May 2012","accessionNumber":"12761141","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5936059/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936059/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparison of FPGA and GPU for Real-Time Phase-Based Optical Flow, Stereo, and Local Image Features","sourcePdf":"ttc2012070999.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111512S","chronDate":"July  2012","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6204246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"6204246","articleId":"5936059","onlineDate":"30 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5936073,"authors":[{"name":"Ce Liu","affiliation":["Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA","Microsoft Research New England, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6047995/5936073/5936073-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ce Liu received the BS degree in automation and the ME degree in pattern recognition from the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University in 1999 and 2002, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a novel, nonparametric approach for object recognition and scene parsing using a new technology we name label transfer. For an input image, our system first retrieves its nearest neighbors from a large database containing fully annotated images. Then, the system establishes dense correspondences between the input image and each of the nearest neighbors using the dense SIFT flow algorithm [28], which aligns two images based on local image structures. Finally, based on the dense scene correspondences obtained from SIFT flow, our system warps the existing annotations and integrates multiple cues in a Markov random field framework to segment and recognize the query image. Promising experimental results have been achieved by our nonparametric scene parsing system on challenging databases. Compared to existing object recognition approaches that require training classifiers or appearance models for each object category, our system is easy to implement, has few parameters, and embeds contextual information naturally in the retrieval/alignment procedure.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/6047995/05936073.pdf","startPage":"2368","endPage":"2382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonparametric Scene Parsing via Label Transfer","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2011.131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6047995","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2011.131","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936073","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936073/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Nonparametric Scene Parsing via Label Transfer","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12301557","pubMedId":"21709305","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"33","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5936073/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonparametric Scene Parsing via Label Transfer","sourcePdf":"ttp2011122368.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111652S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6047995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"232","xplore-issue":"6047995","articleId":"5936073","onlineDate":"30 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5936075,"authors":[{"name":"Nayot Poolsappasit","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8858/6078484/5936075/5936075-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nayot Poolsappasit received the PhD degree from Colorado State University in 2010.

On one hand, models such as attack graphs and attack trees have been proposed to assess the cause-consequence relationships between various network states, while on the other hand, different decision problems have been explored to identify the minimum-cost hardening measures. However, these risk models do not help reason about the causal dependencies between network states. Further, the optimization formulations ignore the issue of resource availability while analyzing a risk model. In this paper, we propose a risk management framework using Bayesian networks that enable a system administrator to quantify the chances of network compromise at various levels. We show how to use this information to develop a security mitigation and management plan. In contrast to other similar models, this risk model lends itself to dynamic analysis during the deployed phase of the network. A multiobjective optimization platform provides the administrator with all trade-off information required to make decisions in a resource constrained environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936075/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2012","volume":"9","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12358093","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5936075/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Security Risk Management Using Bayesian Attack Graphs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Security Risk Management Using Bayesian Attack Graphs","sourcePdf":"ttq2012010061.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084623S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"6078484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"297","xplore-issue":"6078484","articleId":"5936075","onlineDate":"30 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5936087,"authors":[{"name":"Guo-Wei Lu","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Guo-Wei Lu (M'08) received the Ph.D. degree in information engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Hong Kong, in 2005.","From 2005 to 2006, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at CUHK.

In this paper, a low-complexity intrachannel nonlinear compensator operating at the symbol rate is proposed based on the nonlinear perturbation predistortion for the dual-polarization quadrature phase-shift keying (DP-QPSK) systems. Compared with the widely studied backpropagation algorithm, the proposed algorithm achieves comparable performance with significantly reduced complexity and halved sampling speed in digital signal processing and digital-to-analog converters. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated in a 43 Gb/s DP-QPSK transmission experiment over 1500 km. In addition to the experimental demonstration, numerical simulation verifies that the proposed algorithm is quite robust by tolerating significant uncertainties of link parameters and span-by-span inhomogeneity in the links.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5983458/05936088.pdf","startPage":"2570","endPage":"2576","publicationTitle":"Journal of

It arises in various application domains, including distributed tracking and localization, multi-agent coordination, estimation in sensor networks, and large-scale machine learning. We develop and analyze distributed algorithms based on dual subgradient averaging, and we provide sharp bounds on their convergence rates as a function of the network size and topology. Our analysis allows us to clearly separate the convergence of the optimization algorithm itself and the effects of communication dependent on the network structure. We show that the number of iterations required by our algorithm scales inversely in the spectral gap of the network, and confirm this prediction's sharpness both by theoretical lower bounds and simulations for various networks. Our approach includes the cases of deterministic optimization and communication, as well as problems with stochastic optimization and/or communication.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936104/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","volume":"57","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12557809","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5936104/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dual Averaging for Distributed Optimization: Convergence Analysis and Network Scaling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual Averaging for Distributed Optimization: Convergence Analysis and Network Scaling","sourcePdf":"tac-duchi-2161027-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107438S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6157057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"551","xplore-issue":"6157057","articleId":"5936104","onlineDate":"30 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5936114,"authors":[{"name":"Annan Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6106034/5936114/5936114-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Annan Li received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer science from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2003 and 2006, respectively.

From this viewpoint, we first revisited the problem of recognizing faces across pose differences, which is a bottleneck in face recognition. Then, we propose a new approach for cross-pose face recognition using a regressor with a coupled bias-variance tradeoff. We found that striking a coupled balance between bias and variance in regression for different poses could improve the regressor-based cross-pose face representation, i.e., the regressor can be more stable against a pose difference. With the basic idea, ridge regression and lasso regression are explored. Experimental results on CMU PIE, the FERET, and the Multi-PIE face databases show that the proposed bias-variance tradeoff can achieve considerable reinforcement in recognition performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coupled Bias\u2013Variance Tradeoff for Cross-Pose Face Recognition","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2011.2160957","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6106034/05936114.pdf","startPage":"305","endPage":"315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2011.2160957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6106034","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936114","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936114/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Coupled Bias\u2013Variance Tradeoff for Cross-Pose Face Recognition","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5936114/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12425591","pubMedId":"21724510","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coupled Bias\u2013Variance Tradeoff for Cross-Pose Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"tip-li-2160957-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085685S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6106034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"6106034","articleId":"5936114","onlineDate":"30 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5936118,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaoxiang Zhang","affiliation":["Laboratory of Intelligent Recognition and Image Processing, Beijing Key Laboratory of Digital Media, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6106034/5936118/5936118-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhaoxiang Zhang (M'08) received the B.S. degree in electronic science and technology from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2004 and the Ph.D. degree in pattern recognition and intelligent systems from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2009, respectively.","In October 2009, he joined the Laboratory of Intelligent Recognition and Image Processing, Beijing Key Laboratory of Digital Media, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, as a Lecturer.","His research interests include computer vision, pattern recognition, image processing, and machine learning."]},"firstName":"Zhaoxiang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37537892500"},{"name":"Tieniu Tan","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6106034/5936118/5936118-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Tieniu Tan (F'03) received the B.Sc. degree in electronic engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 1984 and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from Imperial College London, London, U.K., in 1986 and 1989, respectively.","In October 1989, he joined the Computational Vision Group, Department of Computer Science, University of Reading, Reading, U.K., where he worked as a Research Fellow, a Senior Research Fellow, and a Lecturer.

Our aim is to localize and recognize road vehicles from monocular images or videos in calibrated traffic scenes. A 3-D deformable vehicle model with 12 shape parameters is set up as prior information, and its pose is determined by three parameters, which are its position on the ground plane and its orientation about the vertical axis under ground-plane constraints. An efficient local gradient-based method is proposed to evaluate the fitness between the projection of the vehicle model and image data, which is combined into a novel evolutionary computing framework to estimate the 12 shape parameters and three pose parameters by iterative evolution. The recovery of pose parameters achieves vehicle localization, whereas the shape parameters are used for vehicle recognition. Numerous experiments are conducted in this paper to demonstrate the performance of our approach. It is shown that the local gradient-based method can evaluate accurately and efficiently the fitness between the projection of the vehicle model and the image data. The evolutionary computing framework is effective for vehicles of different types and poses is robust to all kinds of occlusion.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2011.2160954","startPage":"1","endPage":"13","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6106034/05936118.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2011.2160954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6106034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-Dimensional Deformable-Model-Based Localization and Recognition of Road Vehicles","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Shape","Solid modeling","Deformable models","Three dimensional displays","Computational modeling","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","evolutionary computation","road vehicles","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-dimensional deformable-model-based localization","road vehicles","calibrated traffic scenes","3D deformable vehicle model","local gradient-based method","iterative evolution","vehicle recognition","evolutionary computing framework"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Evolutionary computing","fitness evaluation","model-based vision","vehicle localization","vehicle recognition","visual surveillance"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Models, Theoretical","Motor Vehicles","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936118/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Three-Dimensional Deformable-Model-Based Localization and Recognition of Road Vehicles","volume":"21","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5936118/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425595","pubMedId":"21724513","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-Dimensional Deformable-Model-Based Localization and Recognition of Road Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tip-zhang-2160954-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079563S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6106034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"6106034","articleId":"5936118","onlineDate":"30 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":5936119,"authors":[{"name":"Torleiv Klove","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway"],"bio":{"p":["Torleiv Kl\u00f8ve (M'89\u2013SM'91\u2013F'03) was born in Voss, Norway, in 1943.

The resonant circuit of the inductive power transfer system, driven by a current source, was fully characterized. The experimental results showed that the maximum output power was 35 kW and that the maximum efficiency was 74% at 27 kW.

This paper presents a method to monitor solder fatigue in a voltage source inverter insulated gate bipolar transistor power module by detecting the change of an inverter output harmonic. It is shown that low-order harmonics, caused by nonideal switching, are affected by the device junction temperature, which in turn depends upon module solder condition. To improve the detection accuracy of the phenomenon, the inverter controller is set to cause harmonic resonance at the target harmonic frequency. The would-be resonance is suppressed by an outer control loop where the control action can be used as the condition monitoring signal. Simulation and experiment are presented to validate the method and evaluate its performance in operation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6099646/05936125.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"247","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2160988","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2160988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6099646","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Condition Monitoring Power Module Solder Fatigue Using Inverter Harmonic Identification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Temperature measurement","Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Switches","Temperature dependence","Inverters","Junctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fatigue","power semiconductor devices","PWM invertors","solders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition monitoring power module solder fatigue","inverter harmonic identification","power semiconductor devices","voltage source inverter insulated gate bipolar transistor power module","nonideal switching","harmonic resonance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Condition monitoring","harmonic","identification","insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT)","power module","reliability","resonance","solder fatigue"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Condition Monitoring Power Module Solder Fatigue Using Inverter Harmonic Identification","volume":"27","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5936125/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12409249","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Condition Monitoring Power Module Solder Fatigue Using Inverter Harmonic Identification","sourcePdf":"tpel-ran-2160988-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104378S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6099646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"6099646","articleId":"5936125","onlineDate":"30 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5936138,"authors":[{"name":"Gangxiang Shen","affiliation":["School of Elec. and Info.

In contrast to conventional cell types which are well-planned by the operators, femtocell base stations are supposed to be installed by customers themselves, similar to a WiFi access point. Unlike WiFi, however, femtocells operate mainly in licensed bands, such that operators are in control of the radio interface. This brings new challenges as well as opportunities for femtocell design; these include sophisticated mobility and interference management, increased reliability, as well as deployment in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive progress in femtocell design has been made in Advanced WiMAX recently, which is associated with the IEEE 802.16m update in 2011.

The second part discusses TVWS, studying and summarizing the regulations governing its usage, and then reports on the standardization bodies' responses to these regulations with a focus on IEEE 802.11af, 802.19.1, and 802.22. Finally, the third part amalgamates the SUN usage model with TVWS regulations and deployment scenarios, providing relationship mapping between the SUN components and regulation-compliant TVWS devices. Further discussions concentrate on the opportunities and challenges along the path of realizing a practical SUN in the TVWS spectrum under the current technical and regulatory conditions. Several recommendations are made from both regulatory and technical standpoints to further increase utilization of SUNs in TVWS.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2011.5936166","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5936142/05936166.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2011.5936166","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","startPage":"132","endPage":"139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart utility networks in tv white space","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936166","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Smart utility networks in tv white space","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936166/","volume":"49","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5936166/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12093094","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart utility networks in tv white space","sourcePdf":"024SUMLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041538S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5936142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5936142","articleId":"5936166","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5936167,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel A.

However, the framework for a unified simulation methodology and platform has not been established. In this article, we propose a general unified simulation methodology for different cellular systems. Both the design of the simulation structure and the establishment of the simulation platform are studied. Meanwhile, the unified modeling and the realization of various modules related to the system-level simulation are presented. The proposed unified simulation methodology and the general simulation platform can be used to evaluate the performance of multiple mobile communication systems fairly. Finally, the overall performance of LTE and Mobile WiMAX systems is evaluated through the proposed framework. The key simulation results for both Full Buffer and VoIP traffics are presented and discussed. It is shown that the LTE system exhibits better performance than Mobile WiMAX.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2011.5936168","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2011.5936168","startPage":"148","endPage":"155","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5936142/05936168.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System-level simulation methodology and platform for mobile cellular systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"System-level simulation methodology and platform for mobile cellular systems","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","volume":"49","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5936168/","accessionNumber":"12093096","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936168/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System-level simulation methodology and platform for mobile cellular systems","sourcePdf":"026CHENLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160224S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5936142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5936142","articleId":"5936168","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5936170,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Mao Wang","affiliation":["Qualcomm Corporate Research Center, San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Michael Mao Wang (wangm@qualcomm.com) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Southeastern University (Nanjing Institute of Technology), China, and the M.S. degree in biomedical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky.

The results are unique in the sense that the spectral occupancy estimates are based on multiple years of observations, whereas previous studies produced occupancy numbers based on short term snapshot measurements, often of a few hours duration or at most spanning a few days or weeks. The measurements are also presented in a novel way: the occupancy data in a band of interest during a one year span is graphed as a 2-dimensional image that visually reveals daily, weekly, and yearly trends and anomalies. The main objective of this paper is to present year by year first-order statistics about the spectral occupancy across multiple bands, but more details are presented about radio usage in a few bands like the TV band. In particular, we examine the spectral opportunities that are seen in the newly available \u201cTV White Space\u201d. The results illustrate occupancy trends and notable spectral events, such as the 2009 broadcast television transition and the related vacating of the 700 MHz band, which have created significant spectrum opportunities in the 30-1000 MHz region. The trends reported are applicable to long term spectrum modeling, spectrum planning, and regulatory decision-making efforts applicable to dynamic spectrum access networks.","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936195","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910696/5936192/05936195.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936195","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","startPage":"100","endPage":"107","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Long-term spectral occupancy findings in Chicago","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936195","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Long-term spectral occupancy findings in Chicago","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936195/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5936195/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12086204","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long-term spectral occupancy findings in Chicago","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"p100taher.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05894S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910696","isNumber":"5936192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910696","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"5936192","articleId":"5936195","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5936198,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Chen","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37596809500"},{"name":"Jianwei Huang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jianwei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37293538200"},{"name":"Husheng Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Husheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37311296400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0178-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0177-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0176-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5936198","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":243},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936198","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Markov processes","Adaptation model","Algorithm design and analysis","Probabilistic logic","Throughput","Adaptive systems","Gaussian distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive channel recommendation","dynamic spectrum access","average reward based Markov decision process","optimal policy","model reference adaptive search method","static channel recommendation","random access scheme","channel dynamics"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936198","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910696/5936192/05936198.pdf","startPage":"116","endPage":"124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive channel recommendation for dynamic spectrum access","abstract":"We propose a dynamic spectrum access scheme where secondary users recommend \u201cgood\u201d channels to each other and access accordingly.

Our results show that we can significantly compressively acquire the signal while still accurately determining spectral occupancy.","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936202","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910696/5936192/05936202.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936192","startPage":"156","endPage":"163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing for dynamic spectrum access networks: Techniques and tradeoffs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936202","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing for dynamic spectrum access networks: Techniques and tradeoffs","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936202/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12086211","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5936202/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing for dynamic spectrum access networks: Techniques and tradeoffs","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"p156laska.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116686S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910696","isNumber":"5936192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910696","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5936192","articleId":"5936202","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5936205,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander W.

These attacks can easily disrupt the primary signal detection process, thus crippling the operation of dynamic spectrum access. While such sensing-targeted attacks can be easily launched by an attacker, it is very challenging to design a robust cooperative spectrum sensing scheme due mainly to the practical constraints inherent in spectrum sensing, particularly the shared/open nature of the wireless medium and the unpredictability of signal propagation. In this paper, we develop an efficient, yet simple attack detection framework, called IRIS (robust cooperatIve sensing via iteRatIve State estimation), that safeguards the incumbent detection process by checking the consistency among sensing reports via the estimation of system states, namely, the primary user's transmit-power and path-loss exponent. The key insight behind the design of IRIS is that the sensing results are governed by the network topology and the law of signal propagation, which cannot be easily compromised by an attacker. Consequently, the sensing reports must demonstrate consistency among themselves in estimating system states. Our analytical and simulation results show that, by performing consistency-checks, IRIS provides high attack-detection capability, and preserves satisfactory performance in estimating the system states even under very challenging attack scenarios. Based on these observations, we propose a new incumbent detection rule that can further improve the spectrum efficiency. IRIS can be readily deployed in infrastructure-based cognitive radio networks, such as IEEE 802.22 WRANs, with manageable processing and communication overheads.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936205/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12086214","htmlLink":"/document/5936205/","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Robust cooperative sensing via state estimation in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust cooperative sensing via state estimation in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"p185min.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079551S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910696","isNumber":"5936192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910696","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5936192","articleId":"5936205","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5936206,"authors":[{"name":"Pu Wang","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Networking Laboratory, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Pu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406354800"},{"name":"Ian F.

This paper provides an asymptotic analysis of the transmission delay experienced by SUs for DSA networks. It is shown that DSA induces only light-tailed delay as long as both the busy time of PU channels and the message size of SUs are light-tailed. On the contrary, if either the busy time or the message size is heavy tailed, then the SUs' transmission delay is heavy tailed. For this latter case, it is proven that if one of either the busy time or the message size is light-tailed and the other is regularly varying with index \u03b1, then the transmission delay is regularly varying with the same index \u03b1. As a consequence, the delay has an infinite mean provided \u03b1 <; 1 and an infinite variance provided \u03b1 <; 2. Furthermore, if both the busy time and the message size are regularly varying with index \u03b1 and \u03b2, respectively, then the tail distribution of the delay is as heavy as the one with the smaller index. Moreover, the impact of spectrum mobility and multi-radio diversity on the delay performance of SUs is studied. It is shown that the spectrum mobility can mitigate the heavy tailed delay of SUs, while the use of multiple radio interfaces may aggravate it.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Can dynamic spectrum access induce heavy tailed delay?","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936206","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910696/5936192/05936206.pdf","startPage":"197","endPage":"207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936192","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936206","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936206/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Can dynamic spectrum access induce heavy tailed delay?","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5936206/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12086215","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Can dynamic spectrum access induce heavy tailed delay?","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"p197wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124354S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910696","isNumber":"5936192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910696","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5936192","articleId":"5936206","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5936207,"authors":[{"name":"Jaap van de Beek","affiliation":["Radio Transmission Technologies-Research, Huawei Technologies Sweden AB, Kista, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jaap","lastName":"van de Beek","id":"37602319900"},{"name":"Janne Riihijarvi","affiliation":["Institute of Networked Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Janne","lastName":"Riihijarvi","id":"37266544100"},{"name":"Andreas Achtzehn","affiliation":["Institute of Networked Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Achtzehn","id":"37392129100"},{"name":"Petri Mahonen","affiliation":["Institute of Networked Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Petri","lastName":"Mahonen","id":"37266541100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0178-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0177-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0176-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5936207","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":623},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["White spaces","TV","Transmitters","Europe","Availability","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["television broadcasting","UHF radio propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UHF white space","Europe","TV white space","TV broadcasting","digital dividend","TV channel","geographic area","propagation model","statistical ITU-R model","Longley-Rice irregular terrain model","frequency 470 MHz to 790 MHz"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we study the availability of TV white spaces in Europe. We focus specifically on the 470-790 MHz UHF band that is still predominantly used for TV broadcasting also after the digital dividend (frequency reallocation as part of transition to digital TV), which has taken place or is ongoing in several European countries. We find that in the countries used in our studies, approximately 56% of the TV channels are unused, when averaged over the whole geographic area. Considering the average over population instead of geographic area reduced the mean available white space to 49% of the channels. Our results confirm quantitatively the often stated expectation that there are indeed fewer white spaces available in Europe compared to, for example, the United States. We also study the influence of different modeling assumptions on our results, especially focusing on the impact of the choice of propagation model. Our results show that changing from statistical ITU-R model to the Longley-Rice irregular terrain model does not cause a major change in the overall estimated availability of white spaces. However, changing the propagation model can significantly affect especially the local variability of the estimated availability of spectrum. This underlines the importance of using right system models in various studies before making too far-reaching conclusions.","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936207","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910696/5936192/05936207.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936207","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UHF white space in Europe \u2014 A quantitative study into the potential of the 470\u2013790 MHz band","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936207","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"UHF white space in Europe \u2014 A quantitative study into the potential of the 470\u2013790 MHz band","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936207/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5936207/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12086216","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UHF white space in Europe \u2014 A quantitative study into the potential of the 470\u2013790 MHz band","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"p1vandebeek.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072562S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910696","isNumber":"5936192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910696","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5936192","articleId":"5936207","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5936208,"authors":[{"name":"Kimmo Berg","affiliation":["Systems Analysis Laboratory, Aalto University School of Science, Aalto, Aalto, Finland"],"firstName":"Kimmo","lastName":"Berg","id":"38578252700"},{"name":"Arttu Klemettila\u00a8","affiliation":["Aalto-yliopisto, Aalto, FI"],"firstName":"Arttu","lastName":"Klemettila\u00a8"},{"name":"Mikko A.

In the current debate, there is a trend towards the use of a geo-location database only, driven by the fear that other techniques fail to achieve the required detection reliability. Therefore, in this paper we intend to assess if the technical and business value of sensing in the context of TVWS should be neglected. Taking in consideration the discussion on the adequate technical requirements currently taking place in Europe and the USA, the cost and performance of the proposed techniques for local sensing, distributed sensing and geo-location database are compared through a simple model. As a result, we conclude that using a distributed sensing solution based on low-cost low-power sensing engines, we could achieve a solution with hardware and energy costs a par with the geo-location database. However, by assessing the costs and business impacts for stakeholders such as manufacturers and White Spaces Service Providers we conclude that in the geo-location database solution, regulators, White Spaces Service Providers, White Spaces Database Providers and consumers may incur additional infrastructure, maintenance and administrative costs compared to a distributed sensing solution. Consequently, we are of the opinion that the distributed sensing solution in the context of TVWS does indeed present value and its business and technical impact should be considered in further research and regulatory activities.","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936212","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910696/5936192/05936212.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936212","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","startPage":"231","endPage":"241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The value of sensing for TV White Spaces","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936212","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"The value of sensing for TV White Spaces","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936212/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5936212/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12086221","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The value of sensing for TV White Spaces","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"p231goncalves.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09857S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910696","isNumber":"5936192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910696","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5936192","articleId":"5936212","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5936213,"authors":[{"name":"Ole Gr\u00f8ndalen","affiliation":["Telenor, Fornebu, Norway"],"firstName":"Ole","lastName":"Gr\u00f8ndalen","id":"37395101500"},{"name":"Markku L\u00e4hteenoja","affiliation":["Telenor, Fornebu, Norway"],"firstName":"Markku","lastName":"L\u00e4hteenoja","id":"37351280200"},{"name":"P\u00e5l Gr\u00f8nsund","affiliation":["Telenor, Fornebu, Norway"],"firstName":"P\u00e5l","lastName":"Gr\u00f8nsund","id":"37395104100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0178-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0177-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0176-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5936213","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":347},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936213","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Business","Ecosystems","Sensors","Mobile communication","Broadband communication","Wireless sensor networks","Subscriptions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business cases","cognitive radio network","wireless sensor network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","business case","sensor network","spectrum sharing","spectrum broker","new entrant"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936213","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910696/5936192/05936213.pdf","startPage":"242","endPage":"253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of business cases for a cognitive radio network based on wireless sensor network","abstract":"This paper proposes and evaluates three business case scenarios for deployment of a sensor network aided cognitive radio system in a typical European city. The first and main business case is based on spectrum sharing, where several spectrum owners establish a joint venture and this joint venture gets the rights to use the \u201cunused\u201d spectrum resources of all those spectrum owners in a cognitive way. Then we study the business case of a spectrum broker, an entity that deploys, builds and operates a sensor network and sells either sensing information or information on spectrum opportunities to one or more cognitive radio operators. Finally we analyze the potential of a new entrant without existing infrastructure or frequency licenses, that uses a sensor network aided cognitive radio system to offer a nomadic mobile broadband service. It is found that the spectrum sharing business case is one of the best possible cases for the studied system because the joint venture operator has free access to frequency resources of the mother companies, detailed knowledge of the primary systems and good possibilities for sharing infrastructure with the owning operators. However, since the studied system is an innovative concept and some of the assumed parameters are therefore uncertain, it should be noted that the main value of the business case calculations is to identify critical aspects influencing the profitability so that future research and development work can focus on them. It is found that the most critical aspects are the fixed sensor density, the fixed sensor operational costs and the number of new cognitive base station sites required.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936213/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12086222","publicationDate":"May 2011","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5936213/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of business cases for a cognitive radio network based on wireless sensor network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of business cases for a cognitive radio network based on wireless sensor network","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"p242grndalen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071134S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910696","isNumber":"5936192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910696","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5936192","articleId":"5936213","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5936215,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojun Feng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Xiaojun","lastName":"Feng","id":"37714391300"},{"name":"Jin Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37311567500"},{"name":"Qian Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37289940400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0178-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0177-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0176-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5936215","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":829},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Databases","White spaces","TV","Resource management","Interference","Bandwidth","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio spectrum management","television broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access points","database-assisted multi-AP network","AP discovery","TV white spaces","secondary users","geo-location database","multicell infrastructure-based secondary network","WhiteNet","dynamic spectrum access system","low-overhead distributed spectrum allocation","heterogeneous propagation property","GNU Radio testbed"]}],"abstract":"According to the FCC's final rule for the unlicensed use of TV white spaces, secondary users are required to query a geo-location database to determine whether a spectrum band is occupied or not. However, how to design a multi-cell infrastructure-based secondary network to dynamically access TV white spaces with the help of database is still an open issue. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of WhiteNet, a multi-cell infrastructure-based dynamic spectrum access system on TV white spaces. WhiteNet is compatible with the FCC's database architecture. In WhiteNet, the geo-location database is exploited to assist multi-AP coordination. A low-overhead distributed spectrum allocation algorithm is proposed to allocate spectrum among multiple APs in WhiteNet, considering the heterogeneous propagation property among various spectrum bands throughout TV white spaces. A novel AP discovery scheme is designed to enable users to discover and select the best access point to connect. We implement WhiteNet in a 7-node GNU Radio testbed, which demonstrates the feasibility of our system. Evaluation results show that our spectrum allocation algorithm can significantly increase total network throughput, besides, the AP discovery scheme is reliable and efficient.","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936215","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910696/5936192/05936215.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936215","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","startPage":"265","endPage":"276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Database-assisted multi-AP network on TV white spaces: Architecture, spectrum allocation and AP discovery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Database-assisted multi-AP network on TV white spaces: Architecture, spectrum allocation and AP discovery","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936215/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5936215/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12086224","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Database-assisted multi-AP network on TV white spaces: Architecture, spectrum allocation and AP discovery","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"p265feng.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085695S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910696","isNumber":"5936192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910696","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"5936192","articleId":"5936215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5936221,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Burke","affiliation":["Australian Communications and Media Authority, Belconnen, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Burke","id":"37721725200"},{"name":"Bridget T Lally","affiliation":["Australian Communications and Media Authority, Belconnen, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Bridget T","lastName":"Lally","id":"37703752900"},{"name":"Andrew J Kerans","affiliation":["Australian Communications and Media Authority, Belconnen, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Andrew J","lastName":"Kerans","id":"37280641000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0178-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0177-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0176-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5936221","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":692},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Mobile communication","Receivers","Radio transmitters","Cavity resonators","Interference","Band pass filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","intermodulation distortion","land mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual occupancy","cognitive radio technology","radiofrequency spectrum","cognitive radio device","intermodulation interference","licensed transmitter","land mobile radio service","intermodulation products","radiofrequency band"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","virutal occupancy","intermodulation interference","land mobile"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936221","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936221","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","abstract":"Cognitive radio technologies have the potential to increase the efficiency and effectiveness with which the radiofrequency spectrum is used. However, before cognitive radio devices are brought into widespread use, planning and regulatory arrangements must be considered and developed where appropriate to ensure adequate protection for existing users. This paper addresses the issue of harmful intermodulation interference caused by the mixing of a transmission from a cognitive radio device with that from a licensed transmitter in the land mobile radio service. Due to the generation of intermodulation products, seemingly open channels may be unable to be used by cognitive radio devices. This situation is termed virtual occupancy. In this paper, a model is described to characterise the effect of virtual occupancy on the availability of channels for use by a cognitive radio device in the land mobile service in the radiofrequency band from 450 to 470 MHz. The results show that for areas where the spectrum is highly allocated, virtual occupancy could be a significant barrier to the deployment of cognitive radios in the land mobile radio service.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936192","startPage":"328","endPage":"336","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910696/5936192/05936221.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual occupancy in cognitive radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936221/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5936221/","displayDocTitle":"Virtual occupancy in cognitive radio","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12086230","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual occupancy in cognitive radio","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"p328burke.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052154S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910696","isNumber":"5936192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910696","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5936192","articleId":"5936221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5936222,"authors":[{"name":"Beno\u00eet Pierre Freyens","affiliation":["Economics, Faculty of Business & Government, University of Canberra, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Beno\u00eet Pierre","lastName":"Freyens","id":"37392228600"},{"name":"Mark Loney","affiliation":["Australian Communications and Media Authority, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Loney","id":"37392872300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0178-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0177-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0176-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5936222","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":184},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936222","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadcasting","TV","White spaces","Wireless communication","FCC","Licenses","Telecommunications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","radio broadcasting","radio spectrum management","telecommunication switching","UHF radio propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["white space usage rights","digital switchover","UHF broadcast spectrum","wireless broadband services","spectrum reallocation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936222","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910696/5936192/05936222.pdf","startPage":"32","endPage":"40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital switchover and regulatory design for competing white space usage rights","abstract":"There has been sustained regulatory support for the development and use of `white space' devices on UHF broadcast spectrum, particularly to provide wireless broadband services on a secondary or `unlicensed' basis. However, as regulators reallocate UHF spectrum released by the digital switchover to new services requiring a high degree of licence certainty (e.g. cellular networks) there will be incompatibilities between the rights of the new licensees and those of unlicensed white space users. What becomes of entrenched secondary usage rights if broadcast spectrum is reallocated to telecommunications and re-licensed on far more exclusive conditions than those currently prevailing for white space devices operating on a secondary basis to broadcasting services? Wide-spread deployment of white space devices could seriously complicate the reallocation of UHF band primary services from broadcasting to higher value users. This article considers Australian regulatory arrangements in light of this issue and suggests licensing reforms required to manage competing white space usage rights in the future.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936222/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5936222/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12086231","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Digital switchover and regulatory design for competing white space usage rights","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital switchover and regulatory design for competing white space usage rights","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"p32freyens.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032219S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910696","isNumber":"5936192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910696","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5936192","articleId":"5936222","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5936223,"authors":[{"name":"Timothy K.

License-exempt use can occur in traditional unlicensed bands or in secondary usage of white space spectrum. Various scenarios for license-exempt use are listed with a particular focus on spectrum access as a secondary user. Regulatory requirements devised by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for TV white space usage are described and tabulated. General principles and recommendations for license exempt spectrum usage are proposed with some important scenarios being identified. Additional requirements arise out of the need to share the spectrum with other potential users in a fair manner. System simulation results in an indoor setting are used to estimate spectral efficiencies under such conditions. We conclude that LTE can be used in license-exempt secondary usage scenario with only minor modifications, such as fair sharing procedures, and could benefit from support for higher order modulations.","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936224","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910696/5936192/05936224.pdf","startPage":"349","endPage":"358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"License-exempt LTE systems for secondary spectrum usage: Scenarios and first assessment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936224/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"License-exempt LTE systems for secondary spectrum usage: Scenarios and first assessment","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5936224/","accessionNumber":"12086233","publicationDate":"May 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"License-exempt LTE systems for secondary spectrum usage: Scenarios and first assessment","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"p349rahman.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086143S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910696","isNumber":"5936192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910696","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5936192","articleId":"5936224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5936227,"authors":[{"name":"Wessam Afifi","affiliation":["Wireless Intelligent Networks Center (WINC), Nile University, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Wessam","lastName":"Afifi","id":"37719725300"},{"name":"Ahmed Sultan","affiliation":["Wireless Intelligent Networks Center (WINC), Nile University, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Sultan","id":"37410033100"},{"name":"Mohammed Nafie","affiliation":["Wireless Intelligent Networks Center (WINC), Nile University, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Nafie","id":"37268935400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0178-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0177-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0176-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5936227","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":406},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936227","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Throughput","Radio transmitters","Receivers","Cognitive radio","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio spectrum management","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive sensing","transmission duration","cognitive radio","spectrum allocation","reliability-throughput tradeoff"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936227","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910696/5936192/05936227.pdf","startPage":"380","endPage":"388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive sensing and transmission durations for cognitive radios","abstract":"In a cognitive radio setting, secondary users opportunistically access the spectrum allocated to primary users. Finding the optimal sensing and transmission durations for the secondary users becomes crucial in order to maximize the secondary throughput while protecting the primary users from interference and service disruption. In this paper an adaptive sensing and transmission scheme for cognitive radios is proposed. We consider a channel allocated to a primary user which operates in an unslotted manner switching activity at random times. A secondary transmitter adapts its sensing and transmission durations according to its belief regarding the primary user state of activity. The objective is to maximize a secondary utility function. This function has a penalty term for collisions with primary transmission. It accounts for the reliability-throughput tradeoff by explicitly incorporating the impact of sensing duration on secondary throughput and primary activity detection reliability. It also accounts for throughput reduction that results from data overhead. Numerical simulations of the system performance demonstrate the effectiveness of adaptive sensing and transmission scheme over non-adaptive approach in increasing the secondary user utility.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936227/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12086236","publicationDate":"May 2011","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5936227/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive sensing and transmission durations for cognitive radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive sensing and transmission durations for cognitive radios","confLoc":"Aachen","sourcePdf":"p380afifi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080745S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910696","isNumber":"5936192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910696","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5936192","articleId":"5936227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":5936228,"authors":[{"name":"Marcin Parzy","affiliation":["Wireless Communications, Poznan University of Technology, Poznan, Poland"],"firstName":"Marcin","lastName":"Parzy","id":"38492788700"},{"name":"Hanna Bogucka","affiliation":["Wireless Communications, Poznan University of Technology, Poznan, Poland"],"firstName":"Hanna","lastName":"Bogucka","id":"37273442700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0178-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0177-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0176-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5936228","dbTime":"47 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":312},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Optimization","Resource management","TV","Mobile communication","White spaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer programming","radio spectrum management","resource allocation","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonidentical objects auction","spectrum sharing","TV white spaces","service provider","telecommunication operator","resource allocation problem","frequency domain","power domain","optimization problem","central trading entity","spectrum broker","branch and cut technique","integer programming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["spectrum broker","auction theory","spectrum sharing","TVWS"]}],"abstract":"The paper considers a new spectrum sharing approach in TV white spaces (TVWS) areas using an auction of non-identical objects taking the bandwidth and power requirements of the secondary users into account.

The resource allocation problem in frequency and power domain has been defined as an optimization problem where maximum payoff of the central trading entity (called spectrum broker) is the optimization goal. The problem of the best matching of the players demands, their bids and the auction solution to the available spectrum-holes have been discussed and highlighted. In the auction solution the branch and cut technique, known from integer programming, was applied so the complexity of the optimization algorithm was reduced significantly. Simulations results are also provided.","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936228","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910696/5936192/05936228.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936228","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","startPage":"389","endPage":"398","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-identical objects auction for spectrum sharing in TV white spaces \u2014 The perspective of service providers as secondary users","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936228","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Non-identical objects auction for spectrum sharing in TV white spaces \u2014 The perspective of service providers as secondary users","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936228/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5936228/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12086237","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-identical objects auction for spectrum sharing in TV white spaces \u2014 The perspective of service providers as secondary users","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"p389parzy.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059999S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910696","isNumber":"5936192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910696","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5936192","articleId":"5936228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5936233,"authors":[{"name":"Kristen Woyach","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Kristen","lastName":"Woyach","id":"37392017000"},{"name":"Anant Sahai","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Anant","lastName":"Sahai","id":"37266769200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0178-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0177-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0176-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5936233","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":193},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Interference","Performance evaluation","Cognitive radio","Humans","Law"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["caged cognitive radio","jail-based enforcement mechanism","human criminal justice system","singing sanction"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Why the caged cognitive radio sings","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936192","endPage":"442","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910696/5936192/05936233.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936233","startPage":"431","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936233","abstract":"In our earlier papers and, we have proposed a jail-based enforcement mechanism for cognitive radios inspired by the human criminal justice system. In the previous papers, we covered a throughput-greedy cognitive user, and in this paper, we extend those results to devices that care about energy, as well as mixed devices that care about both energy and time. We do this by introducing a `singing' sanction that forces devices to burn energy while they sit in jail. Through this exploration, we see a number of effects coming out: a homeband (which may be an unlicensed band) is required to present an alternative band to legally transmit in when it is difficult to operate legally in the cognitive band. Also, when the primary is very rarely active, it is practically impossible to deter cheating, so alternate policy decisions must be made for these cases. Finally, it is possible to create a singing plus jail sanction that is sufficient to deter bad behavior for all types of devices in all types of situations. But in order to enforce against everyone, while keeping overhead low, the rate of wrongful convictions must be kept small.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936233/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12086242","htmlLink":"/document/5936233/","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Why the caged cognitive radio sings","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Why the caged cognitive radio sings","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"p431woyach.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077316S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910696","isNumber":"5936192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910696","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5936192","articleId":"5936233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5936234,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid Reza Karimi","affiliation":["Office of Communications, London, UK"],"firstName":"Hamid Reza","lastName":"Karimi","id":"37271598300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0178-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0177-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0176-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5936234","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":792},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936234","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pixel","Receivers","Databases","Interference","Mathematical model","Geology","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital television","probability","radiofrequency interference","UHF radio propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geolocation database","white space device","UHF TV band","maximum permitted emission level","digital terrestrial TV","DTT band","DTT service location probability","national DTT network planning model","WSD regulatory emission limit","multiple DTT channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["White space devices","cognitive radios","geolocation database","interference","spectrum management","regulation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936234","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910696/5936192/05936234.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","startPage":"443","endPage":"454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Geolocation databases for white space devices in the UHF TV bands: Specification of maximum permitted emission levels","abstract":"In this paper we present the detailed calculations which a geolocation database would need to perform in order to derive location-specific maximum permitted emission levels for white space devices (WSDs) operating in digital terrestrial TV (DTT) bands.

Using an individual based simulation environment and a model of spectrum demand for the region of Portland, OR, we study a primary market to allocate spectrum licenses to wireless service providers. A truthful and efficient market clearing mechanism is used to sell the available licenses. A demand estimation model creates spatial and temporal demand estimates for each of the service providers. A valuation system determines the marginal value of each license which is further used in the bidding process. Three different scenarios are considered. First, the entire city of Portland is considered as one region and the estimated demand for this region is used to construct bids. The auction determines the clearing price for each license and the winner of the licenses based on the marginal valuations. After the market clearing is done and license allocations are made, we measure the total cost of licenses to the providers, the amount of unused capacity, and the number of unserved calls. In the second scenario, the city is divided into 2 regions in such a way that the number of call pairs are minimized across regions. Each region is auctioned separately. The providers can now decide their valuations sequentially for each region, so that they can use information on the allocations of the first region to optimally bid in the second region. The same set of measurements are taken again to understand the social impact of this scenario in comparison to the fist one. Finally a third scenario is run which is just like the second scenario but the city is now split into 2 regions in such a way that the call density and population is split evenly between regions. Results from the three scenarios are compared and analyzed to determine the impact of geographically complementary demand bids on the social cost and capacity used.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936235/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12086244","htmlLink":"/document/5936235/","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Impact of geographic complementarity in dynamic spectrum access","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of geographic complementarity in dynamic spectrum access","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"p455kim.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122425S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910696","isNumber":"5936192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910696","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5936192","articleId":"5936235","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5936237,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Networked Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405026000"},{"name":"Junaid Ansari","affiliation":["Institute of Networked Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Junaid","lastName":"Ansari","id":"37392126800"},{"name":"Guangwei Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Networked Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Guangwei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37712511300"},{"name":"Petri M\u00e4h\u00f6nen","affiliation":["Institute of Networked Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Petri","lastName":"M\u00e4h\u00f6nen","id":"37266541100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0178-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0177-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0176-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5936237","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":419},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media Access Protocol","Cognitive radio","Computer architecture","Hardware","Software","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cognitive radio","embedded systems","Linux","multi-threading","parallel processing","program compilers","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TRUMP","cognitive radio network","protocol stack","dynamic spectrum access","run-time performance optimization","PHY/MAC protocol","toolchain for run-time protocol","meta-language compiler","logic controller","optimizer","run-time realization","cognitive network protocol","communication capability","spectrum regulation","multithreading","multicore platform","parallelization","WARP SDR platform","embedded Linux based PC"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radios require fast reconfiguration of the protocol stack for dynamic spectrum access and run-time performance optimization.

The incumbent Primary User (PU) of the spectrum, with a weak transmission link, seeks cooperation from the cognitive Secondary User (SU) nodes in its vicinity, and in return rewards them with a suitable incentive. The incentive may be offered in terms of time (Cognitive Relaying with Time Incentive), frequency bands (Cognitive Relaying with Frequency Incentive), or both (Cognitive Relaying with Time and Frequency Incentive). Cross-layer optimization problems are formulated, which maximize the transmission opportunities for the SUs in the multi-hop multichannel relay network, and offer a guaranteed throughput to the PU. To make the SCR scheme practically realizable, a MAC scheduling protocol is proposed within a unified framework for both the PU and SUs. Furthermore, cross-layer formulations are also proposed for multiple SUs to efficiently access the Time or Frequency Incentive for their own communication. Simulation results are furnished for each of the proposed SCR schemes to demonstrate their effectiveness from the perspective of both the PU and SUs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936240/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12086249","htmlLink":"/document/5936240/","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"A cross-layer framework for symbiotic relaying in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cross-layer framework for symbiotic relaying in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"p498nadkar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.159825S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910696","isNumber":"5936192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910696","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5936192","articleId":"5936240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5936244,"authors":[{"name":"Yonghong Zeng","affiliation":["Institute of Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (ASTAR), Singapore"],"firstName":"Yonghong","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37271453200"},{"name":"Ying-Chang Liang","affiliation":["Institute of Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (ASTAR), Singapore"],"firstName":"Ying-Chang","lastName":"Liang","id":"37275171800"},{"name":"Meng Wah Chia","affiliation":["Institute of Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Meng Wah","lastName":"Chia","id":"37404449000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0178-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0177-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0176-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5936244","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":515},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936244","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Image edge detection","Wideband","Signal to noise ratio","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","performance evaluation","probability","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge based wideband sensing","cognitive radio","performance evaluation","wavelet transforms","power spectral density","PSD","multiband detection scheme","signal to noise ratio","SNR","false alarm probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","spectrum sensing","wideband sensing","multi-band sensing","subcarrier sensing","signal detection","edge detection","wavelet"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936244","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910696/5936192/05936244.pdf","startPage":"538","endPage":"544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Edge based wideband sensing for cognitive radio: Algorithm and performance evaluation","abstract":"Since a cognitive radio does not have fixed spectra, it may need to sense a very large frequency range to find an available band. The sensed aggregate bandwidth could be as large as several GHz. This is especially challenging if the center frequencies and bandwidths of the sensed signals are unknown and need to be detected. In this paper, an edge based wideband sensing is proposed. The method first uses the product of wavelet transforms at different scales to detect the edges (sharp changing points) of the power spectral density (PSD) of the received signal. It then forms the possible bands based on the detected edges. Thereafter, it applies a multi-band detection scheme to classify the bands as occupied or vacant. Finally, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of each occupied band is estimated. Performance evaluation is also a complicated issue for wideband sensing. Other than the conventional metrics as probability of detection and probability of false alarm, three new criteria are proposed to evaluate the performance of a wideband sensing. Simulations are provided to verify the methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936244/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12086253","publicationDate":"May 2011","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5936244/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Edge based wideband sensing for cognitive radio: Algorithm and performance evaluation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Edge based wideband sensing for cognitive radio: Algorithm and performance evaluation","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"p538zeng.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067587S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910696","isNumber":"5936192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910696","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5936192","articleId":"5936244","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5936245,"authors":[{"name":"Moslem Rashidi","affiliation":["Department of Signal and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Moslem","lastName":"Rashidi","id":"37601714100"},{"name":"Kasra Haghighi","affiliation":["Department of Signal and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Kasra","lastName":"Haghighi","id":"37534631600"},{"name":"Ashkan Panahi","affiliation":["Department of Signal and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ashkan","lastName":"Panahi","id":"37541082800"},{"name":"Mats Viberg","affiliation":["Department of Signal and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mats","lastName":"Viberg","id":"37268515700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0178-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0177-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0176-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5936245","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":376},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Wideband","Correlation","Signal to noise ratio","Cognitive radio","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","correlation methods","least squares approximations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NLLS","sub-Nyquist rate spectrum sensing","wideband cognitive radio","correlation matrix","nonlinear least square estimator","sequential forward selection algorithm","wideband multichannel signals"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A NLLS based sub-nyquist rate spectrum sensing for wideband cognitive radio","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936192","endPage":"551","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910696/5936192/05936245.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936245","startPage":"545","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936245","abstract":"For systems and devices, such as cognitive radio and networks, that need to be aware of available frequency bands, spectrum sensing has an important role. A major challenge in this area is the requirement of a high sampling rate in the sensing of a wideband signal. In this paper a wideband spectrum sensing method is presented that utilizes a sub-Nyquist sampling scheme to bring substantial savings in terms of the sampling rate. The correlation matrix of a finite number of noisy samples is computed and used by a non-linear least square (NLLS) estimator to detect the occupied and vacant channels of the spectrum. We provide an expression for the detection threshold as a function of sampling parameters and noise power. Also, a sequential forward selection algorithm is presented to find the occupied channels with low complexity. The method can be applied to both correlated and uncorrelated wideband multichannel signals. A comparison with conventional energy detection using Nyquist-rate sampling shows that the proposed scheme can yield similar performance for SNR above 4 dB with a factor of 3 smaller sampling rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936245/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12086254","htmlLink":"/document/5936245/","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"A NLLS based sub-nyquist rate spectrum sensing for wideband cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A NLLS based sub-nyquist rate spectrum sensing for wideband cognitive radio","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"p545rashidi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050495S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910696","isNumber":"5936192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910696","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5936192","articleId":"5936245","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5936246,"authors":[{"name":"Dola Saha","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Dola","lastName":"Saha","id":"37309406500"},{"name":"Aveek Dutta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Aveek","lastName":"Dutta","id":"37306666800"},{"name":"Dirk Grunwald","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Department of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Grunwald","id":"37270070800"},{"name":"Douglas Sicker","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Douglas","lastName":"Sicker","id":"37281826400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0178-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0177-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0176-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5936246","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":364},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Synchronization","Receivers","Cognitive radio","Correlation","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cognitive radio","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NC-OFDM","multiple noncontiguous band","narrowband channel","multiuser communication","noncontiguous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","medium access control layer design","MAC layer design","blind synchronization technique","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","wideband cognitive radio network","spectrum sharing"]}],"abstract":"Recent efforts in making licensed spectrum available for secondary use have opened up new opportunities and has redefined the meaning of sharing spectrum. Sharing spectrum requires aggregation of multiple non-contiguous bands of varying width to communicate as a network. Rather than limiting spectrum access to fixed width narrowband channels, they should be treated as conventions that are highly flexible and allow for simultaneous multi-user communication among a variety of heterogeneous devices with different transceiver capabilities. Non-Contiguous Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (NC-OFDM) is a physical layer technique that can be utilized to achieve this goal. Unlike the contiguous channelized access model, wideband non-contiguous access posses a critical challenge of synchronization. In this paper, we propose a practical algorithm and hardware implementation to overcome this challenge. Equipped with this blind synchronizer, we propose a Medium Access Control (MAC) layer design to enable flexible channel access while achieving co-existence with the incumbent and other secondary heterogeneous networks. The blind synchronization technique vastly simplifies channel rendezvous in the secondary network and provides faster migration to a vacant spectrum. Through extensive simulations under varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spectral occupancy, we show significant improvement over existing algorithms employed for NC-OFDM synchronization in cognitive radios and make wideband cognitive radio networks a distinct possibility in the near future.","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936246","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910696/5936192/05936246.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936192","startPage":"552","endPage":"563","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind synchronization for NC-OFDM \u2014 When \u201cchannels\u201d are conventions, not mandates","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936246","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Blind synchronization for NC-OFDM \u2014 When \u201cchannels\u201d are conventions, not mandates","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936246/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12086255","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5936246/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind synchronization for NC-OFDM \u2014 When \u201cchannels\u201d are conventions, not mandates","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"p552saha.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078342S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910696","isNumber":"5936192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910696","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5936192","articleId":"5936246","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5936247,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The transceiver consists of a Wavelet Packet Spectral Estimator (WPSE) and a Wavelet Packet Multi-carrier Modulator (WPM) both of which are implemented using filter banks. The WPSE estimates the radio environment and identifies spectrum holes and occupied bands. This information is then used to shape the time-frequency characteristics of the WPM transmission waveform in a way that the occupied bands are evaded. This is done by vacating those sub-carriers which lie in and around the occupied bands. The WPSE uses the same filter bank structure as used for WPM data modulation and hence doesn't add to the implementation costs. Through computer simulations the operation of the proposed system is demonstrated. The performances are also compared with two other candidate systems based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). The studies show that WPSE/WPM, in relation to FFT/OFDM, offers better bit-error-rate (BER) performance and bandwidth efficiency. This is facilitated by the excellent time-frequency localization of wavelet filters which results in better estimation of spectrum and spectral confinement of transmission waveform.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936192","startPage":"564","endPage":"575","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910696/5936192/05936247.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A reconfigurable wavelet packet filter bank transceiver for spectral analysis and dynamic spectrum access","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936247/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5936247/","displayDocTitle":"A reconfigurable wavelet packet filter bank transceiver for spectral analysis and dynamic spectrum access","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12086256","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A reconfigurable wavelet packet filter bank transceiver for spectral analysis and dynamic spectrum access","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"p564lakshmanan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073839S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910696","isNumber":"5936192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910696","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5936192","articleId":"5936247","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5936249,"authors":[{"name":"Dennis Wieruch","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute of Telecommunications, Heinrich-Hertz-Institute, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Dennis","lastName":"Wieruch","id":"37703950700"},{"name":"Volker Pohl","affiliation":["Institute of Theoretical Information Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Volker","lastName":"Pohl","id":"37278855900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0178-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0177-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0176-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5936249","dbTime":"31 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":343},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Signal processing","Reliability","Delay","Sensors","Hardware","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","cognitive radio","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio architecture","sub-Nyquist sampling","analog-to-digital converters","wide-band signals","digital signal processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","sub-Nyquist sampling"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A cognitive radio architecture based on sub-Nyquist sampling","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936192","endPage":"585","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910696/5936192/05936249.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936249","startPage":"576","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936249","abstract":"In this paper we discuss a cognitive radio architecture based on sub-Nyquist sampling scheme.

It integrates models of the channel, mobility, user preference, network operators (providers), infrastructure deployment, user distribution, and price-adaptation mechanisms. Providers aim to maximize their own profit, while clients decide based on criteria, such as the financial cost of the access, transmission rate, and required transmission power. This paper gives a brief description of the modelling framework and a novel price-adaptation algorithm for providers. It presents how this framework can be used to instantiate a cellular-based market in a small city.

However, in order for these approaches to be exploited requires in-depth understanding of the radio channel and traffic models in order that the most suitable resource sharing strategies are employed. This paper examines the exploitation of cognitive radio principles for delivery of IPTV content on demand within unmanaged wireless environments. This is particularly applicable within composite home wireless networks, but increasingly in other scenarios in which radio resources need to be shared in an autonomous and dynamic manner. The paper explores channel models, traffic models and presents some results from experimental implementation to learn the best channel selection strategies.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936192","startPage":"618","endPage":"622","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910696/5936192/05936256.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IPTV delivery using cognitive radio principles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936256/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5936256/","displayDocTitle":"IPTV delivery using cognitive radio principles","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12086265","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IPTV delivery using cognitive radio principles","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"p618farnham.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048874S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910696","isNumber":"5936192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910696","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5936192","articleId":"5936256","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5936260,"authors":[{"name":"Haichuan Zhou","affiliation":["ECIT, Queen''s University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Haichuan","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37405363600"},{"name":"Tharm Ratnarajah","affiliation":["ECIT, Queen''s University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Tharm","lastName":"Ratnarajah","id":"37065840000"},{"name":"Ying-Chang Liang","affiliation":["Institute of Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (ASTAR), Singapore"],"firstName":"Ying-Chang","lastName":"Liang","id":"37275171800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0178-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0177-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0176-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5936260","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":841},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Resource management","Cognitive radio","Antennas","Receivers","Optimization","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cognitive radio","gradient methods","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secondary network interference alignment","cognitive radio","CR network","primary user","secondary users","multiple antenna networks","power allocation","precoding vectors","gradient method"]}],"abstract":"We consider a peer-to-peer cognitive radio (CR) network with single primary user and multiple secondary users.

The proposed sensing policy employs secondary user (SU) collaboration through local interactions. The goal is to maximize the amount of available spectrum found for secondary use given a desired diversity order, i.e. a desired number of SUs sensing simultaneously each frequency band. The SUs in the cognitive radio network make local decisions based on their own and their neighbors' local test statistics or decisions to identify unused spectrum locally. Thus, the network builds a locally available map of spectrum occupancy of its geographical area. Simulation results show that the proposed sensing policy provides a significant increase in the amount of available spectrum found for secondary use compared to a random sensing policy.","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936261","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910696/5936192/05936261.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936261","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","startPage":"642","endPage":"646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reinforcement learning based distributed multiagent sensing policy for cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936261","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Reinforcement learning based distributed multiagent sensing policy for cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936261/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5936261/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12086270","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reinforcement learning based distributed multiagent sensing policy for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"p642lunden.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076057S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910696","isNumber":"5936192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910696","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5936192","articleId":"5936261","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5936262,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Due to high PAPR and power amplifier nonlinearity, it is typical to observe an increase in the out-of-band (OOB) interference caused by the OFDM transmissions and the bit-error rate at the receiver. The dynamic spectrum access system in this demonstration applies PAPR reduction to frequency-agile and bandwidth-adaptive OFDM transmissions, without sending any side information to the receivers. Partial transmission sequences (PTS) are adopted for PAPR reduction to be compatible with the cyclostationary signatures, embedded into OFDM waveforms for frequency acquisition and bandwidth estimation. In addition, by rotating the signal constellation properly, there is no need to send PTS-related side information to the receivers. The demonstration system is built upon the highly flexible Iris software radio platform, which is capable of providing the runtime reconfigurability needed.","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936268","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910696/5936192/05936268.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936192","startPage":"664","endPage":"665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Peak power reduction of flexible OFDM waveforms for cognitive radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936268","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Peak power reduction of flexible OFDM waveforms for cognitive radio","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936268/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12086277","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5936268/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Peak power reduction of flexible OFDM waveforms for cognitive radio","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"p664ozgul.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036924S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910696","isNumber":"5936192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910696","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5936192","articleId":"5936268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5936269,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

This is true especially in home networking where users are typically not networking professionals and cannot be expected to perform complex optimization and management tasks. In this context, cognitive radio concept combining cross-layer optimization and learning mechanisms is a promising solution. We demonstrate a cognitive home networking prototype, which addresses practical problems users face with the present-day wireless networks at home. The prototype shows how nodes using IEEE 802.11 radios and WARP boards operate under the Cognitive Resource Manager (CRM). The nodes achieve the desired performance by handling network dynamics and controlling parameters taking independent or cooperative decisions and operating in different layers of the protocol stack. This is done using multiple control loops which are supported by the CRM architecture. We demonstrate the use of machine learning for online estimation of network activity patterns to enable more efficient Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) using Hidden Semi-Markov Models (HSMM). The demonstration showcases dynamic spectrum allocation and policy-based behavioral changes in a home environment, where several multimedia streams and data communication flows are competing against each other and against external, also primary, interferers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936269/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12086278","publicationDate":"May 2011","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5936269/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Self-organizing home networking based on cognitive radio technologies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-organizing home networking based on cognitive radio technologies","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"p666wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084695S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910696","isNumber":"5936192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910696","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5936192","articleId":"5936269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5936270,"authors":[{"name":"Ruolin Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Wright State University, USA"],"firstName":"Ruolin","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37395119200"},{"name":"Xue Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Wright State University, USA"],"firstName":"Xue","lastName":"Li","id":"37406896700"},{"name":"Vasu Chakravarthy","affiliation":["Air Force Research Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Vasu","lastName":"Chakravarthy","id":"37287044500"},{"name":"Zhiqiang Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Wright State University, USA"],"firstName":"Zhiqiang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37291502200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0178-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0177-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0176-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5936270","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":358},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Sensors","Software","TV","Interference","Radio transmitters","Streaming media"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio spectrum management","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum mobility demonstration","SMSE based overlay cognitive radio","software defined radio","spectrum handoff","spectrum mobility feature","real time video streaming","cognitive radio nodes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936270","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936270","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","abstract":"We demonstrate spectrum handoff and spectrum mobility features of cognitive radio using software defined radio in this demo.

Contrary to common digital hardware realizations which use several image line long shift register pipelines for direct calculation of 2D neighborhood operations, we suggest an efficient cyclic image line storage structure by using dual port block RAM buffers, which are available in recent FPGAs. Therefore, our approach does not occupy a huge amount of valuable logic resources in the FPGA for shift registers based data storage and achieves a high data throughput by parallel video data processing paths. With this memory structure we realize - already principally proposed in a previous work - a new hardware architecture of the basic morphological image processing operations erosion and dilation as building blocks. With these building blocks, which are hardware occupation and maximum clock frequency efficient, we also implemented the combined morphological operations opening and closing, which are commonly used for image enhancement like noise reduction and object contour smoothing.","doi":"10.1109/RADIOELEK.2011.5936393","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 21st International Conference Radioelektronika 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 21st International Conference Radioelektronika 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5929231/5936384/05936393.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADIOELEK.2011.5936393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936384","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A real time video processing framework for hardware realization of neighborhood operations with FPGAs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936393","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A real time video processing framework for hardware realization of neighborhood operations with FPGAs","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936393/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-20 April 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12086449","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5936393/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A real time video processing framework for hardware realization of neighborhood operations with FPGAs","confLoc":"Brno, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044993S","chronDate":"19-20 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5929231","isNumber":"5936384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5929231","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5936384","articleId":"5936393","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5936400,"authors":[{"name":"Emad Ebrahimi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Emad","lastName":"Ebrahimi","id":"37582300700"},{"name":"Sasan Naseh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Sasan","lastName":"Naseh","id":"37282595800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-324-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-325-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-323-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5936400","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":296},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design automation","Phase noise","Genetic algorithms","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Power demand","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CAD","CMOS integrated circuits","genetic algorithms","integrated circuit noise","phase noise","SPICE","UHF integrated circuits","voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-coupled CMOS LC-VCO","parasitic-aware LC-VCO optimizer CAD tool","elitist nondominated sorting genetic algorithm","power consumption","phase noise","harmonic balance analysis","HSPICE RF","MATLAB","RF-CMOS technology","size 0.18 mum","frequency 2.4 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CAD Tool","genetic algorithm","LC voltage-controlled oscillator (LC-VCO)","NSGA-II","Phase noise"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936400","abstract":"A fast simulation-based and parasitic-aware LC-VCO optimizer CAD tool, using Elitist Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) is presented.

Among many other reasons, it follows from great flexibility as well as competitive computational requirements of the FDTD method when compared to other numerical modeling methods. Nevertheless, market demands are always well ahead of the current computational horizons of the classic FDTD method, prompting development of semi-analytical numerical methods that enable modeling of the most challenging electromagnetic (EM) applications. As an example of those continuing trends, we will recall semi-analytical FDTD solutions for axisymmetrical and periodic structures, both widely addressed in the literature and solvable by the commercial EM simulation tools. It will be shown that a tremendous cut of required computational resources is achievable when the FDTD method is supported by appropriate analytical solutions. Several application examples, like cylindrical corrugated horn antenna, Cassegrain reflectors, photonic crystals and micro-structured telecommunications fibers, will be presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-analytical FDTD modeling of axisymmetrical and periodic structures","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 21st International Conference Radioelektronika

Especially after the 2004 development of its High Profile (HP), it has become one of the primary formats in HDTV content delivery. In January 2010, a joint Call for Proposals (CfP) on video compression technology has been issued by ISO/IEC MPEG and ITU-T VCEG, targeting at a new generation of video compression technology with a substantially higher compression capability than H.264/AVC. As a response to this CfP, Fraunhofer HHI proposed a newly developed video coding scheme which achieves bit rate savings of around 30% when compared to H.264/AVC HP. This paper describes the proposed video coding scheme and discusses its innovative features.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Highly efficient video coding based on quadtree structures, improved motion compensation, and probability interval partitioning entropy coding","publicationTitle":"2011 14th ITG Conference on Electronic Media Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 14th ITG Conference on Electronic Media Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5914473/5936533/05936548.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936533","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936548","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936548/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-24 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"Highly efficient video coding based on quadtree structures, improved motion compensation, and probability interval partitioning entropy coding","conferenceDate":"23-24 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5936548/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"12086342","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly efficient video coding based on quadtree structures, improved motion compensation, and probability interval partitioning entropy coding","confLoc":"Dortmund, Germany","sourcePdf":"13WinkenFraunhoferHHI.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076226S","chronDate":"23-24 March 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5914473","isNumber":"5936533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5914473","xplore-issue":"5936533","articleId":"5936548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Informatik Centrum Dortmund","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5936614,"authors":[{"name":"Sung-Tae An","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-Tae","lastName":"An","id":"37713894200"},{"name":"Jeong-Jung Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jeong-Jung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37293469100"},{"name":"Joon-Woo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Joon-Woo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37406245200"},{"name":"Ju-Jang Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ju-Jang","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280306200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0872-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0871-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0870-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-4938"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-4946"}],"articleNumber":"5936614","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":322},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","Gaussian processes","image classification","object detection","particle swarm optimisation","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human detection","Gaussian particle swarm optimization","histograms of oriented gradients feature","linear-SVM classifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pedestrian Detection","Human Detection","Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG)","Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)","Gaussian-PSO"]}],"abstract":"Human detection is a challenging task in many fields because it is difficult to detect humans due to their varying appearance and posture. The evaluation speed of the method is important as well as its accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel method using Gaussian Particle Swarm Optimization (Gaussian-PSO) for human detection with the Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature to achieve a fast and accurate performance. Keeping the robustness of HOG feature on human detection, we raise the process speed in detection process so that it can be used for real-time applications. These advantages are given by a simple process which needs only one linear-SVM classifier with HOG features and Gaussian-PSO procedure.","doi":"10.1109/DEST.2011.5936614","publicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Conference on Digital Ecosystems and Technologies (IEEE DEST 2011)","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Conference on Digital Ecosystems and Technologies (IEEE DEST 2011)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5902073/5936563/05936614.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DEST.2011.5936614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936563","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast human detection using Gaussian Particle Swarm Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936614","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2011-June 3 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936614/","displayDocTitle":"Fast human detection using Gaussian Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12130984","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5936614/","conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast human detection using Gaussian Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"TD001437FastHumanDetectionUsingGaussianPartic.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037194S","chronDate":"May 31 2011-June 3 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5902073","isNumber":"5936563","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5902073","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5936563","articleId":"5936614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-09"},{"_id":5936620,"authors":[{"name":"Han Me Kim","affiliation":["Environmental and Energy Research Division, Korea Institute of Machinery & Materials, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Han Me","lastName":"Kim","id":"37716234500"},{"name":"Kyoung Taik Park","affiliation":["Nano Fusion System Research Division, Korea Institute of Machinery & Materials, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyoung Taik","lastName":"Park","id":"37293450700"},{"name":"Seock Joon Kim","affiliation":["Environmental and Energy Research Division, Korea Institute of Machinery & Materials, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seock Joon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37069748500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0872-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0871-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0870-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-4938"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-4946"}],"articleNumber":"5936620","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936620","abstract":"This paper deals with adaptive back-stepping position control system with FNNs(fuzzy neural networks) algorithm for servo system with system uncertainty.

The flow is applicable on gate-level netlists, where back-annotated toggle information is used to find the minimum energy operation point, corresponding maximum clock frequency, as well as the dissipated energy per clock cycle. The application of the model is demonstrated by exploring the energy efficiency of pipelining, retiming, and register balancing. Simulation results, which are obtained during a fraction of SPICE simulation time, are validated by measurements on a wavelet-based cardiac event detector that was fabricated in 65-nm low-leakage high-threshold technology. The mean of the absolute modeling error is calculated as 5.2%, with a standard deviation of 6.6% over the measurement points. The cardiac event detector dissipates 0.88 pJ/sample at a supply voltage of 320 mV.","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2011.2157505","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4156126/6138606/05936651.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2011.2157505","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6138606","startPage":"15","endPage":"27","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Level Energy Estimation in the Sub-V- Domain: Simulation and Measurement of a Cardiac Event Detector","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936651","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-Level Energy Estimation in the Sub-V<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$_{{\\rm T}}$</tex></formula> Domain: Simulation and Measurement of a Cardiac Event Detector","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936651/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12487889","pubMedId":"23852741","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5936651/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Level Energy Estimation in the Sub-V<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$_{{\\rm T}}$</tex></formula> Domain: Simulation and Measurement of a Cardiac Event Detector","sourcePdf":"tbcas-akgun-2157505-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070627S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"6138606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6138606","articleId":"5936651","onlineDate":"30 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5936652,"authors":[{"name":"Nguyen Trong Tai","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Nguyen Trong","lastName":"Tai","id":"37595172100"},{"name":"Kyoung Kwan Ahn","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyoung Kwan","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37302333500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6536"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0865"},{"format":"CD","value":"2374-0159"}],"articleNumber":"5936652","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":934},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Actuators","Mathematical model","Hysteresis","Artificial neural networks","Kalman filters","Output feedback","Resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","adaptive control","feedback","Kalman filters","radial basis function networks","shape memory effects","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["output feedback direct adaptive controller","SMA actuator","Kalman filter","shape memory alloy","feedback linearization method","radial basis function neural network","RBFNN","proportional-integral-derivative controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Direct adaptive control (DAC)","hysteresis","Kalman filter","radial basis function neural network (RBFNN)","shape memory alloy (SMA)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936652","abstract":"In this brief, a direct adaptive controller (DAC) is proposed to control a shape memory alloy (SMA) actuator. The DAC, with its advantages in parameter tuning and noise robustness, was successfully applied to control an SMA actuator. The control signal in DAC was derived via a feedback linearization method. A radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) was then employed to approximate the control signal due to the system nonlinearity and parameter uncertainties. The weighting factors of the RBFNN are updated on the condition of system stability. Due to the system states requirement of the DAC and measurement noise, a Kalman filter was introduced in this work to eliminate the output measurement noise and estimate the system states. From the simulation and experimental results, it was verified that the DAC controller with the Kalman filter was successfully applied to a SMA actuator and the hysteresis phenomenon was almost compensated. The experimental control results were also compared with those of a conventional proportional-integral-derivative controller.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2011.2158435","startPage":"1081","endPage":"1091","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2011.2158435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6203515","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/6203515/05936652.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Output Feedback Direct Adaptive Controller for a SMA Actuator With a Kalman Filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936652/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Output Feedback Direct Adaptive Controller for a SMA Actuator With a Kalman Filter","volume":"20","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5936652/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12853066","publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"22 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Output Feedback Direct Adaptive Controller for a SMA Actuator With a Kalman Filter","sourcePdf":"tcst-ahn-2158435-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064149S","chronDate":"July  2012","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"6203515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6203515","articleId":"5936652","onlineDate":"30 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5936663,"authors":[{"name":"Jinil Lee","affiliation":["Semiconductor Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jinil","lastName":"Lee","id":"38195697000"},{"name":"Sunglae Cho","affiliation":["Semiconductor Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sunglae","lastName":"Cho","id":"38184583600"},{"name":"Dongho Ahn","affiliation":["Semiconductor Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dongho","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37307608700"},{"name":"Mansug Kang","affiliation":["Semiconductor Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Mansug","lastName":"Kang","id":"38559935000"},{"name":"Seokwoo Nam","affiliation":["Semiconductor Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seokwoo","lastName":"Nam","id":"37418181200"},{"name":"Ho-Kyu Kang","affiliation":["Semiconductor Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ho-Kyu","lastName":"Kang","id":"37278424500"},{"name":"Chilhee Chung","affiliation":["Semiconductor Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chilhee","lastName":"Chung","id":"37276896400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"5936663","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":718},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936663","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase change random access memory","Bismuth","Crystallization","Phase change materials","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bismuth compounds","chemical vapour deposition","crystallisation","germanium compounds","phase change memories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-performance phase-change random access memory","scalable PRAM device","CVD GeBiTe","chemical-vapor-deposited GeBiTe","GBT crystallization","dynamic RAM","storage class memory","GeBiTe"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Crystallization speed","endurance","GeBiTe (GBT)","phase-change random access memory (PRAM)"]}],"abstract":"We first present chemical-vapor-deposited GeBiTe (CVD GBT) in a confined cell for high-performance phase-change random access memory (PRAM).

The ICA unsupervised learning procedure attempts to demix the observation vectors and identify the salient features or mixture sources. This work presents a novel contrast function for evaluating the dependence among sources. A convex divergence measure is developed by applying the convex functions to the Jensen's inequality. Adjustable with a convexity parameter, this inequality-based divergence measure has a wide range of the steepest descents to reach its minimum value. A convex divergence ICA (C-ICA) is constructed and a nonparametric C-ICA algorithm is derived with different convexity parameters where the non-Gaussianity of source signals is characterized by the Parzen window-based distribution. Experimental results indicate that the specialized C-ICA significantly reduces the number of learning epochs during estimation of the demixing matrix. The convergence speed is improved by using the scaled natural gradient algorithm. Experiments on the BSS of instantaneous, noisy and convolutive mixtures of speech and music signals further demonstrate the superiority of the proposed C-ICA to JADE, Fast-ICA, and the nonparametric ICA based on mutual information.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2011.2161080","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/6066252/05936672.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2011.2161080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6066252","startPage":"302","endPage":"313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convex Divergence ICA for Blind Source Separation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936672","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Convex Divergence ICA for Blind Source Separation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936672/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12339980","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5936672/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convex Divergence ICA for Blind Source Separation","sourcePdf":"tasl-chienge-2161080-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080397S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6066252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6066252","articleId":"5936672","onlineDate":"30 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5936714,"authors":[{"name":"Youssef Ounejjar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, \u00c9cole De Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6191366/5936714/5936714-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Youssef Ounejjar (M'09) was born in Meknes, Morocco, in 1971.

Apart from lack of efficiency and increased cost and weight of the transformer, one of the reasons is the dc input current that causes transformer saturation. The purpose of this paper is the development of a finite-element computational tool that is going to aid transformer manufacturers in designing distribution transformers specifically for the renewable-energy market. It is based on a generalized macroscopic representation of electrical steels used in the transformer manufacturing industry that enables the accurate evaluation of electromagnetic field distribution of transformer cores under heavily saturated conditions. Its advantages over conventional formulations include numerical stability, numerical accuracy, and reduction of iterations of the Newton-Raphson method. An experimental verification of the proposed method is carried out.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Transformers Working Under Heavily Saturated Conditions in Grid-Connected Renewable-Energy Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2161068","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6142654/05936721.pdf","startPage":"2342","endPage":"2350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2161068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142654","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936721","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936721/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Transformers Working Under Heavily Saturated Conditions in Grid-Connected Renewable-Energy Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5936721/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12508902","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Transformers Working Under Heavily Saturated Conditions in Grid-Connected Renewable-Energy Systems","sourcePdf":"tie-kefalas-2161068-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085875S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6142654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6142654","articleId":"5936721","onlineDate":"30 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5936723,"authors":[{"name":"Majid Pahlevaninezhad","affiliation":["Queens Centre of Energy and Power Electronics Research, Queens University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6046172/5936723/5936723-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Majid Pahlevaninezhad (S'07) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran, in 2002 and 2004, respectively.

The proposed dc/dc converter is used as a battery charger for an electric vehicle (EV). Since this application demands a wide range of load variations, the converter should be able to sustain ZVS from full-load to no-load condition. The converter employs an asymmetric auxiliary circuit to provide the reactive current for the full-bridge semiconductor switches, which guarantees ZVS at turn-on times. The proposed control scheme is able to determine the optimum value of the reactive current injected by the auxiliary circuit in order to minimize extra conduction losses in the power MOSFETs, as well as the losses in the auxiliary circuit. In the proposed approach, the peak value of the reactive current is controlled by controlling the switching frequency to make sure that there is enough current to charge and discharge the snubber capacitors during the deadtime. In addition, some practical issues of this application (battery charger for an EV) are discussed in this paper. Experimental results for a 2-kW dc/dc converter are presented. The results show an improvement in efficiency and better performance of the converter.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2161063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6046172","startPage":"920","endPage":"933","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6046172/05936723.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Load Adaptive Control Approach for a Zero-Voltage-Switching DC/DC Converter Used for Electric Vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936723/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5936723/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Load Adaptive Control Approach for a Zero-Voltage-Switching DC/DC Converter Used for Electric Vehicles","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12300518","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Load Adaptive Control Approach for a Zero-Voltage-Switching DC/DC Converter Used for Electric Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tie-pahlevaninezhad-2161063-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090457S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6046172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"155","xplore-issue":"6046172","articleId":"5936723","onlineDate":"30 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5936724,"authors":[{"name":"Jiancheng Fang","affiliation":["School of Instrumentation Science and Optoelectronics Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6046172/5936724/5936724-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jiancheng Fang was born in September 1965.

Furthermore, the design is validated with experimental results on a fabricated machine and is found to suit the design requirements of critical spacecraft applications.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2161058","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6180074/05936725.pdf","startPage":"3553","endPage":"3560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6180074","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2161058","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Slotless Halbach-Array Permanent-Magnet Brushless DC Motor for Spacecraft Applications","volume":"59","issue":"9","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5936725/","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"12656119","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936725/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Slotless Halbach-Array Permanent-Magnet Brushless DC Motor for Spacecraft Applications","sourcePdf":"tie-praveen-2161058-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061516S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6180074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6180074","articleId":"5936725","onlineDate":"30 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-20"},{"_id":5936727,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-Lin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6142654/5936727/5936727-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiao-Lin Wang was born in Sichuan, China, in 1976.

The perception and understanding of an image is modeled as an active inference process, in which the brain tries to explain the scene using an internal generative model. The psychovisual quality is thus closely related to how accurately visual sensory data can be explained by the generative model, and the upper bound of the discrepancy between the image signal and its best internal description is given by the free energy of the cognition process. Therefore, the perceptual quality of an image can be quantified using the free energy. Constructively, we develop a reduced-reference free-energy-based distortion metric (FEDM) and a no-reference free-energy-based quality metric (NFEQM). The FEDM and the NFEQM are nearly invariant to many global systematic deviations in geometry and illumination that hardly affect visual quality, for which existing image quality metrics wrongly predict severe quality degradation. Although with very limited or even without information on the reference image, the FEDM and the NFEQM are highly competitive compared with the full-reference SSIM image quality metric on images in the popular LIVE database. Moreover, FEDM and NFEQM can measure correctly the visual quality of some model-based image processing algorithms, for which the competing metrics often contradict with viewers' opinions.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2011.2161092","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6106034/05936730.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2011.2161092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6106034","startPage":"41","endPage":"52","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Psychovisual Quality Metric in Free-Energy Principle","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936730","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Psychovisual Quality Metric in Free-Energy Principle","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936730/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12425596","pubMedId":"21724508","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5936730/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Psychovisual Quality Metric in Free-Energy Principle","sourcePdf":"tip-yang-2161092-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101878S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6106034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"175","xplore-issue":"6106034","articleId":"5936730","onlineDate":"30 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5936731,"authors":[{"name":"Tuvi Etzion","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Tuvi Etzion (M'89\u2013SM'94\u2013F'04) was born in Tel Aviv, Israel, in 1956.

Small errors always exist in link length and link twist for physical manipulators, which affect the precision in kinematic equations leading to calculate wrong joint angle values in inverse kinematic equations. In order to solve these problems, the proposed technique employs a structured laser module (SLM), a stationary camera, the Jacobian matrices, and an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The SLM is attached to the end-effector of the manipulator arm and the stationary camera is used to determine an accurate position where the laser comes out. Variances between actual and measured positions of laser beams are represented by the Jacobian matrices formulated from differential kinematics. Then, the EKF is used to estimate kinematic parameters. Effectiveness of the proposed technique is verified with 7 DOF humanoid manipulator arm by computer simulation and 4 DOF manipulator by actual experiment.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2011.2158234","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/6287065/05936736.pdf","startPage":"1059","endPage":"1067","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2011.2158234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Laser-Based Kinematic Calibration of Robot Manipulator Using Differential Kinematics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936736/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Laser-Based Kinematic Calibration of Robot Manipulator Using Differential Kinematics","volume":"17","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12961020","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5936736/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Laser-Based Kinematic Calibration of Robot Manipulator Using Differential Kinematics","sourcePdf":"tmech-kim-2158234-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074584S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6287065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"6287065","articleId":"5936736","onlineDate":"30 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5936794,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas A.

After some manipulation, standard optimization techniques determine the trade-off between the amount of packet-level erasure coding and physical-layer channel coding that minimizes the transmit power required to provide reliable communication. Our results indicate that the optimal combination of packet-level erasure coding and physical-layer coding provides a significant benefit over pure physical-layer coding when no form of channel diversity is present within a packet transmission. However, the benefit of including packet-level erasure coding diminishes as more diversity becomes available within a packet transmission. Even with no diversity within a packet transmission, this paper shows that as the total redundancy becomes large the optimal redundancy for packet-level erasure coding reaches a limit while the optimal redundancy for physical-layer coding continues to increase. Hence providing limitless redundancy at the packet-level with rateless codes such as fountain codes is not the best use of limitless redundancy for block-fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.062311.090277","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5986797/05936794.pdf","startPage":"2101","endPage":"2109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.062311.090277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5986797","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Allocation of Redundancy Between Packet-Level Erasure Coding and Physical-Layer Channel Coding in Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936794","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936794/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Allocation of Redundancy Between Packet-Level Erasure Coding and Physical-Layer Channel Coding in Fading Channels","volume":"59","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12206217","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5936794/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Allocation of Redundancy Between Packet-Level Erasure Coding and Physical-Layer Channel Coding in Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"2101-tc1108-courtade.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07315S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5986797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5986797","articleId":"5936794","onlineDate":"30 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5936795,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi D.

This receiver structure is employed as the nonlinear pre-processor prior to the conventional low-speed photodetector. In our performance evaluation amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) of the optical amplifiers, receiver front end thermal noise and photodetector shot noise which are effective in low power conditions, and multiple access interference (MAI) noise which is the dominant source of noise in high power conditions in any coherent OCDMA communications system have been considered. We begin by studying the statistical behavior of Thick crystals in an optically amplified digital lightwave communication system in the context of a SPE-OCDMA communication system. The error probability for Thick crystal receiver structure is evaluated using Saddle-Point approximation. Furthermore, we obtain a closed form approximation for the probability density function (pdf) of the decision variable in SPE-OCDMA systems with Thin crystal SHG receiver. In this analysis, to obtain approximate probability density function, we employ Gram-Charlier expansion based on the corresponding first order moments of the decision variable. The first three moments are obtained in a closed form approximation and consequently a closed form expression for the error probability is obtained by integrating the approximated pdf of the decision variables for transmitting bit \"1\" and \"0\" in Thin crystal receiver structure. The precision of the approximation is verified by the Monte-Carlo simulation. Finally the performance of SPE-OCDMA network for both Thin and Thick SHG crystals are analytically evaluated and discussed for different number of interfering users and different code-lengths and different speed of the conventional photodetectors. We deduce that the performance of Thin SHG crystal receiver is more sensitive to the transmitted power level especially in low power conditions. It is concluded that in low power conditions where ASE, thermal and shot noises are the dominant noise sources, Thick SHG crystal receiver outperforms the Thin crystal receiver. However, in high power conditions where MAI noise is the most effective noise term, Thin SHG crystal receiver structure outperforms the Thick crystal receiver.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Characterization of Ultrahigh SpeedOptically Amplified Spectral-Phase EncodedOCDMA Systems with Second-Harmonic-Generation Effect in Thin and Thick Crystal Receiver Structures","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.062311.090573","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6062271/05936795.pdf","startPage":"2818","endPage":"2831","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.062311.090573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062271","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936795","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936795/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance Characterization of Ultrahigh SpeedOptically Amplified Spectral-Phase EncodedOCDMA Systems with Second-Harmonic-Generation Effect in Thin and Thick Crystal Receiver Structures","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5936795/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","publicationDate":"October 2011","accessionNumber":"12317734","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Characterization of Ultrahigh SpeedOptically Amplified Spectral-Phase EncodedOCDMA Systems with Second-Harmonic-Generation Effect in Thin and Thick Crystal Receiver Structures","sourcePdf":"2818-tc1110-matinfar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106874S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6062271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6062271","articleId":"5936795","onlineDate":"30 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5936797,"authors":[{"name":"Walid Saad","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6020878/5936797/5936797-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Walid Saad received his B.E. degree in computer and communications engineering from Lebanese University, Faculty of Engineering II, in 2004, his M.E.

This paper presents, using game theory, a novel approach for the formation of the tree architecture that connects the RSs and their serving base station in the uplink of the next generation wireless multi-hop systems. Unlike existing literature which mainly focused on performance analysis, we propose a distributed algorithm for studying the structure and dynamics of the network. We formulate a network formation game among the RSs whereby each RS aims to maximize a cross-layer utility function that takes into account the benefit from cooperative transmission, in terms of reduced bit error rate, and the costs in terms of the delay due to multi-hop transmission. For forming the tree structure, a distributed myopic algorithm is devised. Using the proposed algorithm, each RS can individually select the path that connects it to the BS through other RSs while optimizing its utility. We show the convergence of the algorithm into a Nash tree network, and we study how the RSs can adapt the network's topology to environmental changes such as mobility or the deployment of new mobile stations. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm presents significant gains in terms of average utility per mobile station which is at least 17.1% better relatively to the case with no RSs and reaches up to 40.3% improvement compared to a nearest neighbor algorithm (for a network with 10 RSs). The results also show that the average number of hops does not exceed 3 even for a network with up to 25 RSs.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.062311.100046","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6020878/05936797.pdf","startPage":"2528","endPage":"2542","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.062311.100046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6020878","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network Formation Games Among Relay Stations in Next Generation Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5936797","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5936797/","displayDocTitle":"Network Formation Games Among Relay Stations in Next Generation Wireless Networks","volume":"59","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 2011","accessionNumber":"12228300","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5936797/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network Formation Games Among Relay Stations in Next Generation Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"2528-tc1109-saad.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116032S","chronDate":"September  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6020878","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6020878","articleId":"5936797","onlineDate":"30 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5936799,"authors":[{"name":"Kasun T.

The second result implies that we may not be able to take advantage of the diversity gain in practice due to the high SNR requirements.

The proposed control method is to regulate the axial transport velocity of the membrane so as to track a desired profile according to which the vibration energy of the membrane at the end of transport decays most quickly. An optimal control problem that generates the desired profile of the axial transport velocity is solved by the conjugate gradient method. The Galerkin method is applied in order to reduce the partial differential equations describing the dynamics of the axially moving membrane into two sets of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) representing longitudinal/lateral and transverse displacements. For control design purposes, these ODEs are rewritten into state-space equations. The vibration energy of the axially moving membrane is represented by a quadratic form of the state variables. In the optimal control problem, the cost function modified from the vibration energy function is subject to the constraints on the state variables, and the axial transport velocity is considered as a control input. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is illustrated via numerical simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transverse Vibration Control of Axially Moving Membranes by Regulation of Axial Velocity","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2011.2159384","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/6203515/05937027.pdf","startPage":"1124","endPage":"1131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2011.2159384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6203515","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937027","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937027/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 July 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2012","displayDocTitle":"Transverse Vibration Control of Axially Moving Membranes by Regulation of Axial Velocity","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5937027/","dateOfInsertion":"22 May 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12853070","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transverse Vibration Control of Axially Moving Membranes by Regulation of Axial Velocity","sourcePdf":"tcst-hong-2159384-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127996S","chronDate":"July  2012","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"6203515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"6203515","articleId":"5937027","onlineDate":"05 July 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":5937028,"authors":[{"name":"Yair Linn","affiliation":["PMC-Sierra, Burnaby, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Yair Linn (M'01) received the B.Sc. degree (with honors) in computer engineering from the Technion\u2014Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel, in 1996, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of British Columbia (UBC), Vancouver, BC, Canada, in 2007.","From 1996 to 2001, he was an Electrical Engineer with the Israeli Ministry of Defense, where he worked with the development, implementation, and deployment of wireless communications systems.

The total cost of the laboratory is under USD $200, but it includes complete transmission, channel emulation, reception (coherent and noncoherent), and probing capabilities. Over 15 different modulation types are currently supported. The laboratory, aimed primarily to serve as a teaching aid for a professor teaching senior undergraduate courses and projects, allows students to have visual real-time demonstrations in wireless communications systems. The laboratory is also powerful enough to allow experienced researchers to carry out wireless communications research projects. In this context, the laboratory is particularly useful for universities in developing countries, where budgets are extremely limited. Numerical and written survey results are presented that were collected from two classes of students taught by the author in a university in Colombia, South America, and which show the effectiveness of the laboratory in teaching wireless communications.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TE.2011.2158318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6193254","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","pdfPath":"/iel5/13/6193254/05937028.pdf","endPage":"179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Ultra Low Cost Wireless Communications Laboratory for Education and Research","doi":"10.1109/TE.2011.2158318","startPage":"169","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937028","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"An Ultra Low Cost Wireless Communications Laboratory for Education and Research","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937028/","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2012","accessionNumber":"12694936","publicationDate":"May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5937028/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Ultra Low Cost Wireless Communications Laboratory for Education and Research","sourcePdf":"te-linn-2158318-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103492S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"13","isNumber":"6193254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"13","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6193254","articleId":"5937028","onlineDate":"05 July 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5937030,"authors":[{"name":"Manuele Bertoluzzo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/5977191/5937030/5937030-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Manuele Bertoluzzo received the M.S. degree in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree in industrial electronics and computer science from the University of Padova, Padova, Italy, in 1993 and 1997, respectively.","From 1998 to 2000, he was a member of the Research and Development Division of an electric drive factory.

Although the outperformance of JGGA has been demonstrated by some detailed statistical analyses based on numerical simulations, more rigorous theoretical justification is still in vain. In this paper, a mathematical model based on schema is derived. It then provides theoretical justifications on why JGGA is superiority in searching, particularly when it is applied to solve multiobjective optimization problems. The studies are also further verified by solving some optimization problems and comparisons are made between different optimization algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2011.2158842","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/5977191/05937032.pdf","startPage":"408","endPage":"418","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2011.2158842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5977191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Theoretical Development and Analysis of Jumping Gene Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937032/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Theoretical Development and Analysis of Jumping Gene Genetic Algorithm","volume":"7","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12205603","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5937032/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Theoretical Development and Analysis of Jumping Gene Genetic Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tii-tang-2158842-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102408S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"5977191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5977191","articleId":"5937032","onlineDate":"05 July 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5937042,"authors":[{"name":"R.

FPGA-based configurable processors offer a low-cost, fast turnaround, and versatile design and implementation platform for this challenging task. This paper presents an introductory embedded systems design course that integrates configurable processors, FPGAs, and multiprocessor design and implementation. We emphasize hands-on hardware-software codesign skills by a series of carefully designed tutorials, lab assignments, and a comprehensive project on the Altera DE2 FPGA development board. Developing and teaching such a new course with no appropriate textbook available is quite challenging.

Often, mass-spring system is used to reduce such vibrations. The mass-spring system can either serve as absorbers or dampers. Usually, such system is tuned to absorb or damp a single frequency of excitation or resonance frequency respectively. However, ability to vary the absorber's natural frequency would allow broadband vibration absorption. In this paper, an Active Mass Damper (AMD) is presented to eliminate broadband vibration. The lowest frequencies are the main interest as they cause larger displacement. The AMD is tuned actively to match the first three resonance frequencies of a three story building model thus making it effective for a broadband vibration control. The tuning of AMD's natural frequency is done using piezoelectric patch that effectively change its stiffness. Simulation studies on the performances of the AMD are shown. The optimal location of the AMD is also identified. The findings of this study shows reduction in all response of the individual floors at the resonance frequencies.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOM.2011.5937112","publicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Mechatronics (ICOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Mechatronics (ICOM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5903341/5937111/05937112.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/ICOM.2011.5937112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and development of an Active Mass Damper for broadband vibration control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Design and development of an Active Mass Damper for broadband vibration control","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5937112/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12094311","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937112/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and development of an Active Mass Damper for broadband vibration control","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"100C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047075S","chronDate":"17-19 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5903341","isNumber":"5937111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5903341","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5937111","articleId":"5937112","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5937116,"authors":[{"name":"Humaid AlShu'eili","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Advanced Technology, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Humaid","lastName":"AlShu'eili","id":"37706832900"},{"name":"Gourab Sen Gupta","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Advanced Technology, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Gourab Sen","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37273199600"},{"name":"Subhas Mukhopadhyay","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Advanced Technology, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Subhas","lastName":"Mukhopadhyay","id":"37291471300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-437-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-435-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-436-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5937116","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":3977},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Home automation","Home appliances","Zigbee","Speech","Microphones","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential pulse code modulation","home automation","speech recognition","Zigbee"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voice recognition based wireless home automation system","voice commands","low-power RF ZigBee wireless communication modules","verification tests","voice recognition response test","DPCM","differential pulse code modulation","speech signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Home automation","ZigBee transceivers","voice streaming","ADC","Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM)","voice recognition"]}],"abstract":"Home Automation industry is growing rapidly; this is fuelled by the need to provide supporting systems for the elderly and the disabled, especially those who live alone.

This paper details the overall design of a wireless home automation system (WHAS) which has been built and implemented. The automation centres on recognition of voice commands and uses low-power RF ZigBee wireless communication modules which are relatively cheap. The home automation system is intended to control all lights and electrical appliances in a home or office using voice commands. The system has been tested and verified. The verification tests included voice recognition response test, indoor ZigBee communication test, and the compression and decompression tests of DPCM (Differential Pulse Code Modulation) speech signals. The tests involved a mix of 35 male and female subjects with different English accents. 35 different voice commands were sent by each person. Thus the test involved sending a total of 1225 commands and 79.8% of these commands were recognised correctly.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voice recognition based wireless home automation system","publicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Mechatronics (ICOM)","doi":"10.1109/ICOM.2011.5937116","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Mechatronics (ICOM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5903341/5937111/05937116.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOM.2011.5937116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937111","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937116","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937116/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Voice recognition based wireless home automation system","conferenceDate":"17-19 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5937116/","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12094315","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voice recognition based wireless home automation system","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"106C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040526S","chronDate":"17-19 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5903341","isNumber":"5937111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5903341","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5937111","articleId":"5937116","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5937117,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this paper several closed loop power control algorithms are analyzed considering loop delay to cope with random changes of the radio channel and interference. Adaptive algorithms are considered that utilize ideas from self-tuning control systems. The inherent loop delay associated with closed loop power control can be included in the design process. Another problem in closed-loop power control is that extensive control signaling consumes radio resources, and thus the control feedback bandwidth must be limited. To enhance the performance of closed-loop power control in limited-feedback-case is investigated. The performances of the adaptive algorithms are investigated through both analysis and computer simulations, and compared with well-known algorithms from the literature. After proper investigation and analysis it is anticipated that significant performance improvements are achievable with the adaptive algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICOM.2011.5937117","publicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Mechatronics (ICOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Mechatronics (ICOM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5903341/5937111/05937117.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOM.2011.5937117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of power control schemes in CDMA communication system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937117","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937117/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of power control schemes in CDMA communication system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12094316","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5937117/","conferenceDate":"17-19 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of power control schemes in CDMA communication system","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"111C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060621S","chronDate":"17-19 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5903341","isNumber":"5937111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5903341","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5937111","articleId":"5937117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5937121,"authors":[{"name":"Suriza Ahmad Zabidi","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering Dept, International Islamic University Malaysia, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Suriza Ahmad","lastName":"Zabidi","id":"37547499500"},{"name":"Md.

Technologically, FSO is similar to communication using fiber optic cables. Since the two technologies are similar, they share the same advantages such as higher speed, unlimited bandwidth and protocol independent. However, in term of cost and time for deployment, the cost to deploy FSO is cheaper and the deployment time is shorter since no cable is needed for FSO so the time and cost is reduce significantly. Although FSO has all the advantages of the best quality as communication medium, local weather condition is the drawback of FSO link performance. The aim of this paper is to investigate on this limitation with the focus on atmospheric attenuation on the propagation of FSO signal. General atmospheric attenuation will be discussed and the focus will be on rain. The motivation of this is to develop attenuation model that best represent tropical weather condition.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Mechatronics (ICOM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5903341/5937111/05937121.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Mechatronics (ICOM)","doi":"10.1109/ICOM.2011.5937121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOM.2011.5937121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937111","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigating of rain attenuation impact on Free Space Optics propagation in tropical region","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rain","Attenuation","Scattering","Atmospheric modeling","Atmospheric waves"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric optics","light absorption","light propagation","optical communication","rain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rain attenuation impact","free space optics propagation","tropical region","fiber optic cables","communication medium","FSO link performance","attenuation model","tropical weather condition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Free Space Optics","FSO","Environmental Impact","Propagation","Attenuation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937121/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Investigating of rain attenuation impact on Free Space Optics propagation in tropical region","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5937121/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12094320","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","conferenceDate":"17-19 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigating of rain attenuation impact on Free Space Optics propagation in tropical region","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"119C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05091S","chronDate":"17-19 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5903341","isNumber":"5937111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5903341","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5937111","articleId":"5937121","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5937130,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Compressive sensing is a new paradigm of acquiring signals, fundamentally different from uniform rate digitization followed by compression, often used for transmission or storage. In this paper, a novel algorithm for speech coding utilizing CS principle is developed. The sparsity of speech signals is exploited using gammatone filterbank and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) in which the compressive sensing principle is then applied to the sparse subband signals. All parameters will be optimized using informal listening test and Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ). In order to further reduce the bit requirement, vector quantization using codebook of the training signals will be added to the system. The performance of overall algorithms will be evaluated based on the processing time and speech quality. Finally, to speed up the process, the proposed algorithm will be implemented in a multicore system, i.e. six cores, using Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) parallel paradigm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Mechatronics (ICOM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5903341/5937111/05937130.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Mechatronics (ICOM)","doi":"10.1109/ICOM.2011.5937130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOM.2011.5937130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937111","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speech compression using compressive sensing on a multicore system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Compressed sensing","Multicore processing","Speech coding","Speech processing","Discrete cosine transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","data compression","discrete cosine transforms","microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems","signal reconstruction","speech coding","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech compression","compressive sensing","multicore system","speech signal sparsity","speech coding","gammatone filter bank","discrete cosine transform","sparse subband signals","informal listening test","perceptual evaluation of speech quality","vector quantization","codebook","training signals","single program multiple data parallel paradigm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing","speech coding","PESQ","listening test","multicore system","SPMD"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937130/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Speech compression using compressive sensing on a multicore system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5937130/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12094328","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","conferenceDate":"17-19 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech compression using compressive sensing on a multicore system","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"134C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065111S","chronDate":"17-19 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5903341","isNumber":"5937111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5903341","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5937111","articleId":"5937130","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5937131,"authors":[{"name":"R.

These images are watermarked in order to proof its integrity; not modified by unauthorized person, and to ascertain the authenticity, that is, ensuring that the image belong to the correct patient and emanates from the correct source. However, the current problem with the watermarking system used for medical images is distortion introduced during the patient data/information embedding. This factor has hindered proper detection and treatment. This paper proposed a distortion free algorithm based on Fast Fourier Transform and Complex Valued Neural Network (FFT-CVNN) that can be used for watermarking medical images. The qualities of the images were evaluated with both pixel and perceptual-based metrics. Results indicate that the host image and the watermarked image were perceptually indistinguishable and the tamper detector was able to detect any form of forgery or tampering in the watermarked image.","doi":"10.1109/ICOM.2011.5937131","publicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Mechatronics (ICOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Mechatronics (ICOM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5903341/5937111/05937131.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOM.2011.5937131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of alterations in watermarked medical images using Fast Fourier Transform and Complex-Valued Neural Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937131","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937131/","displayDocTitle":"Detection of alterations in watermarked medical images using Fast Fourier Transform and Complex-Valued Neural Network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12094329","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5937131/","conferenceDate":"17-19 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of alterations in watermarked medical images using Fast Fourier Transform and Complex-Valued Neural Network","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"137C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066186S","chronDate":"17-19 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5903341","isNumber":"5937111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5903341","xplore-issue":"5937111","articleId":"5937131","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5937135,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

This biosignal can be employed in various applications including diagnoses of neuromuscular diseases, controlling assistive devices like prosthetic/orthotic devices, controlling machines, robots, computer etc. EMG signal based reliable and efficient hand gesture identification can help to develop good human computer interface which in turn will increase the quality of life of the disabled or aged people. The purpose of this paper is to describe the process of detecting different predefined hand gestures (left, right, up and down) using artificial neural network (ANN). ANNs are particularly useful for complex pattern recognition and classification tasks. The capability of learning from examples, the ability to reproduce arbitrary non-linear functions of input, and the highly parallel and regular structure of ANNs make them especially suitable for pattern recognition tasks. The EMG pattern signatures are extracted from the signals for each movement and then ANN utilized to classify the EMG signals based on features. A back-propagation (BP) network with Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm has been used for the detection of gesture. The conventional and most effective time and time-frequency based features (namely MAV, RMS, VAR, SD, ZC, SSC and WL) have been chosen to train the neural network.","doi":"10.1109/ICOM.2011.5937135","publicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Mechatronics (ICOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Mechatronics (ICOM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5903341/5937111/05937135.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOM.2011.5937135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937111","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electromygraphy (EMG) signal based hand gesture recognition using artificial neural network (ANN)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937135","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Electromygraphy (EMG) signal based hand gesture recognition using artificial neural network (ANN)","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937135/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12094333","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5937135/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electromygraphy (EMG) signal based hand gesture recognition using artificial neural network (ANN)","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"150C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061545S","chronDate":"17-19 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5903341","isNumber":"5937111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5903341","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"5937111","articleId":"5937135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5937140,"authors":[{"name":"Wajdi Al-Khateeb","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, International Islamic University Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Wajdi","lastName":"Al-Khateeb","id":"37547499700"},{"name":"Md Rafiqul Islam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, International Islamic University Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Md Rafiqul","lastName":"Islam","id":"38184422700"},{"name":"Myat Tun Oo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, International Islamic University Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Myat Tun","lastName":"Oo","id":"38359801400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-437-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-435-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-436-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5937140","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":289},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rain","Attenuation","Optical fiber communication","Optical receivers","Integrated optics","Optical attenuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["attenuation measurement","intensity measurement","optical links","rain","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rain fade analysis","free space optic link","FSO communication systems","line-of-sight terrestrial link","rain fall intensity measurement","Kuala Lumpur campus","rain fall intensity meter","ITU-R rain attenuation prediction model","rain attenuation measurement","microwave link","distance 800 m"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FSO","Aailability prediction","Rain intensity"]}],"abstract":"Attenuation due to rainfall can severely degrade the FSO links operating under tropical weather.

While many techniques are available for capturing the I/O behavior of individual application trial runs and specific components of the storage system, continuous characterization of a production system remains a daunting challenge for systems with hundreds of thousands of compute cores and multiple petabytes of storage. As a result, these storage systems are often designed without a clear understanding of the diverse computational science workloads they will support.In this study, we outline a methodology for scalable, con tinuous, systemwide I/O characterization that combines storage device instrumentation, static file system analysis, and a new mechanism for capturing detailed application-level behavior. This methodology allows us to quantify systemwide trends such as the way application behavior changes with job size, the \"burstiness\" of the storage system, and the evolution of file system contents over time. The data also can be examined by application domain to determine the most prolific storage users and also investigate how their I/O strategies correlate with I/O performance. At the most detailed level, our characterization methodology can also be used to focus on individual applications and guide tuning efforts for those applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology by performing a multilevel, two-month study of Intrepid, a 557 teraflop IBM Blue Gene/P system. During that time, we captured application-level I/O characterizations from 6,481 unique jobs spanning 38 science and engineering projects with up to 163,840 processes per job. We also captured patterns of I/O activity in over 8 petabytes of block device traffic and summarized the con tents of file systems containing over 191 million flies. We then used the results of our study to tune example applications, highlight trends that impact the design of future storage systems, and identify opportunities for improvement in I/O characterization methodology.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding and improving computational science storage access through continuous characterization","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 27th Symposium on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST)","doi":"10.1109/MSST.2011.5937212","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 27th Symposium on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910685/5937211/05937212.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"14","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSST.2011.5937212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937211","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937212","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937212/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Understanding and improving computational science storage access through continuous characterization","conferenceDate":"23-27 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5937212/","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12094433","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding and improving computational science storage access through continuous characterization","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"01CarnsHABLLRUnderstandingComputationalScienceStor.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100838S","chronDate":"23-27 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910685","isNumber":"5937211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910685","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"5937211","articleId":"5937212","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5937213,"authors":[{"name":"H.

An accurate performance model will not only help understand the state-of-the-art of SSDs, but also provide the research tools for exploring the design space of such storage systems. Although over the years many performance models were developed for hard drives, the architectural differences between two device families prevent these models from being effective for SSDs. The hard drive performance models cannot account for several unique characteristics of SSDs, e.g., low latency, slow update, and expensive block-level erase. In this paper, we utilize the black-box modeling approach to analyze and evaluate SSD performance, including latency, bandwidth, and throughput, as it requires minimal a priori information about the storage devices. We construct the black-box models, using both synthetic workloads and real-world traces, on three SSDs, as well as an SSD RAID. We find that, while the black-box approach may produce less desirable performance predictions for hard disks, a black-box SSD model with a comprehensive set of workload characteristics can produce accurate predictions for latency, bandwidth, and throughput with small errors.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 27th Symposium on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910685/5937211/05937213.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 27th Symposium on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST)","doi":"10.1109/MSST.2011.5937213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSST.2011.5937213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937211","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance modeling and analysis of flash-based storage devices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance evaluation","Bandwidth","Throughput","Ash","Predictive models","Hard disks","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["disc drives","flash memories","hard discs","performance evaluation","RAID"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash-based storage device performance analysis","flash-based storage device performance modeling","flash-based solid-state drives","hard drive","SSD performance evaluation","minimal a priori information","synthetic workloads","SSD RAID","hard disks","black-box SSD model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937213/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance modeling and analysis of flash-based storage devices","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5937213/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12094434","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","conferenceDate":"23-27 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance modeling and analysis of flash-based storage devices","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"02HuangLSTPerformanceModeling.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113985S","chronDate":"23-27 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910685","isNumber":"5937211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910685","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5937211","articleId":"5937213","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5937215,"authors":[{"name":"Song Jiang","affiliation":["ECE Department, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37279383900"},{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Lei Zhang","id":"37280173600"},{"name":"XinHao Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"XinHao Yuan","id":"37714314600"},{"name":"Hao Hu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Hao Hu","id":"37715340800"},{"name":"Yu Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yu Chen","id":"37293319100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0428-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0427-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-195X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1968"}],"articleNumber":"5937215","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1068},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ash","Hard disks","Random access memory","Throughput","Writing","Prefetching","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","DRAM chips","flash memories","logic circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["S-FTL","logical-to-physical address translation","flash memory","spatial locality","solid-state disk","random access patterns","DRAM cache","MLC NAND","cache space","flash translation layer","mapping table size reduction","sequential writes","clustered access","sparse writes","in-cache address translation"]}],"abstract":"The solid-state disk (SSD) is becoming increasingly popular, especially among users whose workloads exhibit substantial random access patterns. As SSD competes with the hard disk, whose per-GB cost keeps dramatically falling, the SSD must retain its performance advantages even with low-cost configurations, such as those with a small built-in DRAM cache for mapping table and using MLC NAND. To this end, we need to make the limited cache space efficiently used to support fast logical-to-physical address translation in the flash translation layer (FTL) with minimal access of flash memory and minimal merge operations. Existing schemes usually require a large number of overhead accesses, either for accessing uncached entries of the mapping table or for the merge operation, and achieve suboptimal performance when the cache space is limited. In this paper we take into account spatial locality exhibited in the workloads to obtain a highly efficient FTL even with a relatively small cache, named as S-FTL. Specifically, we identify three access patterns related to spatial locality, including sequential writes, clustered access, and sparse writes. Accordingly we propose designs to take advantage of these patterns to reduce mapping table size, increase hit ratio for in-cache address translation, and minimize expensive writes to flash memory. We have conducted extensive trace-driven simulations to evaluate S-FTL and compared it with other state-of-the-art FTL schemes. Our experiments show that S-FTL can reduce accesses to the flash for address translation by up to 70% and reduce response time of SSD by up to 25%, compared with the state-of-the-art FTL strategies such as FAST and DFTL.","doi":"10.1109/MSST.2011.5937215","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 27th Symposium on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 27th Symposium on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910685/5937211/05937215.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSST.2011.5937215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"S-FTL: An efficient address translation for flash memory by exploiting spatial locality","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"S-FTL: An efficient address translation for flash memory by exploiting spatial locality","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937215/","publicationDate":"May 2011","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12094436","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5937215/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 May 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"S-FTL: An efficient address translation for flash memory by exploiting spatial locality","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"04JiangZYHCSFTLAdresstranslation.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049817S","chronDate":"23-27 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910685","isNumber":"5937211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910685","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5937211","articleId":"5937215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5937216,"authors":[{"name":"Dongchul Park","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Dongchul","lastName":"Park","id":"37711805900"},{"name":"David H.C.

Particularly in flash memory, it has a critical impact on its performance (due to a garbage collection) as well as its life span (due to a wear leveling). Although the hot data identification is an issue of paramount importance in flash memory, little investigation has been made. Moreover, all existing schemes focus almost exclusively on a frequency viewpoint. However, recency also must be considered equally with the frequency for effective hot data identification. In this paper, we propose a novel hot data identification scheme adopting multiple bloom filters to efficiently capture finer-grained recency as well as frequency. In addition to this scheme, we propose a Window-based Direct Address Counting (WDAC) algorithm to approximate an ideal hot data identification as our baseline. Unlike the existing baseline algorithm that cannot appropriately capture recency information due to its exponential batch decay, our WDAC algorithm, using a sliding window concept, can capture very fine-grained recency information. Our experimental evaluation with diverse realistic workloads including real SSD traces demonstrates that our multiple bloom filter-based scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art scheme. In particular, ours not only consumes 50% less memory and requires less computational overhead up to 58%, but also improves its performance up to 65%.","doi":"10.1109/MSST.2011.5937216","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 27th Symposium on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 27th Symposium on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910685/5937211/05937216.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSST.2011.5937216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hot data identification for flash-based storage systems using multiple bloom filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937216","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Hot data identification for flash-based storage systems using multiple bloom filters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937216/","publicationDate":"May 2011","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12094437","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5937216/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 May 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hot data identification for flash-based storage systems using multiple bloom filters","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"05ParkDHotDataIdentification.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088796S","chronDate":"23-27 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910685","isNumber":"5937211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910685","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"5937211","articleId":"5937216","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5937219,"authors":[{"name":"Yangwook Kang","affiliation":["Storage Systems Research Center, University of California, Santa Cruz, USA"],"firstName":"Yangwook","lastName":"Kang","id":"37713307000"},{"name":"Jingpei Yang","affiliation":["Storage Systems Research Center, University of California, Santa Cruz, USA"],"lastName":"Jingpei Yang","id":"37716105200"},{"name":"Ethan L.

To alleviate this problem and fully utilize different characteristics of SCMs, we propose the use of an object-based model that provides the hardware and firmware the ability to optimize performance for the underlying implementation, and allows drop-in replacement for devices based on new types of SCM.

However the endurance of flash memory is still a critical issue in using it for large scale enterprise applications. Rethinking the basic design of NAND flash memory is essential to realize its maximum potential in large scale storage. NAND flash memory is organized as blocks and blocks in turn have pages. A block can be erased reliably only for a limited number of times and frequent block erase operations to a few blocks reduce the lifetime of the flash memory. Wear leveling helps to prevent the early wear out of blocks in the flash memory. In order to achieve efficient wear leveling, data is moved around throughout the flash memory. The existing wear leveling algorithms do not scale for large scale NAND flash based SSDs. In this paper we propose a static wear leveling algorithm, named as Rejuvenator, for large scale NAND flash memory. Rejuvenator is adaptive to the changes in workloads and minimizes the cost of expensive data migrations. Our evaluation of Rejuvenator is based on detailed simulations with large scale enterprise workloads and synthetic micro benchmarks.","doi":"10.1109/MSST.2011.5937225","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 27th Symposium on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 27th Symposium on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910685/5937211/05937225.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSST.2011.5937225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rejuvenator: A static wear leveling algorithm for NAND flash memory with minimized overhead","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937225","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Rejuvenator: A static wear leveling algorithm for NAND flash memory with minimized overhead","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937225/","publicationDate":"May 2011","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12094446","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5937225/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 May 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rejuvenator: A static wear leveling algorithm for NAND flash memory with minimized overhead","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"14MuruganDRejuvenator.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083695S","chronDate":"23-27 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910685","isNumber":"5937211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910685","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"5937211","articleId":"5937225","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5937228,"authors":[{"name":"Biplob Debnath","affiliation":["EMC Corporation, Santa Clara, USA"],"firstName":"Biplob","lastName":"Debnath","id":"37550769300"},{"name":"Srinivasan Krishnan","affiliation":["Amazon.com, Inc., Seattle, USA"],"firstName":"Srinivasan","lastName":"Krishnan","id":"37712075100"},{"name":"Weijun Xiao","affiliation":["University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA"],"firstName":"Weijun","lastName":"Xiao","id":"38525872400"},{"name":"David J.

The score for a block is estimated using metadata information such as age, block utilization, and erase count. To quickly find a victim block, these algorithms maintain a priority queue in the SRAM of the storage controller. This priority queue takes O(K) space, where K stands for flash storage capacity in total number of blocks. As the flash capacity scales to larger size, K also scales to larger value. However, due to higher price per byte, SRAM will not scale proportionately. In this case, due to SRAM scarcity, it will be challenging to implement a larger priority queue in the limited SRAM of a large-capacity flash storage. In addition to space issue, with any update in the metadata information, the priority queue needs to be continuously updated, which takes O(lg(K)) operations. This computation overhead also increases with the increase of flash capacity. In this paper, we have taken a novel approach to solve the garbage collection metadata management problem of a large-capacity flash storage. We propose a sampling-based approach to approximate existing garbage collection algorithms in the limited SRAM space. Since these algorithms are heuristic-based, our sampling-based algorithm will perform as good as unsampled (original) algorithm, if we choose good samples to make garbage collection decisions. We propose a very simple policy to choose samples. Our experimental results show that small number of samples are good enough to emulate existing garbage collection algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/MSST.2011.5937228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSST.2011.5937228","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 27th Symposium on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910685/5937211/05937228.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 27th Symposium on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling-based garbage collection metadata management scheme for flash-based storage","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Sampling-based garbage collection metadata management scheme for flash-based storage","conferenceDate":"23-27 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5937228/","accessionNumber":"12094449","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937228/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling-based garbage collection metadata management scheme for flash-based storage","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"17DebnathKXLDSamplingbasedGarbagecollection.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052304S","chronDate":"23-27 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910685","isNumber":"5937211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910685","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5937211","articleId":"5937228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5937258,"authors":[{"name":"R.

We first describe the principle of waveform design for ultrawideband (UWB) impulse waveforms and present the signal model and the advantages of a UWB-throb signal. The ambiguity function of the UWB-throb signal for monostatic radar is derived in detail and analyzed by computer simulation to show its capabilities for enhanced radar performance in terms of target detection, resolution, accuracy of range and velocity measurements, and clutter suppression. The resolution theory for bistatic radar using UWB-throb signal is also presented. The dependence of delay and Doppler shift, associated with a moving target, on the parameters that constitute the geometry of bistatic radar is formulated and used to obtain the bistatic ambiguity function of the UWB-throb signal. Computer simulation plots are generated that clearly illustrate the effects of change in radar-target geometry on the overall characteristics of the bistatic ambiguity function. The computer plots of the monostatic and the bistatic ambiguity functions of the UWB-throb signal demonstrate that such signal can achieve the \"thumbtack ambiguity function,\" that is desirable for the numerous applications of UWB-impulse radar.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/5937244/05937260.pdf","startPage":"1710","endPage":"1722","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2011.5937260","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2011.5937260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937244","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ambiguity Functions for Monostatic and Bistatic Radar Systems using UWB Throb Signal","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bistatic radar","Geometry","Chirp","Doppler effect","Delay","Object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clutter","Doppler shift","object detection","radar imaging","ultra wideband radar","velocity measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ambiguity functions","monostatic radar systems","bistatic radar systems","UWB throb signal","target detection","velocity measurements","clutter suppression","delay dependence","Doppler shift","radar-target geometry","UWB-impulse radar"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937260/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Ambiguity Functions for Monostatic and Bistatic Radar Systems using UWB Throb Signal","volume":"47","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5937260/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12141496","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ambiguity Functions for Monostatic and Bistatic Radar Systems using UWB Throb Signal","sourcePdf":"47aes03-Hussain.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124411S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"5937244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5937244","articleId":"5937260","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5937263,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The proposed spatial CS (SCS) approach allows exploitation of the array orientation diversity (achievable via array dynamics) in the CS framework to address challenging array signal processing problems such as left-right ambiguity and poor estimation performance at endfire. The SCS is conceptually different from well-known classical and subspace-based methods because it provides high azimuth resolution using a short dynamic linear array without restricting requirements on the spatial and temporal stationarity and correlation properties of the sources and the noise.

However, this technique cannot provide satisfactory association performance in tracking with a ground moving target indicator (GMTI) radar ground moving targets employing evasive move-stop-move maneuvers. To avoid detection by a GMTI radar, targets can deliberately stop for some time before moving again. Since a GMTI radar does not detect a target when the radial velocity (along the line-of-sight from the sensor) falls below a certain minimum detectable velocity (MDV), the move-stop-move maneuvers of the targets usually lead to broken tracks as a result. We present a new TSA technique which employs a dummy track to formulate a complete association. By using an interacting multiple model (IMM) estimator with state-dependent mode transition probabilities (IMM-SDP) for track segment prediction (forward and backward), the proposed algorithm can effectively stitch both \"regular\" broken tracks and broken tracks due to targets' move-stop-move maneuvers. Comparisons are given to show the advantages of the proposed algorithm in broken tracks reduction and track continuity improvement.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2011.5937272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2011.5937272","startPage":"1899","endPage":"1914","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/5937244/05937272.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Track Segment Association for GMTI Tracks of Evasive Move-Stop-Move Maneuvering Targets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 July 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"Track Segment Association for GMTI Tracks of Evasive Move-Stop-Move Maneuvering Targets","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","volume":"47","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5937272/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937272/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Track Segment Association for GMTI Tracks of Evasive Move-Stop-Move Maneuvering Targets","sourcePdf":"47aes03-Zhang1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083875S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"5937244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5937244","articleId":"5937272","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5937277,"authors":[{"name":"Matt S.

Specifically, the nearly orthogonal waveforms from chaotic systems are shown to possess many desirable radar properties including a compact spectrum, low range sidelobes, and an average transmit power within a few dB of peak power. Moreover, these waveforms can be generated at essentially any practical time length and bandwidth. Since these waveforms are generated from a deterministic process, each waveform can be represented with a small number of system parameters. Additionally, assuming these waveforms possess a large time-bandwidth product, a high number of nearly orthogonal chaotic waveforms exist for a given time and bandwidth. Thus the proposed generation procedure can potentially be used to generate a new transmit waveform on each pulse.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quasi-Orthogonal Wideband Radar Waveforms Based on Chaotic Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2011.5937277","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/5937244/05937277.pdf","startPage":"1974","endPage":"1984","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2011.5937277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937244","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937277","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937277/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 July 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"Quasi-Orthogonal Wideband Radar Waveforms Based on Chaotic Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5937277/","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12141512","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quasi-Orthogonal Wideband Radar Waveforms Based on Chaotic Systems","sourcePdf":"47aes03-Willsey.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055133S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"5937244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5937244","articleId":"5937277","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5937283,"authors":[{"name":"Pengcheng Zhan","affiliation":["Quantenna Communications, Inc., Fremont, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/5937244/5937283/5937283-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pengcheng Zhan received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, in 2007.","From 2008\u20132010, he was employed at ArrayComm, LLC, San Jos\u00e9, CA, where he worked on multi-antenna signal processing for wireless communications.

We develop an algorithm for optimizing the performance of the ground-to-relay links through control of the UAV heading angle. To quantify link performance, we define the ergodic normalized transmission rate (ENTR) for the links between the ground nodes and the relay, and derive a closed-form expression for it in terms of the eigenvalues of the channel correlation matrix. We show that the ENTR can be approximated as a sinusoid with an offset that depends on the heading of the UAV. Using this observation, we develop a closed-form expression for the UAV heading that maximizes the uplink network data rate while keeping the rate of each individual link above a certain threshold. When the current UAV relay assignments cannot meet the minimum link requirements, we investigate the deployment and heading control problem for new UAV relays as they are added to the network, and propose a smart handoff algorithm that updates node and relay assignments as the topology of the network evolves.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2011.5937283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2011.5937283","startPage":"2068","endPage":"2085","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/5937244/05937283.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Relay Communications with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: Performance and Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937283/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Relay Communications with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: Performance and Optimization","volume":"47","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12141516","publicationDate":"July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5937283/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Relay Communications with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: Performance and Optimization","sourcePdf":"47aes03-Zhan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077178S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"5937244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"219","xplore-issue":"5937244","articleId":"5937283","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5937285,"authors":[{"name":"Rong Yang","affiliation":["CFL/IE/INFO, DSO National Laboratories, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/5937244/5937285/5937285-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rong Yang received her B.E. degree in information and control from Xi'an Jiao Tong University, China, in 1986, and M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the National University of Singapore in 2000.","She is currently a senior member of technical staff at DSO National Laboratories.

An antenna system with unknown bias is deployed in the RF receiver to find the target direction of arrival (DOA) or bearing. This problem is conventionally solved by two separate stages, namely, to estimate target bearings through a relative amplitude direction finding (DF) algorithm, and to find the emitter location from the estimated bearings. The drawback of such a structure is that it is difficult to identify antenna bias through the DF algorithm alone, and the bearing error caused by antenna bias can significantly decrease the localization accuracy, especially when a target is located in longer range. To overcome this drawback, we merge the two stages together to formulate the localization problem as a discrete dynamic estimation problem. Thus, the target location and the antenna bias can be estimated simultaneously. Two algorithms are developed to cope with the merged system. The first algorithm, which is named as A-UKF, uses an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to estimate the target location and the antenna bias in an augmented state. The second algorithm called MM-UKF further improves the A-UKF by introducing a multiple model (MM) approach to overcome the problem caused by an inaccurate initial state. The inaccurate initial state can seriously affect the performance of subsequent nonlinear estimation. The results show that both proposed algorithms are obviously superior to the conventional two-stage localization algorithm, and the MM-UKF algorithm outperforms the A-UKF.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937285/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5937285/","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12141518","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"47","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"RF Emitter Geolocation using Amplitude Comparison with Auto-Calibrated Relative Antenna Gains","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RF Emitter Geolocation using Amplitude Comparison with Auto-Calibrated Relative Antenna Gains","sourcePdf":"47aes03-Yang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0654S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"5937244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5937244","articleId":"5937285","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5937292,"authors":[{"name":"Murat Akcakaya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University of Saint Louis, Saint Louis, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Murat","lastName":"Akcakaya","id":"37712516200"},{"name":"Arye Nehorai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University of Saint Louis, Saint Louis, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Arye","lastName":"Nehorai","id":"37265777100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9251"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9603"},{"format":"CD","value":"2371-9877"}],"articleNumber":"5937292","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":942},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Aerospace &amp; Electronic Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-aess.org/default.php"}],"abstract":"Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radars with widely separated transmitters and receivers are useful to discriminate a target from clutter using the spatial diversity of the scatterers in the illuminated scene. We consider the detection of targets in compound-Gaussian clutter, describing heavy-tailed clutter distributions fitting high-resolution and/or low-grazing-angle radars in the presence of sea or foliage clutter. First we introduce a data model using the inverse gamma distribution to represent the clutter texture. Then we apply the parameter-expanded expectation-maximization (PX-EM) algorithm to estimate the clutter texture and speckle as well as the target parameters. We develop a statistical decision test using these estimates and demonstrate its statistical characteristics. Based on the statistical characteristics of this test, we propose an algorithm to adaptively distribute the transmitted energy among the transmitters and maximize the detection performance. We demonstrate the advantages of the MIMO setup and adaptive energy allocation in target detection in the presence of compound-Gaussian clutter using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/5937244/05937292.pdf","startPage":"2200","endPage":"2207","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2011.5937292","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2011.5937292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937244","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive MIMO Radar Design and Detection in Compound-Gaussian Clutter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clutter","Transmitters","Receivers","Radar cross section","Maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gamma distribution","MIMO radar","radar clutter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive MIMO radar design","compound-Gaussian clutter","multiple-input multiple-output radars","heavy-tailed clutter distributions","data model","inverse gamma distribution","clutter texture","parameter-expanded expectation-maximization algorithm","statistical decision test","statistical characteristics","adaptive energy allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937292/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive MIMO Radar Design and Detection in Compound-Gaussian Clutter","volume":"47","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5937292/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12141523","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive MIMO Radar Design and Detection in Compound-Gaussian Clutter","sourcePdf":"47aes03-Akcakaya-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079042S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"5937244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5937244","articleId":"5937292","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5937294,"authors":[{"name":"Guangliang Ren","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, School of Telecommunication Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Guangliang","lastName":"Ren","id":"37280950700"},{"name":"Chuiqiang Sun","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, School of Telecommunication Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Chuiqiang","lastName":"Sun","id":"37715039600"},{"name":"Hao Ni","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, School of Telecommunication Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Ni","id":"37661607800"},{"name":"Yun Bai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, School of Telecommunication Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Bai","id":"37712096400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9251"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9603"},{"format":"CD","value":"2371-9877"}],"articleNumber":"5937294","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":643},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Aerospace &amp; Electronic Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-aess.org/default.php"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distance measurement","OFDM","Estimation","Accuracy","Delay effects","Transceivers","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","delay estimation","OFDM modulation","space communication links","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM-based precise ranging technique","space application","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","time domain analysis","frequency domain analysis","coarse estimation","waveform correlation","time delay estimation","phase difference","pseudonoise ranging method","phase ranging method"]}],"abstract":"A novel ranging technique based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is proposed for the ranging systems in space by using the properties of OFDM in time and frequency domains.

For example, humans without computer aided tools would not be able to design VLSI chips larger than 100 transistors. Computers are assisting humans in many aspects of their life. For many years already computers were used for number crunching, office related jobs, etc. More recently computers are used for making intelligent decisions. The methods of computational intelligence are relatively successful, but these methods have to be used with great care. In this presentation advantages and disadvantages of fuzzy and neural networks are presented. It turns out that often popular training algorithms are not capable of tuning neural networks to proper accuracy without losing generalization abilities. Also, abilities of neural networks strongly depend on the used architecture, and surprisingly the most popular architectures usually are least powerful.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937337/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12094779","htmlLink":"/document/5937337/","conferenceDate":"19-21 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Can computers be more intelligent than humans?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Can computers be more intelligent than humans?","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"052keynote2paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053066S","chronDate":"19-21 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5929029","isNumber":"5937329","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5929029","xplore-issue":"5937329","articleId":"5937337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5937350,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Yu","affiliation":["Aubum University, Auburn, USA"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Yu","id":"37533942100"},{"name":"Tiantian Xie","affiliation":["Aubum University, Auburn, USA"],"lastName":"Tiantian Xie","id":"37530446300"},{"name":"Michael Hamilton","affiliation":["Aubum University, Auburn, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Hamilton","id":"37709108700"},{"name":"Bogdan Wilamowski","affiliation":["Aubum University, Auburn, USA"],"firstName":"Bogdan","lastName":"Wilamowski","id":"37277687500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9638-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9639-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2254"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-2246"},{"format":"CD","value":"2158-2246"}],"articleNumber":"5937350","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":589},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Backpropagation","Radial basis function networks","Noise","Training","Image recognition","Neurons","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","image recognition","neural net architecture","object recognition","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network architectures","digit image recognition","backpropagation networks","radial basis function networks","counterpropagation networks","3-layer architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["backpropagation networks","counterpropagation networks","image recognition","radial basis function networks"]}],"abstract":"The paper presents the design of three types of neural networks with different features, including traditional backpropagation networks, radial basis function networks and counterpropagation networks.

Our previous researches show that compared with neural networks, the NN-tree can classify given data in a hierarchical structure which has very small system scale can can be applied to many PORTABLE DEVICE applications. However, for text data, the high dimensionality is a serious problem for induction of NNTrees since the system scale may still become too large and each NN spends too much time for training. To solve the problem, we have proposed discriminant multiple center (DMC) method. In this paper, we combined DMC method with comparative advantage (CA) based algorithm together and proposed discriminant comparative advantage based multiple center (DCAMC) method for inducing NNTrees. DCAMC is a two-stage approach, in which all data are first mapped to a lower dimensional space based on the comparative advantage law, and the LDA is then conducted on the mapped space. Experimental results on three popular databases show that DCAMC can produce NNTrees more efficiently than DMC method.","doi":"10.1109/HSI.2011.5937370","pdfPath":"/iel5/5929029/5937329/05937370.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"228","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Human System Interactions, HSI 2011","publicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Human System Interactions, HSI 2011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HSI.2011.5937370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937329","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inducing portable neural network trees for text data through DCAMC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937370/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Inducing portable neural network trees for text data through DCAMC","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12094809","publicationDate":"May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5937370/","conferenceDate":"19-21 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inducing portable neural network trees for text data through DCAMC","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"22R13hsi2011submission26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072091S","chronDate":"19-21 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5929029","isNumber":"5937329","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5929029","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5937329","articleId":"5937370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5937382,"authors":[{"name":"David Hunter","affiliation":["Brown Mackie College, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Hunter","id":"37707126200"},{"name":"Bogdan Wilamowski","affiliation":["Aubum University, USA"],"firstName":"Bogdan","lastName":"Wilamowski","id":"37277687500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9638-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9639-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2254"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-2246"},{"format":"CD","value":"2158-2246"}],"articleNumber":"5937382","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":332},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937382","abstract":"Neural network research over the past 3 decades has resulted in improved designs and more efficient training methods. In today's high-tech world, many complex non-linear systems described by dozens of differential equations are being replaced with powerful neural networks, making neural networks increasingly more important. However, all of the current designs, including the Multi-Layer Perceptron, the Bridged Multi-Layer Perceptron, and the Fully-Connected Cascade networks have a very large number of weights and connections, making them difficult to implement in hardware. The Parallel Multi-Layer Perceptron architecture introduced in this article yields the first neural network architecture that is practical to implement in hardware. This new architecture significantly reduces the number of connections and weights and eliminates the need for cross-layer connections. Results for this new architecture were tested on parity-N problems for values of N up to 17. Theoretical results show that this architecture yields valid results for all positive integer values of N.","doi":"10.1109/HSI.2011.5937382","startPage":"299","endPage":"304","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Human System Interactions, HSI 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5929029/5937329/05937382.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Human System Interactions, HSI 2011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HSI.2011.5937382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937329","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel Multi-Layer neural network architecture with improved efficiency","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","FCC","Hardware","Artificial neural networks","Equations","Differential equations","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential equations","multilayer perceptrons","neural net architecture","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel multilayer neural network architecture","differential equations","bridged multilayer perceptron","fully-connected cascade networks","parity-n problems","parallel multilayer perceptron architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BMLP","Cascade","Connected","FCC","Fully-Connected","Fully-Connected Cascade","MLP","Multi-Layer","Neural Network","Parity","PMLP"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937382/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Parallel Multi-Layer neural network architecture with improved efficiency","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5937382/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","conferenceDate":"19-21 May 2011","accessionNumber":"12094821","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Multi-Layer neural network architecture with improved efficiency","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"23R15hsi2011submission82.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0708S","chronDate":"19-21 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5929029","isNumber":"5937329","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5929029","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5937329","articleId":"5937382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5937456,"authors":[{"name":"Jaroslaw Pulka","affiliation":["Tyndall National Institute, Cork, Ireland","Department of Applied Physics, Cork Institute of Technology, Cork, Ireland"],"bio":{"p":["Jaroslaw Pulka was born in Zamosc, Poland, on August 1, 1978.

DRSRAM performs a dynamic read operation to overcome the poor stability and bitline leakage problem of 6T SRAM cell in sub-threshold region.

To verify the proposed technique, a 64\u00d7128 bit array of the 6T bit-cell is simulated in 90 nm CMOS technology. The simulation results show a 100% noise margin enhancement at subthreshold region.

The best of the existing systolic structures [7], similarly, involves nearly 43% more ADP and nearly 35% higher EPS than the proposed one for the same filter orders.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937516","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05937516.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","startPage":"121","endPage":"124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high-speed FIR adaptive filter architecture using a modified delayed LMS algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937516","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A high-speed FIR adaptive filter architecture using a modified delayed LMS algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937516/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12522835","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5937516/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high-speed FIR adaptive filter architecture using a modified delayed LMS algorithm","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"a1lg21855.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046273S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5937516","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5937519,"authors":[{"name":"Ariel L.

The decision feedback equalizer (DFE) is one of the preferred receivers for high ISI channels. The high data and symbol rate of current communications systems often require parallel processing receiver implementations [1]. Unfortunately, the complexity of parallel architectures of the DFE grows exponentially with the channel memory [2] and limits their application to low ISI channels. The DFFE avoids the exponential growth of the DFE by using tentative decisions to iteratively cancel the ISI. We show that the DFFE can achieve performance similar to the DFE. These benefits make it an excellent choice for high-speed receivers required to operate over highly dispersive channels.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937519","startPage":"133","endPage":"136","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05937519.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new low complexity iterative equalization architecture for high-speed receivers on highly dispersive channels: Decision feedforward equalizer (DFFE)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"A new low complexity iterative equalization architecture for high-speed receivers on highly dispersive channels: Decision feedforward equalizer (DFFE)","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5937519/","accessionNumber":"12522838","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937519/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new low complexity iterative equalization architecture for high-speed receivers on highly dispersive channels: Decision feedforward equalizer (DFFE)","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"a1lg51936.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047467S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5937519","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":5937535,"authors":[{"name":"Po-Hsing Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Po-Hsing","lastName":"Wu","id":"37710035600"},{"name":"Yan Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Li","id":"37538192100"},{"name":"Weibo Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Weibo","lastName":"Hu","id":"37710522600"},{"name":"J.

To put it into perspective, consuming only 7 pJ/sample, this ADC is able to work at its maximum speed for more than 40 years with the total energy of a single alkaline AA battery.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937551","startPage":"261","endPage":"264","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05937551.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An energy-efficient 1MSps 7\u00b5W 11.9fJ/conversion step 7pJ/sample 10-bit SAR ADC in 90nm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"An energy-efficient 1MSps 7\u00b5W 11.9fJ/conversion step 7pJ/sample 10-bit SAR ADC in 90nm","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5937551/","accessionNumber":"12522870","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937551/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An energy-efficient 1MSps 7\u00b5W 11.9fJ/conversion step 7pJ/sample 10-bit SAR ADC in 90nm","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"a2la31883.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038504S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5937551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5937555,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Sadegh Mehrjoo","affiliation":["Integrated Circuits Design Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Sadegh","lastName":"Mehrjoo","id":"37072464100"},{"name":"Mohammad Yavari","affiliation":["Integrated Circuits Design Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Yavari","id":"37269863600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9474-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9473-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9472-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"5937555","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":761},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance matching","Noise","Impedance","Noise measurement","Transistors","Bandwidth","Thermal noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit noise","low noise amplifiers","low-power electronics","microwave integrated circuits","UHF integrated circuits","ultra wideband technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low power UWB very low noise amplifier","improved noise reduction technique","single-ended ultra wideband low noise amplifier","active positive feedback","input matching extender","transformer","noise figure","RF CMOS technology","bandwidth 2 GHz to 7.6 GHz","size 0.13 mum","power 2.15 mW","voltage 1.1 V"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937555","abstract":"A single-ended ultra wideband (UWB) low noise amplifier (LNA) employing an improved noise reduction (INR) technique is presented.

Effective adaptation requires built in tuning knobs in the RF front end circuits. Due to the sensitive nature of RF circuits traditional tuning knobs affect more than one specification simultaneously. To ensure optimal adaptation it is beneficial to have carefully designed tuning knobs that allows independent control of important specifications. In this paper the design of an inductorless RF LNA is discussed whose specifications can be traded off independently/ orthogonally of each other for reduced power consumption. Two built in tuning knobs are introduced for orthogonal adaptation of Gain and linearity.

The proposed schemes are based on iterative write-and-verify algorithms that exploit the unique programming characteristics of PCM in order to achieve significant improvements in resistance-level packing density, robustness to cell variability, programming latency, energy- per-bit and cell storage capacity. Experimental results from PCM test-arrays are presented to validate the proposed programming schemes. In addition, the reliability issues of multilevel PCM in terms of resistance drift and read noise are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937569","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05937569.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","startPage":"329","endPage":"332","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Programming algorithms for multilevel phase-change memory","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5937569/","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12522887","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937569/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Programming algorithms for multilevel phase-change memory","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"a2ld52040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073641S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5937569","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5937573,"authors":[{"name":"Jordi Albo-Canals","affiliation":["LIFAELS, La Salle-Ramon Llull University, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Jordi","lastName":"Albo-Canals","id":"38278065700"},{"name":"Giovanni E.

A main difference to sampled data systems is the realization of the delay elements which must be implemented as quasi-continuous time delay lines. Thus a large chip area is required for the delay elements which are also a critical point of these systems. Therefore in this paper a method will be presented which allows reducing the implementation costs and power consumption of these elements. This can be achieved by granularity reduction without sacrificing performance. Furthermore implementation aspects for an integrated solution will be covered.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937589","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05937589.pdf","startPage":"410","endPage":"413","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization and implementation of continuous time DSP-systems by using granularity reduction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimization and implementation of continuous time DSP-systems by using granularity reduction","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5937589/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12522905","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937589/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization and implementation of continuous time DSP-systems by using granularity reduction","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"a2lh51576.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053848S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5937589","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5937591,"authors":[{"name":"Carlo Samori","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Carlo","lastName":"Samori","id":"37271398700"},{"name":"Marco Zanuso","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Zanuso","id":"37322389000"},{"name":"Salvatore Levantino","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Salvatore","lastName":"Levantino","id":"37271401200"},{"name":"Andrea L.

The Viterbi and Viterbi (V&V) algorithm is commonly used as a typical method for phase noise recovery. The V&V algorithm performs data dependency elimination by using complex multipliers that raise the value of the M-ary PSK signal to the power of M. However, the V&V algorithm may not be suitable for extremely high-speed carrier recovery because of the complicated complex multipliers. To achieve high speed and low complexity, we propose a new algorithm which performs data dependency elimination without using the complex multipliers.

This method can also be adopted to cyclic padded (CP) or zero padded (ZP) OFDM systems and single carrier ones.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05937602.pdf","startPage":"462","endPage":"465","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937602","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937602","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937602","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Fading","Estimation","Head","Doppler shift","Frequency domain analysis","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","digital video broadcasting","Doppler shift","echo suppression","fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","Chinese DTTB system","long echo","Doppler shift","digital television terrestrial broadcasting","fading channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937602/","displayDocTitle":"A channel estimation scheme for Chinese DTTB system combating long echo and high doppler shift","accessionNumber":"12522918","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5937602/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A channel estimation scheme for Chinese DTTB system combating long echo and high doppler shift","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"a2ll41195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061494S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5937602","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5937603,"authors":[{"name":"Johan L\u00f6fgren","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Johan","lastName":"L\u00f6fgren","id":"37540362600"},{"name":"Ove Edfors","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ove","lastName":"Edfors","id":"37266577600"},{"name":"Peter Nilsson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Nilsson","id":"37269371300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9474-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9473-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9472-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"5937603","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":423},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","OFDM","Table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","iterative methods","Long Term Evolution","random-access storage","table lookup","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LTE channel estimation","matching pursuit","estimator complexity","multiplication factors","core unit","RAM memory","lookup table"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes a novel approach to a Matched Pursuit LTE Channel Estimator.

In the proposed ADC architecture, a voltage-controlled delay unit (VCDU) converts an input analog voltage to a delay time. Then the number of clocks output from a gated ring oscillator (GRO) is counted up during the delay time. Because no switched capacitor or opamp is used, the proposed ADC can be implemented in a small area and at low power. For the same reason, it has process scalability: it can be in keeping with Moore's law. A time error is propagated to the second GRO by a multi-stage noise-shaping (MASH) topology, which provides second-order noise-shaping. In a standard 40-nm CMOS process, a SNDR of 45 dB is achievable at an input bandwidth of 3 MHz and a sampling rate of 100 MHz, where the power is 583.2 \u03bcW.

We evaluate the physical phenomenon that the initial state of a 6T-SRAM cell is highly dependent on the process variations, which enables us to use the standard SRAM circuit, as a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF). Important requirements to serve as a PUF are that the start-up values of an SRAM circuit are uniquely determined, unpredictable and similar each time the circuit is turned on. We present the evaluation results of the internal SRAM memories of low power ICs as PUFs and the statistical analysis of the results. The experimental results prove that the low power 90nm commercial 6T-SRAMs are very useful as a PUF.

These two issues are considered critical constraints in terms of High Definition (HD) video coding, since a large volume of data must be processed. The multilevel data reuse scheme proposed in this paper is able to reduce the off-chip memory bandwidth, with direct impact in throughput and energy consumption. This scheme explores the concept of overlapped Search Windows (SW) in more than one level and poses no harm to video quality. Comparisons with related works show that this solution provides the best tradeoff between the use of on-chip memory and reduction of the off-chip memory bandwidth. The data reuse scheme was applied in a ME architecture and the synthesis results show that this solution presented the lowest use of hardware resources and the highest operation frequency among related works. The proposed architecture is able to process 1080p videos at 25 fps, and the reduction ratio of off-chip memory access achieved by the architecture is greater than 95% when compared to the traditional method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05937632.pdf","startPage":"583","endPage":"586","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937632","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multilevel data reuse scheme for Motion Estimation and its VLSI design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Memory management","System-on-a-chip","Motion estimation","Video coding","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion estimation","video coding","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilevel data reuse scheme","motion estimation","VLSI design","off-chip memory bandwidth","high definition video coding","overlapped search window","video quality"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937632/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"A multilevel data reuse scheme for Motion Estimation and its VLSI design","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5937632/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12522948","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multilevel data reuse scheme for Motion Estimation and its VLSI design","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"a3ld42211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075902S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5937632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5937633,"authors":[{"name":"Vin\u00edcius S.

Oversampled subband structures with DFT filter banks are usually employed in order to avoid aliasing effects and keep enough samples to estimate the statistics of the subband signals. In this paper we present a critically sampled subband structure, composed of cosine-modulated filter banks and reduced-order adaptive subfilters, for convolutive blind source separation. Its performance is compared to those of the fullband algorithm, of an oversampled subband algorithm and of a frequency-domain algorithm. We also evaluate, through computer simulations, the impact of reducing the order of the high-frequency subfilters on the separation results for different reverberation characteristics.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937645","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05937645.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","startPage":"633","endPage":"636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subband blind source separation considering acoustic reverberation characteristics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937645","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Subband blind source separation considering acoustic reverberation characteristics","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937645/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12522961","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5937645/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subband blind source separation considering acoustic reverberation characteristics","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"a3lg22069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051117S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5937645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5937647,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The advancement of FPGA technology enables the implementation of complex MCM instances on FPGA, but the shift-and-add network implementation does not make full use of the fundamental resources of FPGA, like the Look-Up Tables (LUT). Since bit-serial implementation optimized for FPGA is slow, an attempt for bit-parallel LUT-based implementation for single constant multiplication has been made. This paper extends this LUT-based method to multiple constant multiplications. It presents an interesting insight and unexpected outcome that the maximal number of LUTs required can be limited far below the theoretical number by mere enumeration without considering the legitimacy of all possible output combinations. Simulation results show that the required logic slices are comparable to the traditional adder-based MCM optimization methods while the delay is reduced by approximately 33%. The advantages are more prominent with increasing number of constants and the bit width used for their representation.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937651","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05937651.pdf","startPage":"657","endPage":"660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit-parallel Multiple Constant Multiplication using Look-Up Tables on FPGA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937651","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937651/","displayDocTitle":"Bit-parallel Multiple Constant Multiplication using Look-Up Tables on FPGA","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12522967","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5937651/","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit-parallel Multiple Constant Multiplication using Look-Up Tables on FPGA","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"a3lh31831.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111965S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5937651","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5937655,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Cassidy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Cassidy","id":"37317056200"},{"name":"Andreas G.

The glial cell, an astrocyte, influences neural behavior to stimulate a neuron to fire. Without glial intervention, the neuron would not have sufficient excitatory postsynaptic potential to fire. This circuit represents a first-order model of the reciprocal feedback between neurons and astrocytes involving gliotransmitters and neurotransmitters, and of the calcium concentrations induced in the astrocytes.

The detector supports signal detection of multiple MIMO modes which are spatial-multiplexing (SM), spatial-diversity (SD), and space-division-multiple-access (SDMA). Cost-reduction is achieved by algorithm and architecture co-design where low-complexity, near-maximum-likelihood (ML) detection algorithms are proposed for these three MIMO modes respectively while keeping in mind that operations could be reused among different MIMO modes. A multi-stage VLSI architecture is accordingly developed that achieves run-time reconfigurability without extra hardware overhead.

Until recently, the application of LR to the superior K-Best tree-search detection algorithm was not practical due to the significant increase in complexity of K-Best as a result of the distortion of tree symmetry caused by LR. However, in our recently published work we developed an innovative K-Best algorithm to accommodate tree-asymmetry with no additional complexity. In this work, we build on this result and perform a detailed analysis of the effect of various LR algorithms on the performance of LR-aided K-Best. We show that LLL and Seysen provide equivalent performance enhancement, however, LLL displays a lower computational complexity and thus is more suitable for LR-aided K-Best. In this work we also show that the application of LR to K-Best allows a large reduction of the K value while maintaining its near-ML performance. For 64-QAM MIMO detection, this leads to about 70% reduction in the complexity of the K-Best detector.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05937662.pdf","startPage":"701","endPage":"704","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937662","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937662","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of lattice-reduction algorithms for a novel LR-compatible K-Best MIMO detector","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","MIMO","Detectors","Lattices","Signal to noise ratio","Algorithm design and analysis","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","MIMO communication","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","lattice-reduction algorithm","LR-compatible K-best MIMO detector","MIMO detectors","K-best tree-search detection","tree symmetry","tree-asymmetry","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937662/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of lattice-reduction algorithms for a novel LR-compatible K-Best MIMO detector","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5937662/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12522977","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of lattice-reduction algorithms for a novel LR-compatible K-Best MIMO detector","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"a3lk41444.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09019S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5937662","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5937663,"authors":[{"name":"Jeoong Sung Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Santa Clara University, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jeoong Sung","lastName":"Park","id":"37539655900"},{"name":"Tokunbo Ogunfunmi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Santa Clara University, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Tokunbo","lastName":"Ogunfunmi","id":"37295149100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9474-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9473-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9472-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"5937663","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":699},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Training","Mathematical model","MATLAB","Table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","field programmable gate arrays","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","channel estimation","MIMO-OFDM","hardware implementation","hardware resource utilization","communication theory","pipelined architecture","calculation logic","redundancy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","OFDM","Channel Estimation","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new hardware implementation of channel estimation for MIMO-OFDM.

In this paper, a novel imitation of biological visual system intelligence is suggested, at the device level with the introduction of novel photodiode morphology. The proposed bio-inspired nanorod photodiode puts the depletion region length on the path of the incident photon instead of on its width, as the case is with the planar photodiodes. The depletion region has a revolving volume to increase the photodiode responsivity, and thus its photosensitivity. In addition, it can virtually boost the pixel fill factor (FF) above the 100% classical limit due to decoupling of its vertical sensing area from its limited planar circuitry area. Furthermore, the suggested nanorod photodiode photosensitivity is analytically proven to be higher than that of the planar photodiode. We also show semi-empirically that the responsivity of the suggested device varies linearly with its height; this important feature has been confirmed using Sentaurus simulation. The proposed nano-photorod is believed to meet the increasingly stringent High-Resolution-Low-Light (HRLL) detection requirements of the camera-phone and biomedical imaging markets.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bio-inspired nano-photodiode for Low Light, High Resolution and crosstalk-free CMOS image sensing","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937686","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05937686.pdf","startPage":"797","endPage":"800","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937686","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937686/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Bio-inspired nano-photodiode for Low Light, High Resolution and crosstalk-free CMOS image sensing","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5937686/","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12523001","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bio-inspired nano-photodiode for Low Light, High Resolution and crosstalk-free CMOS image sensing","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"a4pq42015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045612S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5937686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5937688,"authors":[{"name":"Anna M.R.

A novel transition method is proposed to ensure smooth transitions between constant current (CC) and constant voltage (CV) modes. Since the proposed approach would require only additional diodes, power consumption and chip area are conserved in comparison with other sophisticated methods proposed in prior works. The charger sources a current of 50 mA in CC mode and has an efficiency of 75% ~ 80% throughout the charging sequence. The supply voltage is kept at 3 volts higher than the battery voltage throughout the charging sequence to maintain charging efficiency.

In order to design the classification system, a three- stage approach is used.

The proposed approach shows higher performance than when using features extracted from the LL sub-band.

This trade- off between CMOS transistor scaling and linearity is becoming more and more important as we transition into nano-scale CMOS LNA architectures. As a result, new techniques for the linearization of LNAs while maintaining an above average impedance matching, noise figure, power consumption, and gain are required. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for the adaptive post-distortion of a low power capacitor cross-coupled common gate low noise amplifier which results in compensation of the LNAs third order inter-modulation (IM3) product.The proposed technique is shown to provide excellent improvement in the third order input intercept point (IIP3) with the third order inter modulation tone running parallel with the fundamental tone over a 3 GHz to 10.6 GHz frequency range in a two tone test.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Logic gates","CMOS integrated circuits","Adaptation model","Mathematical model","Linearity","Nonlinear distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","linearisation techniques","low noise amplifiers","radio receivers","transistors","ultra wideband technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital post-linearization","wideband low noise amplifier","ultrawideband wireless receivers","CMOS transistor","nano-scale CMOS LNA architectures","third order inter-modulation","input intercept point"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937803","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05937803.pdf","startPage":"1275","endPage":"1278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital post-linearization of a Wideband Low Noise Amplifier for ultra-wideband wireless receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937803","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Digital post-linearization of a Wideband Low Noise Amplifier for ultra-wideband wireless receivers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937803/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5937803/","accessionNumber":"12467476","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital post-linearization of a Wideband Low Noise Amplifier for ultra-wideband wireless receivers","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"b1lj42482.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048414S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5937803","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5937804,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos.

The equalizer coefficients are computed using the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT). This equalizer must compensate ISI and ICI caused by a selective channel and timing offset.

Many existing NB-LDPC code construction schemes lead to quasi-cyclic or cyclic codes. In this paper, efficient low- complexity NB-LDPC decoder architectures are developed for these two types of codes based on the newly proposed iterative hard reliability-based majority-logic decoding (IHRB-MLGD). Particularly, novel schemes are designed to keep a small proportion of messages in order to reduce the memory requirement without causing noticeable performance loss. Moreover, a shift-message structure is proposed by using memories concatenated with variable node units to enable efficient partial-parallel decoding for cyclic NB-LDPC codes.

Compared with traditional VN structure, the SWM require about 35% less hardware resources to achieve the same BER performance.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937811","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05937811.pdf","startPage":"1307","endPage":"1310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sliding Window Method for stochastic LDPC decoder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937811","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Sliding Window Method for stochastic LDPC decoder","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937811/","publicationDate":"May 2011","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12467484","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5937811/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sliding Window Method for stochastic LDPC decoder","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"b1ll21319.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037222S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5937811","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5937813,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Gu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Gu","id":"37400402300"},{"name":"Shantanu Chakrabartty","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Shantanu","lastName":"Chakrabartty","id":"37270086100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9474-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9473-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9472-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"5937813","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":260},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937813","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Bit error rate","Equations","CMOS integrated circuits","Iterative decoding","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","CMOS integrated circuits","error statistics","iterative decoding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive analog decoder","low-density parity check","LDPC codes","margin propagation","iterative decoding","bit error rates","energy efficiency","BER","transistor biasing","CMOS process","analog min-sum decoder","SNR","size 0.5 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["error-correction circuits","low-density paritycheck (LDPC) decoder","margin propagation (MP)","analog decoders","current-mode circuits"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937813","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive analog low-density parity-check decoder based on margin propagation","startPage":"1315","endPage":"1318","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05937813.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937813","abstract":"One of the key factors underlying the popularity of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is its iterative decoding algorithm which is amenable to efficient analog and digital implementation. However, different applications of LDPC codes (e.g. wireless sensor networks) impose different sets of constraints which include speed, bit error rates (BER) and energy efficiency. Our previous work reported an algorithmic framework for designing margin propagation (MP) based LDPC decoders where the BER performance can be traded off with its energy efficiency. In this paper we present an analog current-mode implementation of an MP-based (32,8) LDPC decoder. The implementation uses only addition, subtraction and threshold operations and hence is independent of transistor biasing and robust to variations in environmental conditions (e.g. temperature). Measured results from prototypes fabricated in a 0.5 \u03bcm CMOS process verify the functionality of a (32,8) LDPC decoder and demonstrate superior BER performance compared to the state-of-the-art analog min- sum decoder at SNR greater than 3.5 dB.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937813/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5937813/","accessionNumber":"12467486","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive analog low-density parity-check decoder based on margin propagation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive analog low-density parity-check decoder based on margin propagation","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"b1ll41845.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124688S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5937813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5937814,"authors":[{"name":"Bongjin Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bongjin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37534757000"},{"name":"In-Cheol Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"In-Cheol","lastName":"Park","id":"37270580300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9474-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9473-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9472-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"5937814","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":301},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Throughput","WiMAX","Parity check codes","Parallel processing","Switches","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codecs","decoding","parity check codes","scheduling","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QC-LDPC decoding architecture","stride scheduling","area-efficient decoder architecture","quasi-cyclic low-density parity check","WiMAX 802.16e standard","scheduling scheme","stride scheduling","flexible permutation network","synthesized decoder costs"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an area-efficient decoder architecture is proposed for the quasi-cyclic low-density parity check (QC-LDPC) codes specified in the WiMAX 802.16e standard.

In [1], we proposed a novel human visual quality based (HVS) subpixel downsampling method. In this paper, we propose a hardware-friendly subpixel based downsampling scheme based on our previous work which can achieve similar performance as [1] but eliminate all floating point operations with limited bandwidth and much better performance than Direct Pixel based Downsampling (DPD) and Pixel-based downsampling with Anti-aliasing Filter (PDAF).

The proposed beamformer can provide maximum scan angle of up to \u00b160\u00b0 for two antennas with 8 cm spacing. The whole beamformer consumes 38 mA from a 1.8V DC power supply.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937871/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12485116","publicationDate":"May 2011","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5937871/","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An integrated beamformer for IR-UWB receiver in 0.18-\u00b5m CMOS","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An integrated beamformer for IR-UWB receiver in 0.18-\u00b5m CMOS","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"b2lk31770.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039235S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5937871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5937874,"authors":[{"name":"Dipayan Das","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"],"firstName":"Dipayan","lastName":"Das","id":"37531966900"},{"name":"Hereward J.

However, the high power density, i.e., power dissipation per unit volume due to the high integration incurs temperature-related problems such as reliability of 3D-stacked memory. Error correcting codes (ECCs) are commonly used to deal with soft errors and thereby enhance system reliability. In this paper, we present the effects of temperature, refresh period, and ECC policy on the reliability and power consumption of 3D-stacked embedded DRAM (eDRAM). To minimize the energy consumption of the 3D-stacked eDRAM without violating error rate limitation, refresh period and ECC policy must be controlled in a temperature-aware manner. Experimental results show that the proposed adaptive ECC policy with varying temperature achieves a reduction of energy consumption by up to 26% compared with fixed ECC policy under a given error rate constraints.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937902","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937902","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05937902.pdf","startPage":"1672","endPage":"1675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937902/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Thermal-aware energy minimization of 3D-stacked L3 cache with error rate limitation","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","accessionNumber":"12485147","htmlLink":"/document/5937902/","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal-aware energy minimization of 3D-stacked L3 cache with error rate limitation","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"b3lc41975.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077674S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5937902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5937903,"authors":[{"name":"Marcelo Mandelli","affiliation":["FACIN, PUCRS, Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Marcelo","lastName":"Mandelli","id":"37706975500"},{"name":"Luciano Ost","affiliation":["FACIN, PUCRS, Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Luciano","lastName":"Ost","id":"38259883900"},{"name":"Everton Carara","affiliation":["FACIN, PUCRS, Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Everton","lastName":"Carara","id":"37570252300"},{"name":"Guilherme Guindani","affiliation":["FACIN, PUCRS, Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Guilherme","lastName":"Guindani","id":"37313833800"},{"name":"Thiago Gouvea","affiliation":["FACIN, PUCRS, Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Thiago","lastName":"Gouvea","id":"37720714200"},{"name":"Guilherme Medeiros","affiliation":["FACIN, PUCRS, Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Guilherme","lastName":"Medeiros","id":"37707064800"},{"name":"Fernando G.

While the weighted sum strategy is preferable if the problem is known to be convex, or if a smaller number of controlling parameters is advantageous, the goal attainment method provides a better control over accessed parts of the Pareto front, but only at the cost of higher demands on the designer as well as on the used computational power. The robustness is increased by means of a two-stage modified single-objective method. The use of both methods is demonstrated on a practical example of a video amplifier design involving a four-dimensional optimization. Obtained results are evaluated and discussed regarding average correlation and inferiority. Furthermore, an interpolative approach to generating graphical output suitable for multidimensional problems is suggested and used for the four-dimensional objective space of the optimized circuit.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05937916.pdf","startPage":"1728","endPage":"1731","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937916","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An implementation of the circuit multiobjective optimization with the weighted sum strategy and goal attainment method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Correlation","Frequency modulation","Gain","Voltage measurement","IEEE 802.11 Standards","Capacitance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","interpolation","Pareto optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit multiobjective optimization","weighted sum strategy","goal attainment method","Pareto front","two-stage modified single-objective method","video amplifier design","four-dimensional optimization","interpolative approach"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"An implementation of the circuit multiobjective optimization with the weighted sum strategy and goal attainment method","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5937916/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12485160","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An implementation of the circuit multiobjective optimization with the weighted sum strategy and goal attainment method","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"b3lf32109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101645S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5937916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5937917,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Although, range and maximum mismatch analysis of linear arithmetic circuits has been studied before [8], regarding analysis of MSE, the previous works [9,10,12] cannot analyze the error, when it is defined as the difference between the fixed-point circuit and the reference model, e.g., floating-point format. This paper presents an efficient analysis of MSE for linear arithmetic circuits narrowing on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) units. Furthermore, an optimization algorithm is introduced to set the bit-widths in an FFT unit while satisfying a given maximum bound on MSE. Experimental results prove the robustness of our MSE analysis and the efficiency of the optimization algorithm compared to [12] for an 8K FFT unit.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05937917.pdf","startPage":"1732","endPage":"1735","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937917","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Mean-Square-Error (MSE) for fixed-point FFT units","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Optimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Hardware","Signal processing algorithms","Digital video broadcasting","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","fixed point arithmetic","mean square error methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mean-square-error","MSE","fixed-point FFT units","fractional bit-widths","fixed-point variables","linear arithmetic circuits","fixed-point circuit","fast Fourier transform units","8K FFT unit"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937917/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Mean-Square-Error (MSE) for fixed-point FFT units","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5937917/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12485161","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Mean-Square-Error (MSE) for fixed-point FFT units","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"b3lf41544.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067412S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5937917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5937920,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Mamaghanian","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Mamaghanian","id":"37706559500"},{"name":"Nadia Khaled","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Nadia","lastName":"Khaled","id":"38230948900"},{"name":"David Atienza","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Atienza","id":"37275656500"},{"name":"Pierre Vandergheynst","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Vandergheynst","id":"37285157700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9474-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9473-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9472-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"5937920","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":464},"abstract":"Wireless body sensor networks (WBSN) hold the promise to enable next-generation patient-centric tele-cardiology systems. A WBSN-enabled electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor consists of wearable, miniaturized and wireless sensors able to measure and wirelessly report cardiac signals to a WBSN coordinator, which is responsible for reporting them to the tele-health provider. However, state-of-the-art WBSN-enabled ECG monitors still fall short of the required functionality, miniaturization and energy efficiency. Among others, energy efficiency can be significantly improved through embedded ECG compression, which reduces airtime over energy-hungry wireless links. In this paper, we quantify the potential of the emerging compressed sensing (CS) signal acquisition/compression paradigm for low complexity energy-aware ECG compression on the state-of-the-art Shimmer\u2122 WBSN mote.

In modern applications involving wide input bandwidths, uniform sampling, the common practice for generic digitization, leads to prohibitively large sampling and processing rates due to the wide Nyquist bandwidth of the input. In this paper, we present the X-ADC system which narrows down the input bandwidth by analog preprocessing prior to sampling at rates substantially lower than Nyquist. As we show, the X-ADC strategy is generic in the sense that multitude radio and medical imaging applications with structured signals can utilize the same architecture for low rate acquisition. A recently published sub-Nyquist hardware, which was designed according to the proposed X-ADC scheme, provides a concrete reference for the present study. We complement the generic acquisition by reporting on a real-time embedded implementation of a sub-Nyquist reconstruction algorithm. The embedded design enables, for example, fast spectrum sensing which is essential to real-time cognitive radio applications.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937921","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05937921.pdf","startPage":"1748","endPage":"1751","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generic sensing hardware and real-time reconstruction for structured analog signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Generic sensing hardware and real-time reconstruction for structured analog signals","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12485165","publicationDate":"May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5937921/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937921/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generic sensing hardware and real-time reconstruction for structured analog signals","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"b3lg32437.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0694S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5937921","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5937922,"authors":[{"name":"Jian-Feng Gu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Jian-Feng","lastName":"Gu","id":"37290556200"},{"name":"Wei-Ping Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Wei-Ping","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37275886700"},{"name":"M.N.S.

The total power dissipation includes the radiated power as well as the circuit power consumption. In the context of battery operated short range communication, where low power, low cost and small size are key requirements (e.g. standard IEEE 802.15.4), this circuit aware system optimization is crucial given the growing importance of \u201cGreen Communication\u201d. In fact, the power dissipation of certain analog and digital components along the signal path reaches values in the order of or is even higher than the transmit power in such applications. Using an appropriate information-theoretic framework we derive the optimal bit-resolution of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC), the optimal choice of the noise figure for the low noise amplifier (LNA), the optimal operating input back-off (IBO) of the power amplifier (PA), as well as the optimum decoding (DEC) strategy as a function of the path-loss (i.e. the communication distance), that guarantee a certain net data rate R under a certain error probability P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e</sub>\n.

By means of an 8-bit pipeline adder and on the basis of computation simulations (@ 1V, 45nm SOI process), we show that our proposed SAPTL adder is 37% faster, yet 14% lower power dissipation (@ 200MHz input-rate), 18% lower energy dissipation (per operation), and 47% better energy-delay product. These substantially improved attributes are achieved with insignificant overhead - just 3% more transistors.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transistors","Adders","Decision making","Delay","Power dissipation","Pipelines","Driver circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","amplifiers","asynchronous circuits","low-power electronics","transistor-transistor logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous-logic dual-rail sense amplifier based pass transistor logic","low power operation","high speed operation","SAPTL approach","pass transistors","floating nodes","pipeline adder","computation simulations","power dissipation","energy dissipation","energy-delay product","word length 8 bit","frequency 200 MHz"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937968","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05937968.pdf","startPage":"1936","endPage":"1939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved asynchronous-logic dual-rail Sense Amplifier-based Pass Transistor Logic with high speed and low power operation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improved asynchronous-logic dual-rail Sense Amplifier-based Pass Transistor Logic with high speed and low power operation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5937968/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5937968/","accessionNumber":"12485210","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved asynchronous-logic dual-rail Sense Amplifier-based Pass Transistor Logic with high speed and low power operation","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"b4ps32038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045049S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5937968","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5937986,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Da Clinton Goh","affiliation":["Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London, UK"],"firstName":"Zheng Da Clinton","lastName":"Goh","id":"37711185600"},{"name":"Pantelis Georgiou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Centre of Bio-Inspired Technology, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Imperial College London, UK"],"firstName":"Pantelis","lastName":"Georgiou","id":"37302145800"},{"name":"Timothy G.

In manufacturing testing, it becomes important to quickly and accurately locate the delay defect area. Conventional delay testing methods do not take into account the spatial information of process variation induced delay faults, thus cannot accurately limit the delay defects to a well restricted area. Based on the superb locality preserving feature of space-filling curves, we develop a method to locate delay faults in much finer resolution. The method uses a Hilbert curve to guide the test configuration of FPGAs. Depending on the number of observation points inserted to the curve, different levels of locating resolution can be achieved. Compared with normal curves, our method obtained around 60% increase in delay faults locating resolution.","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05938002.pdf","startPage":"2059","endPage":"2062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hilbert curve-based delay fault characterization method for FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5938002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5938002","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5938002","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5938002/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Hilbert curve-based delay fault characterization method for FPGAs","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12436196","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5938002/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hilbert curve-based delay fault characterization method for FPGAs","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"c1lc52413.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04255S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5938002","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5938005,"authors":[{"name":"Mehrdad Majzoobi","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Mehrdad","lastName":"Majzoobi","id":"37658445800"},{"name":"Golsa Ghiaasi","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Golsa","lastName":"Ghiaasi","id":"37706122900"},{"name":"Farinaz Koushanfar","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Farinaz","lastName":"Koushanfar","id":"37284705800"},{"name":"Sani R.

The elevated noise floor due to the repeated samples in dynamic focusing is greatly reduced by hardware efficient band-pass filters in the decimation stage following the beam summation.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals have been shown previously to have significant time-domain sparsity. It is shown herein that electromyogram (EMG) signals exhibit both time and frequency-domain sparsity. Hence, CS techniques are advantageous in either domain in reducing the energy consumption in an adaptive data acquisition front-end that is part of a body area network (BAN). A measurement matrix of random values is central to CS computation. Signal-to quantization-noise ratio (SQNR) results with EMG signals show that 6-bit (including sign) Gaussian random coefficients are sufficient for compression factors up to 18X. It is also shown that 6-bit uniform random coefficients are preferred for some EMG bio-signals.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05938011.pdf","startPage":"2095","endPage":"2098","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5938011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5938011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5938011","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sampling of EMG bio-signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromyography","Frequency domain analysis","Time domain analysis","Electrocardiography","Energy efficiency","Medical services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["body area networks","electromyography","medical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sampling","EMG bio-signals","sub-Nyquist analog preprocessing","sparse signals","emerging compressed sensing signal processing paradigm","electrocardiogram","ECG signals","time-domain sparsity","electromyogram","EMG signals","frequency-domain sparsity","CS techniques","adaptive data acquisition front-end","body area network","BAN","measurement matrix","random values","CS computation","signal-to quantization-noise ratio","SQNR","Gaussian random coefficients","compression factors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5938011/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sampling of EMG bio-signals","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5938011/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12436205","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sampling of EMG bio-signals","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"c1le41945.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077129S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5938011","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5938019,"authors":[{"name":"Mauro Mangia","affiliation":["ARCES, Universit\u00e0 di Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Mauro","lastName":"Mangia","id":"37542676000"},{"name":"Riccardo Rovatti","affiliation":["ARCES, Universit\u00e0 di Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Riccardo","lastName":"Rovatti","id":"37269656400"},{"name":"Gianluca Setti","affiliation":["ENDIF, Universit\u00e0 di Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy"],"firstName":"Gianluca","lastName":"Setti","id":"37269657700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9474-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9473-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9472-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"5938019","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":397},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Noise measurement","Generators","Compressed sensing","Electronic mail","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","compressed sensing","signal reconstruction","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog to information conversion","sparse signals","non white signals","statistical design","sensing waveforms","signal digitalization","compressed sensing theory"]}],"abstract":"Analog to Information conversion is a new paradigm in signal digitalization.

Impulsive noise seldom occurs in DSL but when it occurs, it is very destructive and results in dropping the affected DSL symbols at the receiver as they cannot be recovered. By considering impulsive noise a sparse vector, recently developed sparse reconstruction algorithms can be utilized to combat it. We propose an algorithm that utilizes the null carriers for the impulsive noise estimation and cancellation. Specifically, we use compressive sampling for a coarse estimate of the impulse position, an a priori information based MAP metric for its refinement, followed by MMSE estimation for estimating the impulse amplitudes.

While comparing with finite-precision architecture, the proposed scheme yields a reduction of 15% in hardware and 41% in power consumption for similar image reconstruction, and noticeable improvement in image reconstruction quality.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5938026","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05938026.pdf","startPage":"2157","endPage":"2160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5938026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lossless implementation of Daubechies 8-tap wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5938026","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5938026/","displayDocTitle":"Lossless implementation of Daubechies 8-tap wavelet transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12436220","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5938026/","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lossless implementation of Daubechies 8-tap wavelet transform","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"c1lh42088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050383S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5938026","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5938027,"authors":[{"name":"Mauro Di Marco","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Sienna, Siena, Italy"],"firstName":"Mauro","lastName":"Di Marco","id":"37418990500"},{"name":"Mauro Forti","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Sienna, Siena, Italy"],"firstName":"Mauro","lastName":"Forti","id":"37270735600"},{"name":"Massimo Grazzini","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Sienna, Siena, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Grazzini","id":"37397145100"},{"name":"Luca Pancioni","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Sienna, Siena, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Pancioni","id":"37267334700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9474-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9473-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9472-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"5938027","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5938027","abstract":"The paper considers a class of nonsymmetric co operative standard cellular neural networks (SCNNs), which are defined by a cell-linking template, and are characterized by neuron activations modeled by a typical three-segment pwl function.

In this work, a 3D monolithic process flow relying on molecular wafer bonding is proposed and results in all critical steps are given. Significant breakthroughs have been obtained using a full wafer molecular bonding with thin interlayer dielectric and an original salicidation process stabilized up to 650\u00b0C enabling to reach high performance for the top and bottom transistor.

However, the process variation effects of memristors may affect these applications. In this research, we consider the effect of process variations in the thickness of the oxide layer of memristors that are used in Memristor-based Threshold Logic (MTL) gates. As the effect of variations is less pronounced in high memristance values, a variation tolerant design without any degradation in speed is achieved by having a number of high memristance devices in parallel (redundancy factor). We propose an algorithm for the MTL gates to determine the number of memristors in parallel and the variation-minimal high memristance state. A power optimization algorithm is also proposed to map gates in a design using different libraries that have different performance characteristics. Finally, we present the power, delay performance and also the redundancy factor of memristors for various benchmark circuits.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5938047","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05938047.pdf","startPage":"2241","endPage":"2244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5938047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel memristors: Improving variation tolerance in memristive digital circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5938047/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Parallel memristors: Improving variation tolerance in memristive digital circuits","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12436241","htmlLink":"/document/5938047/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel memristors: Improving variation tolerance in memristive digital circuits","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"c1ln12228.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051088S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5938047","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5938064,"authors":[{"name":"Ji Kong","affiliation":["School of Electronic, Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Kong","id":"37535552100"},{"name":"Peilin Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic, Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Peilin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37402099000"},{"name":"Zhenqi Wei","affiliation":["School of Electronic, Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhenqi","lastName":"Wei","id":"37531821300"},{"name":"Kun Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronic, Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37713696400"},{"name":"Ying Ye","affiliation":["School of Electronic, Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Ye","id":"37715301500"},{"name":"Rendong Ying","affiliation":["School of Electronic, Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Rendong","lastName":"Ying","id":"37265730700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9474-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9473-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9472-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"5938064","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Benchmark testing","Delta modulation","Transistors","OFDM","Bandwidth","Reduced instruction set computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio coding","digital signal processing chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["StreamPoP","stream programming oriented power-efficient audio DSP","digital signal processing","consumer audio","audio computation specific","deep-instruction-pipeline","AAC real-time decoding","size 90 nm","power 5.1 mW"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5938064","abstract":"In stream programming style, the computation and the memory accesses are decoupled as much as possible. Such kind of programming style has brought new profits both on performance and power-efficiency for digital signal processing. In this paper, the architecture of a stream programming oriented power-efficient digital signal processor named as StreamPoP has been presented for consumer audio applications. The instruction and data supply subsystem of StreamPoP has been well designed for flexible stream programming and high power-efficiency. To further reduce the power consumption, an audio computation specific deep-instruction-pipeline (DIP) has been used in the micro-architecture of StreamPoP. To evaluate the performance of StreamPoP for consumer audio applications, a set of audio benchmarks have been used. It has been presented in this paper that the performance of StreamPoP is better than conventional high performance DSPs, while the former architecture is much more power-efficient for audio applications. The simulated power consumption result of StreamPoP under TSMC 90nm process is 5.1mW for AAC real-time decoding.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5938064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5938064","startPage":"2309","endPage":"2312","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05938064.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"StreamPoP: Stream programming oriented power-efficient audio DSP","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"StreamPoP: Stream programming oriented power-efficient audio DSP","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5938064/","accessionNumber":"12436257","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5938064/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"StreamPoP: Stream programming oriented power-efficient audio DSP","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"c2lc31511.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058025S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5938064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5938065,"authors":[{"name":"Hans Kristian Otnes Berge","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Hans Kristian Otnes","lastName":"Berge","id":"37688051400"},{"name":"Snorre Aunet","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Snorre","lastName":"Aunet","id":"38558572600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9474-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9473-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9472-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"5938065","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":173},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5938065","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Transistors","Robustness","Integrated circuit modeling","Power demand","Optimization","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS digital integrated circuits","logic circuits","Pareto optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["size 65 nm","voltage 150 mV","Pareto front","heuristic multiobjective optimization algorithm","power supply voltage","circuit topologies","CMOS logic","ultra-low voltage supplies","minority-3 functions"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5938065","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05938065.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","startPage":"2313","endPage":"2316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5938065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective optimization of minority-3 functions for ultra-low voltage supplies","abstract":"Low supply voltages, small currents and small circuit feature sizes will for CMOS logic typically coincide with deteriorating robustness, i.e. a reduction of a circuits ability to maintain correct functionality across all operating conditions.

The uniqueness is inadequate than expected because some of multi-bit responses are never generated. In this study, we propose a novel arbiter-PUF utilizing a RG-DTM (Response Generation according to Delay Time Measurement) scheme. The uniqueness is evaluated by the standard deviation of the Hamming Distance distribution between generated 256-bit responses.

Error vector magnitude (EVM) and adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) results show a significant improvement compared with conventional PD systems.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5938085","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05938085.pdf","startPage":"2393","endPage":"2396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5938085","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compensation of IQ imbalance and transmitter nonlinearities in broadband MIMO-OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5938085","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5938085/","displayDocTitle":"Compensation of IQ imbalance and transmitter nonlinearities in broadband MIMO-OFDM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12436276","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5938085/","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compensation of IQ imbalance and transmitter nonlinearities in broadband MIMO-OFDM","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"c2lg41790.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054356S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5938085","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5938086,"authors":[{"name":"Amanda de Paula","affiliation":["Escola Polit\u00e9cnica, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Amanda","lastName":"de Paula","id":"37710559300"},{"name":"Cristiano Panazio","affiliation":["Escola Polit\u00e9cnica, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Cristiano","lastName":"Panazio","id":"37284660600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9474-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9473-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9472-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"5938086","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Iron"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision feedback equalisers","error statistics","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BER","DFE","OFDM","convex analysis","SCCP","single carrier with cyclic prefix","decision feedback equalizer","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","bit error rate"]}],"abstract":"This article aims to establish a theoretical performance comparison between the Single Carrier with Cyclic Prefix (SCCP) equalized with a Decision Feedback Equalizer (DFE) and the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems.

The traditional standard cell flow don't really takes care of power minimization at physical level, because there is a limited number of logical functions in a cell library, as well a limited number of sizing versions. To really obtain an optimization at physical level, it is needed to allow the use of any possible logical function, by also using complex cells (Static CMOS complex gates SCCG) that are not available in a cell library. To have a \"freedom\" in the logic design step, it is needed the use of an EDA set of tools to let the automatic design of any transistor network (even with a different number of P and N transistors). This approach can reduce the amount of transistors needed to implement a circuit, reducing the power consumption, mainly the leakage power that is proportional to the number of components (transistors). This paper presents some examples and comparisons between the standard cell approach and the network of transistors approach. The flexibility of the approach can also let the designers to define layout parameters to cope with problems like tolerance to transient effects, yield improvement, printability and DFM.

In this paper, we propose a novel stateful logic pipeline architecture based on memristive switches. CMOS control switches are used to isolate stateful logic units so that multiple operations can be executed in parallel. Since basic operation of the stateful logic, namely material implication, cannot fan out, a new AND basic operation which can duplicate output is proposed. The basic unit of the proposed architecture is designed to execute multiple basic operations concurrently in a step so that each basic unit implements a large fan-in OR or NOR gate. Due to the fine grain ultra-deep constant-throughput pipeline properties, design paradigm shifts are required. We address some of the issues, in particular logic representation using Staged OR-NOR Graphs (SONGs), and data synchronization with data forwarding.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5938111","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05938111.pdf","startPage":"2497","endPage":"2500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5938111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stateful logic pipeline architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5938111","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5938111/","displayDocTitle":"Stateful logic pipeline architecture","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12436302","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5938111/","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stateful logic pipeline architecture","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"c2ln11180.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095095S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5938111","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5938116,"authors":[{"name":"Sandhya Purighalla","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Sandhya","lastName":"Purighalla","id":"37705784900"},{"name":"Brent Maundy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Brent","lastName":"Maundy","id":"37269998100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9474-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9473-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9472-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"5938116","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":470},"abstract":"A new digitally-controlled exponential variable gain amplifier is presented in this paper.

In this paper, we propose a new MCP scheme by adaptive patch matching with the full use of the reconstructed pixels surrounding the current block (referred to as the template inside the patch) aiming at achieving a more accurate prediction than conventional MCP. The proposed scheme not only takes advantage of the temporal correlation but also efficiently exploits the spatial correlation between the current block and its template inside the patch. An adaptive linear combination of the current block and its template in motion estimation is designed to generate an optimal prediction while maintaining the local variation of the current block. Accordingly, a modification of the rate-distortion criterion is introduced to select the combined prediction.

Scalable Video Coding (SVC) is efficient for rate adaptation and unequal protection in wireless networks where heterogeneous mobile clients have different hardware specifications and time-varying channel conditions. Using the scalability characteristics of SVC, we propose a general approach to ensure fairness for multiple scalable video downlink from a multiple-antenna base station. The fairness is achieved by packet priority analysis referring to layer dependency from application layer and a MAXMIN resource allocation at the physical layer. Based on packet priorities, time-frequency resource, power and modulation schemes are adaptively selected for transmission. This scheme significantly improves the overall system performance and guarantee fairness among users, as demonstrated by experimental comparisons with conventional radio resource allocation schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5938148","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05938148.pdf","startPage":"2645","endPage":"2648","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5938148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A MAXMIN resource allocation approach for scalable video delivery over multiuser MIMO-OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5938148","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5938148/","displayDocTitle":"A MAXMIN resource allocation approach for scalable video delivery over multiuser MIMO-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12436337","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5938148/","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A MAXMIN resource allocation approach for scalable video delivery over multiuser MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"c3lg41447.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049571S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5938148","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5938155,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Zhao","affiliation":["VIRTUS IC Design Centre of Excellence, School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38024438700"},{"name":"Shoushun Chen","affiliation":["VIRTUS IC Design Centre of Excellence, School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Shoushun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37535877300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9474-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9473-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9472-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"5938155","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Feature extraction","Hardware","Humans","Convolution","Image sensors","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image sensors","logic gates","pose estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["realtime feature extraction","MAX-like convolutional network","human posture recognition","logic gates","custom-designed motion detection image sensor","hardware-accelerated classifier"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a realtime feature extraction processor based on MAX-like convolutional network.

Numerical results are presented which show that the proposed method is very promising for state estimation of Hopfield neural networks.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5938157","startPage":"2681","endPage":"2684","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5938157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05938157.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An LMI based state estimator for delayed Hopfield neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5938157/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An LMI based state estimator for delayed Hopfield neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5938157/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12436346","publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An LMI based state estimator for delayed Hopfield neural networks","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"c3lj41632.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053059S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5938157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5938158,"authors":[{"name":"Golnar Khodabandehloo","affiliation":["Research Centre of Integrated Microsystems, Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Windsor, Windsor, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Golnar","lastName":"Khodabandehloo","id":"37391740700"},{"name":"Mitra Mirhassani","affiliation":["Research Centre of Integrated Microsystems, Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Windsor, Windsor, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Mitra","lastName":"Mirhassani","id":"37294908800"},{"name":"Majid Ahmadi","affiliation":["Research Centre of Integrated Microsystems, Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Windsor, Windsor, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Majid","lastName":"Ahmadi","id":"37276374600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9474-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9473-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9472-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"5938158","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Equations","Mathematical model","Noise","Accuracy","Indexes","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resistive type truncated CVNS distributed neural networks","DNN","self scaling property","higher noise immunity","continuous valued number system","noise to signal ratio","NSR"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5938158","abstract":"Distributed Neural Networks (DNNs) are generally providing self-scaling property together with higher noise immunity for resistive-type neural networks.

Truncation methods are applied to CVNS digits to make them adaptable to the low resolution environments. However, truncated CVNS operations may decrease the accuracy and immunity to noise compared to the complete CVNS operations. In this work, a truncated CVNS DNN is proposed, and studies over Noise to Signal Ratio (NSR) and accuracy are provided.

This approach makes use of the comparison between current log-likelyhood ratios (LLRs) and updated LLRs of all variable nodes to determine termination criteria of iterations.

In comparison to a 2-level modulator coding efficiency can be increased by 10% over a large input power range with a 3-level modulator. Scaling the quantizer thresholds offers a trade-off between coding efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio. The bandpass modulator architecture allows twofold interleaving. A constraint on the quantizer thresholds and the feedback values reduces the effective operand word width in the feedback loop to the 5 most significant bits. Pipelining of the less significant bits leads to a short critical path. Interleaving and pipelining promise fast operation and thus a high maximum signal frequency.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Signal to noise ratio","Frequency modulation","Adders","Pipeline processing","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","power amplifiers","sigma-delta modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipelined 3-level bandpass delta-sigma modulator","class-S power amplifier","digital bandpass delta-sigma modulator","2-level modulator coding efficiency","signal-to-noise ratio","bandpass modulator architecture"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5938176","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05938176.pdf","startPage":"2757","endPage":"2760","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5938176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A pipelined 3-level bandpass delta-sigma modulator for class-S power amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5938176","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A pipelined 3-level bandpass delta-sigma modulator for class-S power amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5938176/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5938176/","accessionNumber":"12436364","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A pipelined 3-level bandpass delta-sigma modulator for class-S power amplifiers","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"c4pq31644.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040943S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5938176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5938179,"authors":[{"name":"Albert Garcia i Tormo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Albert","lastName":"Garcia i Tormo","id":"37086641773"},{"name":"Alberto Poveda","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Poveda","id":"37274231500"},{"name":"Eduard Alarc\u00f3n","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Eduard","lastName":"Alarc\u00f3n","id":"37274243200"},{"name":"Francesc Guinjoan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Francesc","lastName":"Guinjoan","id":"37274244600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9474-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9473-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9472-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"5938179","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":275},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Switches","Inductors","Switching converters","Mathematical model","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","earthing","electromagnetic interference","network topology","power amplifiers","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grounded-output 5-switch bipolar buck-boost converter topology","switching power amplifier","supply voltage","negative voltages","positive voltages","grounded load","power conversion","EMI-sensitive applications","single-stage switching amplifier","symmetrical bipolar voltage signal"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5938179","abstract":"This work presents a switching converter topology which can boost and step down the supply voltage and can deliver both positive and negative voltages to a grounded load (bipolar converter topology with non-floating output).

Exceptionally high dynamic range (DR) and improved signal-to- noise-ratio (SNR) have been demonstrated for this class of image sensors. Unfortunately, their spatial resolution is limited by the need of an in-pixel memory to record the timing information. The AER protocol is an attractive method for removing this overhead, since pixel trigger events can be sent as address vectors, and in- pixel data memories are no longer required. Regrettably, the need to send address vectors can place an increased burden on the communication channel and will limit the array resolution, frame-rate, and image quality. In this paper, we present a low- complexity AER Block Compression (AERBC) algorithm which exploits the statistically ordered nature of AER pixel arrays. The address vector overhead can be dramatically reduced under this scheme. Only 0.0625 comparisons and 0.125 subtractions are performed for each pixel, and on average 30.82 dB PSNR can be achieved at 1.0 bit-per-pixel code rate. A general strategy is also developed here to optimize AERBC parameters so a balance between performance and hardware resources can be reached.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-complexity image compression algorithm for Address-Event Representation (AER) PWM image sensors","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5938193","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5910713/5937406/05938193.pdf","startPage":"2825","endPage":"2828","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5938193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937406","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5938193","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5938193/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"A low-complexity image compression algorithm for Address-Event Representation (AER) PWM image sensors","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5938193/","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12436379","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-complexity image compression algorithm for Address-Event Representation (AER) PWM image sensors","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"c4pt52335.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063108S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5910713","isNumber":"5937406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5910713","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5937406","articleId":"5938193","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5938207,"authors":[{"name":"Harika Manem","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Harika","lastName":"Manem","id":"37542438300"},{"name":"Garrett S.

The memristor, or memory resistor, is a novel nanoelectronic device that holds great promise for continued scaling for emerging applications. Memristor behavior is very similar to that of the synapses necessary for realizing a neural network. In this research, we have considered circuits that leverage memristance in the realization of an artificial synapse that can be used to implement neuromorphic computing hardware. A novel charge sharing based neural network is described which consists of a hybrid of conventional CMOS technology and novel memristors.

While implementing PHM depends on real-time acquiring the present and future health status of a system accurately. For electronic subsystems, built-in-test (BIT) makes it not difficult to achieve these goals. However, reliable prognostics capability is still a bottle-neck problem for mechanical subsystems due to lack of proper on-line sensors. Recent advancements in sensors and micro-electronics technologies have brought about a novel way out for complex mechanical systems, which is called embedded diagnostics/prognostics (ED/EP). ED/EP can provide real-time present condition and prognostic health state by integrating micro-sensors into mechanical structures during design and manufacture, so ED/EP has a revolutionary progress compared to traditional mechanical fault diagnostic/prognostic ways. But how to study ED/EP for complex mechanical systems has not been focused so far. This paper explores the challenges and needs of efforts to implement ED/EP technologies. In particular, this paper presents a technical framework and roadmap of ED/EP for complex mechanical systems. The framework is proposed based on the methodology of system integration and parallel design, which include six key elements (embedded sensors, embedded sensing design, embedded sensors placement, embedded signals transmission, ED/EP algorithms and embedded self-power). Relationships among these key elements are outlined and they should be considered simultaneously during the design of a complex mechanical system. Technical challenges of each key element are emphasized and existed or potential ways to solve each challenge are summarized in detail. Then the development roadmap of ED/EP in complex mechanical systems is brought forward according to potential advancements in related areas, which can be divided into three different stages: individual technology development, system integration and prototype design, and autonomous mechanical systems. In the end, the presented framework is exemplified with a gearbox.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Prognostics and System Health Managment

It plays an important role in Prognostics and System Health Management (PHM) which is applied to monitor spacecraft's performance, detect faults, identify the root cause of the fault, and predict the remaining useful life (RUL) in order to increase safety and reduce downtime of spacecraft in-orbit. This paper proposes a method to detect anomaly of spacecraft in-orbit based on Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS SVM), which has excellent learning, classification and generalization ability. The process is as follows: (1) Data Collection and Preprocessing. Data such as current, voltage, temperature, vibration and so on are acquired in spacecraft in orbit and preprocessed firstly after they are sent to remote measurement and control centers in the ground, including filtering out the noise and removing non-cutting signals. (2) Feature Extraction. Features which contain any combination of numerical and categorical values are extracted and identified from the sensors' signals using statistical methods. (3) Feature Selection. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to select a subset of features that provides a more informative, robust representation of the information contained in the data since PCA is generally effective for dimensionality reduction and data compression. (4) Anomaly Detection. LS-SVM is used to identify abnormal behaviors of spacecraft in-orbit. Meanwhile, the time when the anomaly was first noticed and the potential causes of the anomaly ranging from subsystem to system level are determined.

This paper puts forward a method of particle swarm optimized neural network used to realize prognostics for spacecraft considering the importance of prognostics in the field of PHM study. Firstly based on the principle and operation traits of the spacecraft, the fault modes and fault characteristics are analyzed to obtain the feature that the prognostics can be achieved through the telemetry parameters of the spacecraft. Secondly the neural network is invoked to approximate and model the key telemetry parameters of the spacecraft due to the neural networks high nonlinearity.

The raw signals provided by the sensors are first processed to extract features, which permit to model the physical component and its degradation. The prognostic process is done in two phases: a learning phase and an evaluation phase. During the first phase, the sensors' data are processed in order to extract appropriate and useful features, which are then used as inputs of dedicated learning algorithms in order to estimate the parameters of a MoG-HMM. The obtained model represents the behavior of the component including its degradation. In addition, the model contains the number of health states and the stay durations in each state. Once the learning phase is done, the generated model is exploited during the second phase, where the extracted features are continuously injected to the learned model to assess the current health state of the physical component and to estimate its remaining useful life and the associated confidence. The proposed method is tested on a benchmark data taken from the \u201cNASA prognostic data repository\u201d related to bearings used under several operating conditions. Moreover, the developed method is compared to two methods: the first using traditional HMMs with exponential time durations and the second using regular Hidden Semi Markov Model (HSMM). Finally, simulation results are given and discussed at the end of the paper.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hidden Markov Models for failure diagnostic and prognostic","publicationTitle":"2011 Prognostics and System Health Managment Confernece","doi":"10.1109/PHM.2011.5939488","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Prognostics and System Health Managment Confernece","pdfPath":"/iel5/5918042/5939466/05939488.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PHM.2011.5939488","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5939466","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5939488","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5939488/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-25 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Hidden Markov Models for failure diagnostic and prognostic","conferenceDate":"24-25 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5939488/","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12094621","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hidden Markov Models for failure diagnostic and prognostic","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"MU3047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066441S","chronDate":"24-25 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5918042","isNumber":"5939466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5918042","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5939466","articleId":"5939488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5939530,"authors":[{"name":"Liu Datong","affiliation":["Automatic Test and Control Institute, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Liu Datong","id":"37087728720"},{"name":"Peng Yu","affiliation":["Automatic Test and Control Institute, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Peng Yu","id":"37087571787"},{"name":"Peng Xiyuan","affiliation":["Automatic Test and Control Institute, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Peng Xiyuan","id":"37087267721"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7950-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7951-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7949-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-563X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5656"}],"articleNumber":"5939530","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1030},"abstract":"Accurate fault prediction or remaining useful life (RUL) estimation can obviously reduce cost of maintenance and decrease the probability of accidents so as to improve the performance of the system test and maintenance. At the same time, it is difficult to apply the model-based methods for fault prediction in most applications for complex systems. Due to continuously improving of automation, increasing of sampling frequency and development of computing technology and memory capacity, it gradually promotes data-driven technology into practical methods. Therefore, data-driven fault prognostics based on the sensor or historical test data has become the primary prediction means of complex systems, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and other computational intelligence methods. In the other hands, most of traditional forecasting methods are always off-line that are not suitable for on-line prediction and real-time processing. Furthermore, for some on-line prediction methods such as Online Support Vector Regression (Online SVR), there is conflicts and trade-offs between prediction efficiency and accuracy. In real prognostics and health management (PHM) systems, such as the operating status monitoring and forecasting of complex systems like airplane and aircraft, it requires that the algorithms are flexible and adaptive in realization of balance between prediction efficiency and accuracy to meet different complicated requirements. To solve the problem above, an on-line adaptive data-driven fault prognosis and prediction strategy is presented in this paper. Considering the complex characteristics of trends and neighborhood of time series data, the multi-scale reconstruction strategy is applied to effectively reduce the size of on-line data and preserve rich history knowledge of samples. Therefore, the prediction efficiency could be improved and faster forecasting can be achieved with adaptive multi-scale sub-models. To evaluate the proposed prediction strategy, we have executed experiments with Tennessee Eastman (TE) process data. Experimental results with TE process fault data prove its effectiveness. The experiments and tests confirm the algorithms can be effectively applied to the on-line status monitoring and prediction with excellent performance in both efficiency and precision. New on-line fault status prediction strategy shows better prospect in real-time and on-line application for complex system. It can be applied in industrial fields for system maintenance and prognostics and health management.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Time frequency
