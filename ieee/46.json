The adaptive image segmentation system incorporates a feedback loop consisting of a machine learning subsystem, an image segmentation algorithm, and an evaluation component which determines segmentation quality. The machine learning component is based on genetic adaptation and uses (separately) a pure genetic algorithm (GA) and a hybrid of GA and hill climbing (HC). When the learning subsystem is based on pure genetics, the corresponding evaluation component is based on a vector of evaluation criteria. For the hybrid case, the system employs a scalar evaluation measure which is a weighted combination of the different criteria. Experimental results for pure genetic and hybrid search methods are presented using a representative database of outdoor TV imagery. The multiobjective optimization demonstrates the ability of the adaptive image segmentation system to provide high quality segmentation results in a minimal number of generations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/7.464350","startPage":"1268","endPage":"1291","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.464350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9726","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/9726/00464350.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive image segmentation using genetic and hybrid search methods","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/464350/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive image segmentation using genetic and hybrid search methods","volume":"31","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5089691","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive image segmentation using genetic and hybrid search methods","sourcePdf":"00464350.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046723S","chronDate":"Oct.  1995","isNumber":"9726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"46","articleId":"464350","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":464351,"authors":[{"name":"K.H.

The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) technique is used as the classification algorithm, making classification decisions based on a spatio-temporal sequence of observed object features. A five class problem is considered. Classification accuracies of 100% and 99.7%, are obtained for sequences of images generated over two separate regions of viewing positions. HMMs trained on image sequences of the objects moving in opposite directions showed a 98.1% successful classification rate by class and direction of movement. The HMM technique proved robust to image corruption with additive correlated noise and had a higher accuracy than a single-look nearest neighbor method. A real image sequence of one of the objects used was successfully recognized with the HMMs trained on synthetic data. This study shows the temporal changes that observed feature vectors undergo due to object motion hold information that can yield superior classification accuracy when compared with single-frame techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/7.464351","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/9726/00464351.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.464351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9726","startPage":"1292","endPage":"1300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatio-temporal pattern recognition using hidden Markov models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=464351","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spatio-temporal pattern recognition using hidden Markov models","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/464351/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5089692","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatio-temporal pattern recognition using hidden Markov models","sourcePdf":"00464351.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039923S","chronDate":"Oct.  1995","isNumber":"9726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"16","articleId":"464351","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":464371,"authors":[{"name":"G.B.

Toward this end, a 4-transmit channel and 4-receive channel hardware device and concomitant image reconstruction algorithm have been realized. The hardware is designed to measure electric fields (i.e., amplitude and phase) at various locations in a phantom tank with and without the presence of various heterogeneities using standard heterodyning principles. Particular attention has been paid to designing a receiver with better than 115 dB of linear dynamic range which is necessary for imaging biological tissue which often has very high conductivity, especially for tissues with high water content. A calibration procedure has been developed to compensate for signal loss due to 3-dimensional radiation in the measured data, since the reconstruction process is only 2-dimensional at the present time. Results are shown which demonstrate the stability and accuracy of the measurement system, the extent to which the forward computational model agrees with the measured field distribution when the electrical properties are known, and image reconstructions of electrically unknown targets of varying diameter. In the latter case, images of both the reactive and resistive component of the electrical property distribution have been recoverable. Quantitative information on object location, size, and electrical properties results when the target is approximately one-half wavelength in size. Images of smaller objects lack the same level of quantitative information, but remain qualitatively correct.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/9727/00464376.pdf","startPage":"1017","endPage":"1026","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/10.464376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.464376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9727","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=464376","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An active microwave imaging system for reconstruction of 2-D electrical property distributions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave imaging","Image reconstruction","Electric variables measurement","Microwave devices","Hardware","Biological tissues","Hyperthermia","Monitoring","Phase measurement","Imaging phantoms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave imaging","bioelectric phenomena","medical image processing","image reconstruction","hyperthermia"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active microwave imaging system","2D electrical property distributions reconstruction","hyperthermia treatment monitoring","hyperthermia treatment assessment","concomitant image reconstruction algorithm","electric fields measurement","heterogeneities","standard heterodyning principles","linear dynamic range","biological tissue imaging","forward computational model","resistive component","electrically unknown targets","varying diameter targets","medical imaging"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artifacts","Calibration","Equipment Design","Evaluation Studies as Topic","Humans","Hyperthermia, Induced","Hyperthermia, Induced","Microwaves","Models, Structural"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/464376/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1995","displayDocTitle":"An active microwave imaging system for reconstruction of 2-D electrical property distributions","volume":"42","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5076297","pubMedId":"8582719","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An active microwave imaging system for reconstruction of 2-D electrical property distributions","sourcePdf":"00464376.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034503S","chronDate":"Oct.  1995","isNumber":"9727","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"78","articleId":"464376","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":464391,"authors":[{"name":"H.M.

An SPN is considered to display good avalanche characteristics if a one bit change in the plaintext input is expected to result in close to half the ciphertext output bits changing. Good avalanche characteristics are important to ensure that a cipher is not susceptible to statistical attacks and the strength of an SPN's avalanche characteristics may be considered as a measure of the randomness of the ciphertext. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that the avalanche behavior of encryption networks can be improved by using larger S-boxes. As well, it is shown that increasing the diffusion properties of the S-boxes or replacing the permutations by diffusive linear transformations is effective in improving the network avalanche characteristics.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/464391/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5096241","volume":"44","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Avalanche characteristics of substitution-permutation encryption networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Avalanche characteristics of substitution-permutation encryption networks","sourcePdf":"00464391.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057933S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"35","articleId":"464391","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":464396,"authors":[{"name":"Choong Gun Oh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Texas, Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Choong Gun Oh","id":"37087703474"},{"name":"Hee Yong Youn","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Texas, Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Hee Yong Youn","id":"37087177839"},{"name":"V.K.

The npn transistors utilize nitride-oxide composite spacers formed using sacrificial TEOS spacers, a process which is simpler than the previously reported composite spacer processes. Use of the composite spacer structure virtually eliminates problems relating to the extrinsic-intrinsic base link-up and reduces plasma induced damage associated with the conventional spacer process. Microwave and RF capabilities of the process up to several GHz are demonstrated by fabricating and characterizing RF amplifiers, low noise amplifiers, and RF switches.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/9729/00464412.pdf","startPage":"1831","endPage":"1840","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/16.464412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.464412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9729","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=464412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low cost and low power silicon npn bipolar process with NMOS transistors (ADRF) for RF and microwave applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","Silicon","MOSFETs","Radio frequency","Switches","Microwave transistors","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Bipolar transistors","Resistors","Plugs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bipolar MMIC","MMIC amplifiers","silicon","elemental semiconductors","integrated circuit technology","UHF amplifiers","UHF integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["npn bipolar process","NMOS transistors","microwave applications","RF applications","double-polysilicon self-aligned transistors","polysilicon gates","lateral pnp transistors","p/sup +/ polysilicon-to-n/sup +/ plug capacitors","nitride-oxide composite spacers","sacrificial TEOS spacers","extrinsic-intrinsic base link-up","plasma induced damage","low noise amplifiers","RF amplifiers","RF switches","UHF circuits","25 GHz","5.5 V","0.7 micron","Si"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/464412/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"A low cost and low power silicon npn bipolar process with NMOS transistors (ADRF) for RF and microwave applications","volume":"42","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5068590","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low cost and low power silicon npn bipolar process with NMOS transistors (ADRF) for RF and microwave applications","sourcePdf":"00464412.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068258S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"21","articleId":"464412","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":464418,"authors":[{"name":"N.

At each stage of the search, a threshold is calculated and a binary-type question is posed to each member of the sample. The threshold is determined from answers given to the previous questions, and no exact data is ever collected, i.e., no member is asked to explicitly provide his observation. Arrow, Pesotchinsky, and Sobel (APS) calculated the optimal threshold sequence for two different objectives: (i) minimize the average number of questions required for a solution, and (ii) maximize the probability of solving the problem in, at most, r questions. APS have assumed that the number of respondents in the affirmative at each stage of the search is exactly known. There exist applications where the number of affirmative answers is only known to be one member of the set (0, 1, more than 1). For these applications, we calculate exactly the optimal thresholds, in the sense of maximizing the probability of getting precisely one affirmative answer to the next binary question. An application of the threshold-calculation procedure is demonstrated in resolution of packet collisions over multiuser communication channel.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/464441/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5068731","volume":"25","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Partitioning a sample using binary-type questions with ternary feedback","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partitioning a sample using binary-type questions with ternary feedback","sourcePdf":"00464441.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035782S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"5","articleId":"464441","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":464512,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Woo Choi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong-Woo Choi","id":"37336481400"},{"name":"Seung-Ki Sul","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seung-Ki Sul","id":"37267508300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0093-9994"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9367"}],"articleNumber":"464512","dbTime":"40 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":157,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":2255},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industry Applications Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ias/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=464512","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation","Nonlinear distortion","Clamps","Pulse width modulation inverters","Low voltage","Frequency","AC machines","Machine vector control","Hardware","Industry Applications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM invertors","compensation","switching circuits","electric distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation strategy","voltage/current distortion reduction","PWM VSI systems","low output voltages","voltage-fed PWM inverter","reference voltage","dead time effect","voltage drop","switching devices","nonlinear voltage distortion","current waveform distortion","current clamping","low-frequency"]}],"doi":"10.1109/28.464512","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/9732/00464512.pdf","startPage":"1001","endPage":"1008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.464512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new compensation strategy reducing voltage/current distortion in PWM VSI systems operating with low output voltages","abstract":"In a voltage-fed PWM inverter, the relation between the reference voltage and the output voltage is nonlinear due to the dead time effect and the voltage drop of the switching devices. The nonlinear voltage distortion invokes serious problems such as current waveform distortion and deterioration of the performance. Especially, the clamping of current around the zero crossing point is the most serious problem in the low-frequency region. In this paper, the analysis of the zero current clamping phenomenon is discussed. From this analysis, a novel distorted voltage compensation method which eliminates zero current clamping is presented.

Air-gap torque can be calculated while the motor is running. No special down time for measurement is required. Data of the air-gap torque for a motor should be periodically kept for comparison purposes. Since more data than just a line current are taken, this method offers other potential possibilities that cannot be handled by examining only a line current. The theoretical foundation for this proposed method is presented. Experiments conducted on a 5-hp motor show the validity and potential of this approach. Further studies are planned to extend the proposed method in detail and to monitor defects developed in other types of rotating machines.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/9732/00464514.pdf","startPage":"1016","endPage":"1021","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/28.464514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.464514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9732","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=464514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monitoring of defects in induction motors through air-gap torque observation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Induction motors","Air gaps","Torque","Rotors","Bars","Stators","Coils","Time measurement","Condition monitoring","Rotating machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motors","monitoring","machine theory","torque measurement","air gaps","stators","coils","rotors","computerised monitoring","fault diagnosis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["defects monitoring","air-gap torque observation","cracked rotor bars","shorted stator coils","induction motors","line current","5 hp"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/464514/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"Monitoring of defects in induction motors through air-gap torque observation","volume":"31","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5076389","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monitoring of defects in induction motors through air-gap torque observation","sourcePdf":"00464514.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044448S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1995","isNumber":"9732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"164","articleId":"464514","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":464516,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This paper presents a new approach of taking account of these flux waveforms in the calculation of core losses. Relations between the fluxes of different parts of the magnetic circuits are given in the form of matrix equations, where the fluxes are expressed in terms of normalized flux pulses. Rewriting the eddy-current loss term in the Steinmetz equation in terms of the square of dB/dt and combining it with the matrix equations, eddy-current losses for the complicated flux waveforms of the stator and rotor yokes are calculated. The effect of PWM is taken into account by considering the PWM voltage waveform as dB/dt. From the matrices, it is easy to count how many times full and minor hysteresis loops occur at each pole and yoke segment. The effect of the minor loop is taken into account based on experimental results. The proposed approach gives a systematic procedure for core loss calculation. The derived equations are simple and useful in the design of SRM.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/28.464517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9732","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.464517","endPage":"1046","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/9732/00464517.pdf","startPage":"1039","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach to calculating core losses in the SRM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/464517/","displayDocTitle":"A new approach to calculating core losses in the SRM","volume":"31","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"5076392","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach to calculating core losses in the SRM","sourcePdf":"00464517.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025726S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1995","isNumber":"9732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"82","articleId":"464517","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":464518,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The rotor of the permanent magnet motor is assumed to have sinusoidally distributed magnetic poles along the axial surface, while the rotor of the induction type motor is assumed to have uniform magnetic property. The inner wall of the stator is also assumed to have a current sheet, which can produce an arbitrary current distribution. The same number of magnetic poles gives the rotating torque to the rotor, while plus/minus two poles of the motoring control produces a pure radial force to the rotor. By controlling the magnitude and phase of the plus/minus two-pole current distribution relative to the motoring magnetic pole, the radial force can be controlled in the radial coordinate. This general solution is experimentally confirmed by using a simple experimental setup.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and comparison of PM synchronous motor and induction motor type magnetic bearings","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/28.464518","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/9732/00464518.pdf","startPage":"1047","endPage":"1053","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.464518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9732","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=464518","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/464518/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and comparison of PM synchronous motor and induction motor type magnetic bearings","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5076393","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and comparison of PM synchronous motor and induction motor type magnetic bearings","sourcePdf":"00464518.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031093S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1995","isNumber":"9732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"57","articleId":"464518","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":464519,"authors":[{"name":"D.

These models characterize a texture in terms of spatial interaction within each color plane and interaction between different color planes. The models are used by a segmentation algorithm based on agglomerative hierarchical clustering. At the heart of agglomerative clustering is a stepwise optimal merging process that at each iteration maximizes a global performance functional based on the conditional pseudolikelihood of the image. A test for stopping the clustering is applied based on rapid changes in the pseudolikelihood. We provide experimental results that illustrate the advantages of using color texture models and that demonstrate the performance of the segmentation algorithm on color images of natural scenes. Most of the processing during segmentation is local making the algorithm amenable to high performance parallel implementation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/9734/00464559.pdf","startPage":"939","endPage":"954","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.464559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.464559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9734","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=464559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Markov random field models for unsupervised segmentation of textured color images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Markov random fields","Image segmentation","Color","Clustering algorithms","Merging","Image analysis","Distributed computing","Heart","Testing","Layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","image colour analysis","image texture","Markov processes","computer vision","merging","natural scenes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov random field models","unsupervised segmentation","textured color images","color textures","spatial interaction","agglomerative hierarchical clustering","stepwise optimal merging process","global performance functional","conditional pseudolikelihood","color texture models","natural scenes","high performance parallel implementation","computer vision"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/464559/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"Markov random field models for unsupervised segmentation of textured color images","volume":"17","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5076479","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Markov random field models for unsupervised segmentation of textured color images","sourcePdf":"00464559.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041383S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9734","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"300","articleId":"464559","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":464560,"authors":[{"name":"R.

For this purpose, a joint disturbance observer for robot manipulators is presented to estimate the reaction force due to component misinsertion. The derivation is presented in the time domain for a multi-degree-of-freedom manipulator without making the SISO linear system assumption. Based on the internal model control (IMC) concept, this observer is simple in structure. It is in the form of an integral controller and only requires measurements of joint position and velocity signals to be implemented. The observed perturbation signal includes the effects of model uncertainties as well as reaction force against the environment. Careful trajectory planning and detailed friction modeling are performed to enhance accuracy of the deduced reaction force. Experiments conducted on a SCARA robot for the insertion of PCB components demonstrated the performance of the proposed disturbance observer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Manipulators","Force control","Robotic assembly","Electronic components","Monitoring","Linear systems","Velocity control","Position measurement","Velocity measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["printed circuit manufacture","industrial manipulators","manipulators","observers","force control","controllers","position measurement","velocity measurement","uncertain systems","friction","position control","velocity control","force measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robot manipulators","electronic components assembly","disturbance observer","insertion force monitoring","insertion force control","reaction force estimation","multi-degree-of-freedom manipulator","internal model control","integral controller","joint position measurement","velocity signals measurement","observed perturbation signal","model uncertainties","reaction force","SCARA robot","PCB components"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=464611","doi":"10.1109/41.464611","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/9736/00464611.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.464611","startPage":"487","endPage":"493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9736","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A disturbance observer for robot manipulators with application to electronic components assembly","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A disturbance observer for robot manipulators with application to electronic components assembly","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/464611/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","volume":"42","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5075313","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A disturbance observer for robot manipulators with application to electronic components assembly","sourcePdf":"00464611.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074696S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"50","articleId":"464611","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":464612,"authors":[{"name":"T.

However, it has disadvantages in that it is greatly affected by the parameter and load variation in the servo system with the LDM because it is not equipped with auxiliary mechanisms. The influence of the parameter variation and load change of the servo system are regarded as an equivalent disturbance signal and the compensation action is applied by utilizing the estimated value of the equivalent disturbance.

A backpropagation neural network operating in the specialized learning mode, using the sign gradient descent algorithm, is employed. The input vector to the neural network controller consists of the time history of the motor angular shaft velocity within a prespecified time window. The on-line training of the neural network is performed in the region of interest of the output domain. The neural network output resembles that of a pulse width modulated controller. The effect of the number of neurons in the input and hidden layers on the transient system response is explored.

Our methodology differs from many previous studies that have concentrated on end-point definitions of flows in terms of state derived from observing the explicit opening and closing of TCP connections. Instead, our model defines flows based on traffic satisfying various temporal and spatial locality conditions, as observed at internal points of the network. This approach to flow characterization helps address some central problems in networking based on the Internet model. Among them are route caching, resource reservation at multiple service levels, usage based accounting, and the integration of IP traffic over an ATM fabric. We first define the parameter space and then concentrate on metrics characterizing both individual flows as well as the aggregate flow profile. We consider various granularities of the definition of a flow, such as by destination network, host-pair, or host and port quadruple. We include some measurements based on case studies we undertook, which yield significant insights into some aspects of Internet traffic, including demonstrating (i) the brevity of a significant fraction of IP flows at a variety of traffic aggregation granularities, (ii) that the number of host-pair IP flows is not significantly larger than the number of destination network flows, and (iii) that schemes for caching traffic information could significantly benefit from using application information.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"

In general, improvements in image contrast for multiscale image processing algorithms were superior to those obtained using existing competitive algorithms. These initial results are encouraging and suggest that wavelet based image processing algorithms could play an important role in improving the imaging performance of digital mammography. In part 2, features blended into the mammograms were \"idealized\" representations of the types of objects that are of primary interest to mammographers. The resultant mammographic images were appropriate for the purpose of demonstrating improved image contrast made possible by wavelet based image processing algorithms. These images were also useful for comparing multiscale wavelet based algorithms with existing image processing algorithms. The test results obtained in this study, however, cannot be directly extrapolated to clinical mammography. In addition, it is also important to study possible image artifacts introduced by new wavelet filters, which may increase the false positive rate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/51/9742/00464770.pdf","startPage":"536","endPage":"550","publicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","doi":"10.1109/51.464770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/51.464770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9742","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=464770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelets for contrast enhancement of digital mammography","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mammography","Breast cancer","Image processing","Diseases","Filtering","Neoplasms","Noise level","Cancer detection","Image resolution","Diagnostic radiography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diagnostic radiography","wavelet transforms","medical image processing","image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["contrast enhancement","digital mammography","multiresolution representations","adaptive mechanism","local emphasis","image contrast","multiscale image processing algorithms","wavelet based image processing algorithms","mammographic images","multiscale wavelet based algorithms","image artifacts","wavelet filters","false positive rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/464770/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"Wavelets for contrast enhancement of digital mammography","volume":"14","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5075581","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelets for contrast enhancement of digital mammography","sourcePdf":"464770.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026486S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1995","isNumber":"9742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"51","citationCount":"151","articleId":"464770","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":464775,"authors":[{"name":"Pongskorn Saipetch","affiliation":["Department of Radiological Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles, USA"],"lastName":"Pongskorn Saipetch","id":"37353869000"},{"name":"B.K.T.

We have developed a compression algorithm based on discrete wavelet transforms (DWTs) and arithmetic coding (AC) that satisfies those requirements. This new method is superior to the previously developed full frame discrete cosine transform (FFDCT) method, as well as the industrial standard developed by the joint photographic expert group (JPEG). Since DWT is localized in both spatial and scale domains, the error due to quantization of coefficients does not propagate throughout the reconstructed picture as in FFDCT. Because it is a global transformation, it does not suffer the limitation of block transform methods such as JPEG. The severity of the error as measured by the normalized mean square error (NMSE) and maximum difference technique increases very slowly with compression ratio compared to the FFDCT. Normalized nearest neighbor difference (NNND), which is a measure of blockiness, stays approximately constant, while JPEG NNND increases rapidly with compression ratio. Furthermore, DWT has an efficient finite response filter FlR implementation that can be put in parallel hardware. DWT also offers total flexibility in the image format; the size of the image does not have to be a power of two as in the case of FFDCT.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/51.464775","publicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/51/9742/00464775.pdf","startPage":"587","endPage":"593","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/51.464775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying wavelet transforms with arithmetic coding to radiological image compression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=464775","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/464775/","displayDocTitle":"Applying wavelet transforms with arithmetic coding to radiological image compression","volume":"14","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5075586","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying wavelet transforms with arithmetic coding to radiological image compression","sourcePdf":"00464775.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068667S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1995","isNumber":"9742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"51","citationCount":"17","articleId":"464775","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":464825,"authors":[{"name":"A.P.

If not adequately suppressed, clutter can severely affect the ability of color Doppler systems to accurately estimate the Doppler mean frequency and power of blood, resulting in a potentially misleading depiction of flow. In this study, the performances of two classes of clutter suppression techniques-step-initialized infinite impulse response (IIR) and regression filters-were evaluated and compared by means of extensive simulations. The performance indicators used were the accuracy and precision of the mean frequency and the power estimates after clutter filtering. In summary, the ability of both filter classes to suppress clutter was found to vary considerably depending on factors such as the clutter-to-flow-signal ratio and the ensemble length. In particular, the performance of step-initialized IIR filters was shown to be noticeably inferior to that predicted by their steady-state response. Regression filters were found to offer significantly better performance than step-initialized IIR filters under heavy clutter conditions and, given their steeper roll-off, appear to be more effective clutter suppressors for power Doppler imaging. However, it should be noted that, as demonstrated by the simulations, the performance of IIR filters is severely degraded by their transient response which, in turn, is determined by the initialization scheme used. Therefore, more elaborate schemes-with superior transient characteristics than step-initialization-could significantly improve the effectiveness of IIR filtering under heavy clutter conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.464825","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/9744/00464825.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.464825","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9744","startPage":"927","endPage":"937","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance of regression and step-initialized IIR clutter filters for color Doppler systems in diagnostic medical ultrasound","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=464825","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the performance of regression and step-initialized IIR clutter filters for color Doppler systems in diagnostic medical ultrasound","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/464825/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5069743","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance of regression and step-initialized IIR clutter filters for color Doppler systems in diagnostic medical ultrasound","sourcePdf":"464825.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03765S","chronDate":"Sept.  1995","isNumber":"9744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"86","articleId":"464825","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":464858,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The analysis, however, is essential not only for optimizing the SRM magnetic structure but also for proper control of the associated power electronic circuit. In this paper, a direct modeling method for analysis of a SRM system including the power electronic converter, control and the nonlinear magnetic field of the SRM is established. The finite element method is used to model the nonlinear magnetic field, and is coupled to the circuit model of the SRM overall system. Assumptions of current density in FEA and various types of flux-current characteristics in circuit analysis are eliminated. With simultaneous computation over the entire system, the computer model provides abundant information regarding the SRM system.

The neural network is utilized to identify the optimal operating voltage of the PV power system. The controller generates the control signal in real-time, and the control signal is fed back to the voltage control loop of the inverter to shift the terminal voltage of the PV power system to its identified optimum, which yields maximum power generation. The controller is of the PI type. The proportional and the integral gains are set to their optimal values to achieve fast response and also to prevent overshoot and also undershoot. Continuous measurement is required for the open circuit voltage on the monitoring cell, and also for the terminal voltage of the PV power system. Because of the accurate identification of the optimal operating voltage of the PV power system, more than 99% power is drawn from the actual maximum power.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/464880/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5077153","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of neural network based real time maximum power tracking controller for PV system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of neural network based real time maximum power tracking controller for PV system","sourcePdf":"00464880.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041718S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9745","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"111","articleId":"464880","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":464882,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Feng Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chun-Feng Lu","id":"37087267106"},{"name":"Chun-Chang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chun-Chang Liu","id":"37087182013"},{"name":"Chi-Jui Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan Institute of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chi-Jui Wu","id":"37087168711"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8969"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0059"}],"articleNumber":"464882","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":2068},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/power/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=464882","abstract":"Since a battery energy storage system (BES) can provide fast active power compensation, it also can be used to improve the performance of load-frequency control. In this paper a new incremental model of a BES is presented and merged into the load-frequency control of a power system. A comprehensive digital computer model of a two-area interconnected power system including governor deadband and generation rate constraint is employed for a realistic response. Computer simulations show that the BES is very effective in damping the oscillations caused by load disturbances. The BES model is suitable for charging mode and discharging mode operations. Optimization of controller gains is obtained by the second method of Lyapunov.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/60.464882","startPage":"555","endPage":"561","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel3/60/9745/00464882.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.464882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9745","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of battery energy storage system on load frequency control considering governor deadband and generation rate constraint","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Energy storage","Frequency control","Power system modeling","Power system interconnection","Power system control","Power system simulation","Control systems","Power systems","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system control","load regulation","frequency control","battery storage plants","energy storage","secondary cells","power system analysis computing","control system analysis computing","digital simulation","Lyapunov methods","power control","power system interconnection","power system stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery energy storage system","load frequency control","governor deadband","generation rate constraint","active power compensation","performance","incremental model","digital computer model","power system control analysis","two-area interconnected power system","computer simulations","oscillations","load disturbances","charging mode","discharging mode","Lyapunov methods","controller gains optimisation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/464882/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Effect of battery energy storage system on load frequency control considering governor deadband and generation rate constraint","volume":"10","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5077155","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of battery energy storage system on load frequency control considering governor deadband and generation rate constraint","sourcePdf":"00464882.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055359S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9745","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"40","articleId":"464882","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":464927,"authors":[{"name":"W.E.L.

Medical problems also deal with flexible, deformable objects, as for example the nonrigid motion of the beating heart. Despite the apparent differences in underlying bases, developments over the past few decades in computer vision, especially through ARPA's Image Understanding Program, are beginning to revolutionize the use of medical imagery: in surgery, in diagnosis, and in therapy evaluation. This applicability of IU techniques to medical problems holds for many of the central problems in traditional IU: extracting key features from the imagery, registering data sets, predicting images of object models from arbitrary viewpoints, and fitting parameterized surface models to data. By tailoring IU techniques designed for traditional vision to the special circumstances of medical imagery, systems are emerging that support effective use of medical image data. To demonstrate the range of roles that IU methods play in medical image utilization, the author describes an end-to-end system for image guided surgery. This system directly builds on a wide range of IU methods to provide surgeons with visualization and guidance during surgical procedures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/64.464927","startPage":"18","endPage":"28","publicationTitle":"IEEE Expert","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/64.464927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9747","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Expert","pdfPath":"/iel3/64/9747/00464927.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Medical applications of image understanding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/464927/","displayDocTitle":"Medical applications of image understanding","volume":"10","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5096867","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Medical applications of image understanding","sourcePdf":"00464927.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024103S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"64","citationCount":"8","articleId":"464927","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":464928,"authors":[{"name":"L.B.

In addition, with this excitation scheme, no dc source distortions are induced on the source plane and nearby. Consequently, the terminal plane can be moved very close to the discontinuity, even at one-cell beyond the input/output reference planes.

The time-dependent formulation employs a time-integration method based on the Newmark-Beta method. A stability analysis is presented demonstrating that this leads to an unconditionally stable solution of the time-dependent vector wave equation. The advantage of this formulation is that the time step is no longer governed by the spatial discretization of the mesh, but rather by the spectral content of the time-dependent signal. A numerical example of a three-dimensional cavity resonator is presented studying the effects of the Newmark-beta parameters on the solution error. Optimal choices of parameters are derived based on this example.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/75.465046","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/75/9751/00465046.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/75.465046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9751","startPage":"332","endPage":"334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An unconditionally stable finite element time-domain solution of the vector wave equation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=465046","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An unconditionally stable finite element time-domain solution of the vector wave equation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/465046/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5071264","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An unconditionally stable finite element time-domain solution of the vector wave equation","sourcePdf":"00465046.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028088S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"75","citationCount":"163","articleId":"465046","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":465047,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In this paper, we propose an adaptive postprocessor for the removal of blocking effects. The adaptation is achieved by changing filter coefficients according to the local characteristics of images and the blocking effects. Here, a space-variant lowpass filter is used to smooth the pixels at block boundaries where the blocking effects are highly visible. In addition, the pixels that are closed to an edge are adaptively regional or directional lowpass filtered if the blocking effects are obvious. As for the pixels at edges, they are left untouched by the postprocessor. Therefore, blocking effects can be removed without blurring the edge sharpness. Performance improvements compared with other techniques are obtained according to simulation results.

Highly bandwidth efficient, fixed but with arbitrarily programmable rate, perceptually weighted discrete cosine transform (DCT) based video codecs are proposed for quarter common intermediate format (QCIF) videophone sequences. Perceptually weighted cost/gain controlled motion compensation and quad-class DCT-based compression is applied with and without run-length coding. Specifically, we propose video codecs having transmission rates in the range of 5-11.36 kbps and preselected the 11.36 kbps codec 1, the 8.52 kbps codec 2 and the 8 kbps codec 2a, for which we designed the intelligent reconfigurable systems 1-5. After sensitivity-matched binary Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) forward error correction (FEC) coding the data rate associated with codec 1 and codec 2a became 20.32 kbps, while that of codec 2 was 15.24 kbps. Throughout these systems a partial forced update (PFU) technique was invoked in order to keep transmitter and receiver aligned amongst hostile channel conditions. When using codec 1 in system 1 and coherent pilot symbol assisted 16-level quadrature amplitude modulation (16-PSAQAM), an overall signalling rate of 9 kBd was yielded. Over lower quality channels the 4QAM mode of operation had to be invoked, which required twice as many time slots to accommodate the resulting 18 kBd stream, The system's robustness was increased using automatic repeat requests (ARQ), inevitably reducing the number of users supported, which was between 6 and 19 for the various systems. In a bandwidth of 200 kHz, similarly to the Pan-European GSM mobile radio system's speech channel, using system 1 for example, 16 and 8 videophone users can be supported in the 16QAM and 4QAM modes, respectively.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/76.465084","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/9752/00465084.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.465084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9752","startPage":"305","endPage":"318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive low-rate wireless videophone schemes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=465084","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive low-rate wireless videophone schemes","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/465084/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5084226","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive low-rate wireless videophone schemes","sourcePdf":"00465084.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075242S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"49","articleId":"465084","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":465085,"authors":[{"name":"C.A.

The conventional way of performing motion compensation as defined in the H.261 and MPEG standards, is to divide the \"new\" frame into a number of nonoverlapping rectangular blocks and then find the best match for each of these blocks by displacing a search window of the same size in the \"previous\" frame (or also the next frame for bidirectional prediction in MPEG). A block prediction based on this method is only accurate if the motion between the two frames is of a translational nature. There is no flexibility to change the size, rotation, or shape of objects if the motion that has taken place between the two frames contains such distortion. We evaluate the use of second-order geometric transformations (GTs) as a means of motion compensation. These transformations are capable of modeling the kind of changes mentioned above and therefore when used properly they have the potential of providing a much more accurate prediction during motion compensation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/76.465085","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/9752/00465085.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.465085","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9752","startPage":"319","endPage":"331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion compensation using second-order geometric transformations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=465085","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Motion compensation using second-order geometric transformations","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/465085/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5084227","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion compensation using second-order geometric transformations","sourcePdf":"00465085.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052522S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"19","articleId":"465085","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":465086,"authors":[{"name":"Shifan Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and nstitute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shifan Chang","id":"38151616600"},{"name":"Juin-Haur Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and nstitute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Juin-Haur Hwang","id":"38151543500"},{"name":"Chein-Wei Jen","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and nstitute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chein-Wei Jen","id":"37267413900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"465086","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":96},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=465086","abstract":"Block matching is a widely used motion estimation algorithm in current video systems. Among typical searching strategies, the full search scheme provides better precision and regular data flow as well as higher parallelism, a characteristic that is advantageous for VLSI implementation. However, the huge computation load incurred by full search results in high cost, especially in high pixel rate applications. Since the block matching algorithm is used in a wide range of pixel rates, an architecture that is cascadable and offers variable computing power is promising. An approach based on dependence graph (DG) is proposed to analyze the operation sequence and data flow of full search block matching. The approach employs a transformation on DGs, called slice and tile, to produce different forms of DGs. Through this technique, most existing architectures can be represented in graphs for analysis, and new architectures can be found. A new architecture is presented that features cascadable modules of processing elements (PEs) with simple interconnection. Therefore, flexibility in computing power is available. The other advantages include variable sizes of the search area and 100% PE utilization. These characteristics offer great flexibility and efficiency for different applications. This architecture is implemented with thirty-two PEs in one chip that consists of 102 K transistors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/76.465086","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","startPage":"332","endPage":"343","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/9752/00465086.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.465086","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable array architecture design for full search block matching","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Hardware","Algorithm design and analysis","Very large scale integration","Motion estimation","Parallel processing","Costs","Flow graphs","Tiles","Integrated circuit interconnections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video signal processing","image matching","motion estimation","parallel architectures","VLSI","digital signal processing chips","data flow graphs","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full search block matching","scalable array architecture design","motion estimation algorithm","video systems","VLSI","pixel rates","variable computing power","dependence graph","operation sequence","data flow","processing elements","variable search area size","transistors","chip"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"Scalable array architecture design for full search block matching","volume":"5","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5084228","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/465086/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable array architecture design for full search block matching","sourcePdf":"00465086.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05221S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"18","articleId":"465086","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":465087,"authors":[{"name":"Kwon Moon Nam","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Seoul, South Korea","Department of Electronic Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kwon Moon Nam","id":"38151309500"},{"name":"Joon-Seek Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea","Department of Electronic Engineering, Hoseo University, Chungnam, South Korea"],"lastName":"Joon-Seek Kim","id":"37678135700"},{"name":"Rae-Hong Park","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Rae-Hong Park","id":"37267489900"},{"name":"Young Serk Shim","affiliation":["Institute for Advanced Engineering, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Young Serk Shim","id":"38149674400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"465087","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":111,"citationCountPatent":38,"totalDownloads":671},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Computational complexity","Hardware","HDTV","PSNR","Moon","Computer errors","Computer simulation","Testing","Video compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding","image sequences","data compression","motion estimation","computational complexity","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast hierarchical motion vector estimation","mean pyramid","fast algorithm","measurement window","tree pruning","computational complexity reduction","mean squared error","three step search methods","computer simulation results","test sequences","interframe coding","compressing video data","moving picture transmission","video coding"]}],"abstract":"In transmitting moving pictures, interframe coding is shown to be effective for compressing video data.

The basis for the approach is a decomposition of a rotation into a sequence of one-dimensional translations. As the accuracy of these operations is critical, we introduce a general theoretical framework that addresses their design and performance. We also investigate the issue of optimality and present an improved least-square formulation of the problem. This approach leads to a separable three-pass implementation of a rotation using one-dimensional convolutions only. We provide explicit filter formulas for several continuous signal models including spline and bandlimited representations. Finally, we present rotation experiments and compare the currently standard techniques with the various versions of our algorithm. Our results indicate that the present algorithm in its higher-order versions outperforms all standard high-accuracy methods of which we are aware, both in terms of speed and quality.

In addition, regularizing smoothness penalties (or priors) introduce parameter coupling, rendering intractable the M-steps of most EM-type algorithms. This paper presents space-alternating generalized EM (SAGE) algorithms for image reconstruction, which update the parameters sequentially using a sequence of small \"hidden\" data spaces, rather than simultaneously using one large complete-data space. The sequential update decouples the M-step, so the maximization can typically be performed analytically. We introduce new hidden-data spaces that are less informative than the conventional complete-data space for Poisson data and that yield significant improvements in convergence rate. This acceleration is due to statistical considerations, not numerical overrelaxation methods, so monotonic increases in the objective function are guaranteed. We provide a general global convergence proof for SAGE methods with nonnegativity constraints.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Penalized maximum-likelihood image reconstruction using space-alternating generalized EM algorithms","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.465106","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/9753/00465106.pdf","startPage":"1417","endPage":"1429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.465106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9753","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=465106","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/465106/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Penalized maximum-likelihood image reconstruction using space-alternating generalized EM algorithms","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5091847","pubMedId":"18291973","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Penalized maximum-likelihood image reconstruction using space-alternating generalized EM algorithms","sourcePdf":"00465106.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04647S","chronDate":"Oct.  1995","isNumber":"9753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"206","articleId":"465106","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":465107,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The algorithms enjoy desirable local and global convergence properties and combine gracefully with Bayesian smoothing priors. Preliminary numerical testing of the algorithms on simulated data suggest that the convex algorithm and the ad hoc gradient algorithm are computationally superior to the EM algorithm. This superiority stems from the larger number of exponentiations required by the EM algorithm. The convex and gradient algorithms are well adapted to parallel computing.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.465107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9753","startPage":"1430","endPage":"1438","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/9753/00465107.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Globally convergent algorithms for maximum a posteriori transmission tomography","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/465107/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1995","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Globally convergent algorithms for maximum a posteriori transmission tomography","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5091848","pubMedId":"18291974","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Globally convergent algorithms for maximum a posteriori transmission tomography","sourcePdf":"00465107.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037778S","chronDate":"Oct.  1995","isNumber":"9753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"233","articleId":"465107","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":465108,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

We demonstrate that an under-relaxed cyclic coordinate-ascent algorithm converges faster than the convex algorithm of Lange (see ibid., vol.4, no.10, p.1430-1438, 1995), which in turn converges faster than the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for transmission tomography. To further reduce computation, one could replace the log-likelihood objective with a quadratic approximation. However, we show with simulations and analysis that the quadratic objective function leads to biased estimates for low-count measurements. Therefore we introduce hybrid Poisson/polynomial objective functions that use the exact Poisson log-likelihood for detector measurements with low counts, but use computationally efficient quadratic or cubic approximations for the high-count detector measurements. We demonstrate that the hybrid objective functions reduce computation time without increasing estimation bias.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Image reconstruction","Attenuation measurement","Positron emission tomography","Image converters","Thorax","Detectors","Biomedical imaging","Lungs","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical image processing","image reconstruction","positron emission tomography","stochastic processes","convergence of numerical methods","maximum likelihood estimation","approximation theory","polynomials","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tomographic image reconstruction","transmission scans","hybrid Poisson/polynomial objective functions","rapidly converging algorithms","attenuation maps","Poisson transmission measurements","penalized-likelihood objective functions","under-relaxed cyclic coordinate-ascent algorithm","convex algorithm","expectation-maximization algorithm","transmission tomography","log-likelihood objective","quadratic approximation","quadratic objective function","positron emission tomography","low-count measurements","exact Poisson log-likelihood","detector measurements","cubic approximations","quadratic approximations","computation time reduction","estimation bias"]}],"doi":"10.1109/83.465108","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/9753/00465108.pdf","startPage":"1439","endPage":"1450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9753","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.465108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Poisson/polynomial objective functions for tomographic image reconstruction from transmission scans","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=465108","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Poisson/polynomial objective functions for tomographic image reconstruction from transmission scans","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/465108/","volume":"4","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5091849","pubMedId":"18291975","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Poisson/polynomial objective functions for tomographic image reconstruction from transmission scans","sourcePdf":"00465108.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048354S","chronDate":"Oct.  1995","isNumber":"9753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"82","articleId":"465108","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":465140,"authors":[{"name":"M.D. Baker","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"M.D.","lastName":"Baker","id":"37357657400"},{"name":"C.D.

In this paper, a neural network trained to model the correlation between DC bias and etch rate was used to predict the time required to remove a specified thickness of silicon dioxide (SiO/sub 2/) in a CHF/sub 3//O/sub 2/ plasma. A real-time data acquisition system that transmits process conditions from a Plasma Therm 700 series RIE system was used to monitor DC bias during etching. A back-propagation neural network was trained to predict the amount of time required to etch the remaining amount of film while in the midst of etching. Inputs to the network included elapsed time during the etch run, the desired etch depth, gas flow rates, chamber pressure, and RF power. This network exhibited a 26 s RMS error on training data, and predicted the process endpoint on a set of test etch recipes with an average error of less than two minutes for a process time of about 25 min.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/95.465140","pdfPath":"/iel4/95/9755/00465140.pdf","startPage":"478","endPage":"483","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part A","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part A","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/95.465140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9755","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"In-situ prediction of reactive ion etch endpoint using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/465140/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"In-situ prediction of reactive ion etch endpoint using neural networks","volume":"18","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5074906","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In-situ prediction of reactive ion etch endpoint using neural networks","sourcePdf":"00465140.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05172S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9755","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"95","citationCount":"17","articleId":"465140","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":465145,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The irregular surfaces of heat sinks present a formidable challenge for designers in determining the boundary conditions along the fluid-solid interface. A simple yet accurate method for calculating the thermal performance of rectangular heat sinks using a flat plate boundary layer model is presented. Several heat sink geometries are examined over a range of Rayleigh number between 10/sup 3/ and 10/sup 10/. The heat-transfer performance of the heat sinks, as given by the Nusselt number, is determined for each test based on the isothermal body temperature and the square root of the wetted surface area. Results obtained using a conjugate model, META, are compared against an analytically-based correlation and experimental data. In addition to the rectangular heat sinks, isothermal cuboids of various sizes are modeled using META, where the cuboid is approximated as a thin uniformly-heated base plate with an attached extended surface. The cuboid results are compared with experimental data and an analytically based correlation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9755","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part A","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part A","pdfPath":"/iel4/95/9755/00465153.pdf","doi":"10.1109/95.465153","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/95.465153","startPage":"559","endPage":"566","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal modeling of isothermal cuboids and rectangular heat sinks cooled by natural convection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/465153/","displayDocTitle":"Thermal modeling of isothermal cuboids and rectangular heat sinks cooled by natural convection","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"5074918","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal modeling of isothermal cuboids and rectangular heat sinks cooled by natural convection","sourcePdf":"00465153.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056747S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9755","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"95","citationCount":"38","articleId":"465153","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":465159,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The classical model of electrochemical migration has been well known for several decades. This process is a transport of metal ions between two metallization stripes under bias through a continuous aqueous electrolyte. Due to the electrodeposition at the cathode, dendrites and dendrite-like deposits are formed. Ultimately, such a deposit can lead to a short circuit in the device and can clause catastrophic failure. A few anomalous and newly discovered phenomena have initiated us to perform some revisions and to add supplementary models to the conventional one.

Modeling the response of the delaminated plastic package is an essential step to fundamentally understand failure mechanisms and mechanics involved in the cooling, moisture absorption, and solder reflow process. A nonlinear finite element model was developed for predicting the deformation, stress, and fracture behavior of delaminated plastic packages induced by mechanical and hygro-thermal loads. The model consists of a sequentially coupled hygro-thermo-mechanical analysis considering moisture absorption, evaporation and interface contact and fracture analysis. A Lagrange Multiplier method was utilized to model the delamination interface condition. A general contact model was adopted which can handle complex contact conditions, such as arbitrary slippage and discontinuous curvature. A thermal contact was utilized to model the contact along delamination surfaces. Mixed mode fracture modes were elaborated. The model was verified by comparing existing analytical results with the predictions in the case of pulsed heating of the IC chip. Packaging responses and failure mechanisms due to encapsulation cooling, moisture absorption and evaporation, wave soldering, and interfacial moisture pressure loading are investigated, with consideration of temperature-dependent material properties change around the glass transition temperature for both die attach and molding compound. Packaging deformation and stress, crack tip driving force, doming of the delamination, and delamination growth stability as a function of time are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/95.465163","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part A","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part A","pdfPath":"/iel4/95/9755/00465163.pdf","startPage":"634","endPage":"645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/95.465163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9755","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Behavior of delaminated plastic IC packages subjected to encapsulation cooling, moisture absorption, and wave soldering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=465163","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/465163/","displayDocTitle":"Behavior of delaminated plastic IC packages subjected to encapsulation cooling, moisture absorption, and wave soldering","volume":"18","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5074928","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Behavior of delaminated plastic IC packages subjected to encapsulation cooling, moisture absorption, and wave soldering","sourcePdf":"00465163.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051766S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9755","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"95","citationCount":"81","articleId":"465163","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":465354,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

The prediction algorithm is based on the use of radix-2 microrotations with multiple shifts in the first iterations and the use of a redundant radix-2 and radix-4 representation for the coefficients in the rest of the microrotations. The use of multiple shifts facilitates the prediction of the coefficients in the case of microrotations where i/spl les/n/4, being n the precision of the algorithm, and the use of radix-4 microrotations helps to reduce the total number of iterations. The prediction is carried out using the redundant representation of the z coordinate, without any need for conversions to a non-redundant representation. Finally, we present a VLSI architecture based on this algorithm. As the production of the coefficients is very fast, and they are known before starting each microrotation, the resulting architecture can be highly pipelined and consequently appropriate for applications where high speeds are required.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ARITH.1995.465362","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","pdfPath":"/iel2/3236/9762/00465362.pdf","startPage":"172","endPage":"179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.1995.465362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9762","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Redundant Cordic rotator based on parallel prediction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Redundant Cordic rotator based on parallel prediction","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5032819","publicationDate":"1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/465362/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Jul 1995","conferenceDate":"19-21 July 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Redundant Cordic rotator based on parallel prediction","confLoc":"Bath, UK","sourcePdf":"00465362.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049533S","chronDate":"19-21 Jul 1995","isNumber":"9762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3236","citationCount":"6","articleId":"465362","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":465364,"authors":[{"name":"R.K.

In this paper we develop an efficient interpolative approach to such coprocessors. Performed on suitable subintervals of the range of interest, our interpolation which uses third degree polynomial is adequate for many elementary functions of interest with double precision mantissas. Our method requires only one major multiplication, two minor multiplications and a few additions. The minor multiplications are for the second and third degree terms, and their significant bits are much fewer than those of the first degree term. This leads to a very fast and efficient VLSI architecture for such coprocessors. It appears that polynomial based interpolation can yield considerable benefits over previously used approaches, when execution time and silicon area are considered. Further, it is possible to combine the computation of multiple functions on a single chip, with most of the resources on the chip shared for several functions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ARITH.1995.465370","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","pdfPath":"/iel2/3236/9762/00465370.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.1995.465370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9762","startPage":"107","endPage":"114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-speed double precision computation of nonlinear functions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=465370","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-speed double precision computation of nonlinear functions","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Jul 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/465370/","conferenceDate":"19-21 July 1995","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5032811","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-speed double precision computation of nonlinear functions","confLoc":"Bath, UK","sourcePdf":"00465370.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03317S","chronDate":"19-21 Jul 1995","isNumber":"9762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3236","citationCount":"15","articleId":"465370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":465374,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

Important applications are reciprocals, logarithms, exponentials and others.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Read only memory","Digital signal processing","Books","Out of order"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["function evaluation","table lookup","adders","digital arithmetic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["function evaluation","table look-up","addition","ROM tables","adders","worst case error","error bound","reciprocals","logarithms","exponentials"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=465382","doi":"10.1109/ARITH.1995.465382","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","pdfPath":"/iel2/3236/9762/00465382.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.1995.465382","startPage":"10","endPage":"16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9762","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Function evaluation by table look-up and addition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Function evaluation by table look-up and addition","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/465382/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Jul 1995","conferenceDate":"19-21 July 1995","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5032799","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Function evaluation by table look-up and addition","confLoc":"Bath, UK","sourcePdf":"00465382.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030543S","chronDate":"19-21 Jul 1995","isNumber":"9762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3236","citationCount":"48","articleId":"465382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":465383,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this paper, a new initial approximation method for division, an accelerated higher order converging division algorithm, and a new square root algorithm are proposed. They are all suitable for implementation on an arithmetic unit where one multiply-accumulate operation, can be executed in one cycle. In the case of division, the combination of our initial approximation method and our converging algorithm, enables a single iteration of the converging algorithm to produce double-precision quotients. Our new square root algorithm can form, double-precision square roots faster using smaller look-up tables than the Newton-Raphson method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","pdfPath":"/iel2/3236/9762/00465383.pdf","startPage":"2","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","doi":"10.1109/ARITH.1995.465383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.1995.465383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9762","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=465383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient initial approximation and fast converging methods for division and square root","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation algorithms","Approximation methods","Linear approximation","Newton method","Convergence","Costs","Arithmetic","Iterative algorithms","Acceleration","Information science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["initial approximation","fast converging methods","division","square root","accelerated higher order converging division algorithm","square root algorithm","multiply-accumulate operation","double-precision quotients","look-up tables","Newton-Raphson method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/465383/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Jul 1995","displayDocTitle":"Efficient initial approximation and fast converging methods for division and square root","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5032798","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-21 July 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient initial approximation and fast converging methods for division and square root","confLoc":"Bath, UK","sourcePdf":"00465383.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076766S","chronDate":"19-21 Jul 1995","isNumber":"9762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3236","citationCount":"19","articleId":"465383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":465441,"authors":[{"name":"A.G.

Transrectal ultrasound imaging has been an acclaimed choice for systematic analysis of the internal architecture of the prostate gland and also for guiding the selection of biopsy tissue cores from suspicious lesions. The current accuracy of visual interpretation for identifying the presence of cancer from prostate ultrasound images is low. The present study addresses the statistical distribution of digital gray scale values to compare cancerous and noncancerous biopsy sites within a gland. Analyses of selected features from these data, for a limited number of cases, indicate significant differences between cancerous and non-cancerous biopsies with a retrospective biopsy classification accuracy of approximately 80%. This approach therefore shows promise for objective interpretation with improved accuracy.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/465441/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 Jun 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5022908","conferenceDate":"9-10 June 1995","displayDocTitle":"Prostate ultrasound image analysis: localization of cancer lesions to assist biopsy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prostate ultrasound image analysis: localization of cancer lesions to assist biopsy","confLoc":"Lubbock, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00465441.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037198S","chronDate":"9-10 Jun 1995","isNumber":"9763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3237","citationCount":"11","articleId":"465441","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":465474,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Many varied edge detection techniques have been proposed. Different edge detectors present distinct and different responses to the same image, showing different detail. Our proposal is that different edge detection techniques be utilised in parallel, allowing for the attainment of several edge maps containing different features. The merging of the different maps is performed by a neural network arbitrator. To overcome the increased computing time, implementation is being performed on a multi-transputer array, using the inherent parallelism of the techniques involved.

The design process and the various criteria involved in the building of an efficient O(N) 32-bit bit stream-systolic multiplier chip from the algorithmic level to the final implementation stage are described. An entirely different approach is used to implement integer division using the Chinese remaindering theorem. This algorithm generates the first N significant bits of the reciprocal of a number in O(log N) bit steps. This algorithm is asymptotically faster than the implementations currently available for integer division. The scheme is attractive as it forms a basis for the implementation of some more arithmetic functions, like the generation of a power series and multiplication of N N-bit operands in O(log N) time steps. The evaluation and implementation of the modulus function are considered.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SECON.1993.465659","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Southeastcon '93","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Southeastcon '93","pdfPath":"/iel2/3239/9765/00465659.pdf","startPage":"4 p.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.1993.465659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and FPGA implementation of efficient integer arithmetic algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=465659","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Apr 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/465659/","displayDocTitle":"Design and FPGA implementation of efficient integer arithmetic algorithms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"5003970","conferenceDate":"4-7 April 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and FPGA implementation of efficient integer arithmetic algorithms","confLoc":"Charlotte, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"00465659.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052677S","chronDate":"4-7 Apr 1993","isNumber":"9765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3239","citationCount":"2","articleId":"465659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":465673,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The speech data were collected from nine different speakers saying the same word, \"hello\". The speech data were then preprocessed for signal conditioning. Fourteen feature parameters were obtained: 12 of them are the coefficients of the 12/sup th/ order linear predictor (LPC); and the other two were selected as the peak and bandwidth of the spectral envelope. These 14 feature parameters then served as the inputs to the neural network for speaker classification. A standard two-layer feedforward neural network was trained to identify different feature sets associated with the corresponding speakers. The network size was selected to be 14-8-4 (14 input, 8 hidden, and 4 output units). Nine utterances from each speaker were used as training data, and the other one served as testing data. The results showed that the trained network can correctly identify the speakers to an accuracy of 90%. The success rate could be increased by increasing the number of utterances per speaker.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SECON.1993.465673","startPage":"3 p.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Southeastcon '93","pdfPath":"/iel2/3239/9765/00465673.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Southeastcon '93","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.1993.465673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parametric feature-based voice recognition system using artificial neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Artificial neural networks","Loudspeakers","Linear predictive coding","Neural networks","Difference equations","Random sequences","Neural engineering","Bandwidth","Feedforward neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","multilayer perceptrons","linear predictive coding","speech coding","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature-based voice recognition system","artificial neural network","speaker identification experiment","speech data","signal conditioning","feature parameters","LPC","peak","bandwidth","spectral envelope","speaker classification","two-layer feedforward neural network","network size","training data","testing data","trained network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/465673/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Apr 1993","displayDocTitle":"Parametric feature-based voice recognition system using artificial neural network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-7 April 1993","accessionNumber":"5003956","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parametric feature-based voice recognition system using artificial neural network","confLoc":"Charlotte, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"00465673.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031494S","chronDate":"4-7 Apr 1993","isNumber":"9765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3239","citationCount":"1","articleId":"465673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":465674,"authors":[{"name":"C.

A recent VLSI implementation connects many neurons by broadcasting each neuron's address and activation level in turn for all other neurons to process. Such a scheme requires N steps to completely connect N neurons. The proposed architecture uses stochastic activation levels. Since these outputs are simpler, there is room on the global bus for several neurons to fire in parallel. Each neuron processes all outputs in a set of neurons at once, reducing the number of addressing steps on the bus as well as the actual size of the neuron addressing field. This neuron grouping is especially applicable to backpropagation networks.

Since the amplitude and phase noises are stochastic processes, the problem is defined in a stochastic processes context, and a reasonable set of assumptions is imposed to produce a general, straightforward, and easily understood solution. The solution clearly indicates how the natural spectrum of the scatterer, the amplitude and phase noise spectra, and range correlation combine to produce the IF spectrum. A specific example is provided for the case of a pulsed Doppler radar. The results presented indicate that range correlation can have a significant impact on the IF spectrum and thus should be considered in radar analysis and design activities.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SECON.1993.465731","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Southeastcon '93","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Southeastcon '93","pdfPath":"/iel2/3239/9765/00465731.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.1993.465731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9765","startPage":"5 p.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Range correlation effects on phase and amplitude noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=465731","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Range correlation effects on phase and amplitude noise","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Apr 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/465731/","conferenceDate":"4-7 April 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"5003898","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Range correlation effects on phase and amplitude noise","confLoc":"Charlotte, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"00465731.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026442S","chronDate":"4-7 Apr 1993","isNumber":"9765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3239","citationCount":"38","articleId":"465731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":465735,"authors":[{"name":"L.T.

The seismic signal is sampled at a rate 10 times higher than the desired rate to avoid aliasing. The noise in the digitized seismic signal is filtered by a high-order finite impulse response (FIR) digital filter implemented in the microcomputer system. During filtering, excess samples are decimated to yield the required sampling rate. To avoid saturation, variable gain amplifiers (VGAs) were deployed in the design. A 16-b high-resolution analog-to-digital (A/D) converter helps to achieve a large dynamic range (120 dB) of the system and reduce the number of VGA gain ranges. Both computer simulation and experimental results confirm the validity of the design.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a high-order FIR digital filtering and variable gain ranging seismic data acquisition system","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Southeastcon '93","doi":"10.1109/SECON.1993.465773","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Southeastcon '93","pdfPath":"/iel2/3239/9765/00465773.pdf","startPage":"6 p.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.1993.465773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9765","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=465773","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/465773/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Apr 1993","displayDocTitle":"Design of a high-order FIR digital filtering and variable gain ranging seismic data acquisition system","conferenceDate":"4-7 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"5003854","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a high-order FIR digital filtering and variable gain ranging seismic data acquisition system","confLoc":"Charlotte, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"00465773.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029097S","chronDate":"4-7 Apr 1993","isNumber":"9765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3239","citationCount":"11","articleId":"465773","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":465798,"authors":[{"name":"D.H.

One important application of ANNs is in the area of robotics. In particular, ANNs have been used to compute inverse kinematic transformations of multi-link robot manipulators. The advantage of using neural approach over the conventional inverse kinematic algorithms, is that ANNs can avoid time consuming calculations. Furthermore, in a manner typical of ANNs, it would be very easy to modify the learned associations upon changes in the structure of robot manipulators. With reference to the control paradigm, ANNs have the ability to approximate arbitrary nonlinear functions which is an essential requirement in the design of controllers for nonlinear dynamic systems. Because of their learning and adaptive features, ANNs can be trained to adaptively control various nonlinear systems. On the other hand, the conventional controllers are system specific in other words, a controller designed for a class of nonlinear systems may completely fail to control another class of nonlinear systems. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of different neural structures employed in the robotics and control paradigms. The paper describes the biological neuron and the associated terminology. The following neural structures are discussed: static neural networks, recurrent and dynamic neural networks, and fuzzy neural networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IACC.1995.465798","startPage":"451","endPage":"456","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE/IAS International Conference on Industrial Automation and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/3240/9766/00465798.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE/IAS International Conference on Industrial Automation and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IACC.1995.465798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks in robotics and control: some perspectives","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Robot control","Control systems","Nonlinear control systems","Nonlinear systems","Kinematics","Manipulators","Recurrent neural networks","System identification","Robot vision systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural nets","neurocontrollers","recurrent neural nets","feedforward neural nets","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","robotics","control","neural structures","biological neuron","static neural networks","recurrent dynamic neural networks","fuzzy neural networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/465798/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7Jan 1995","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks in robotics and control: some perspectives","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-7 Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"5032112","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks in robotics and control: some perspectives","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"00465798.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097024S","chronDate":"5-7Jan 1995","isNumber":"9766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3240","citationCount":"4","articleId":"465798","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":465817,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The different fault conditions had been tabulated and coded. Coding was done using 7 bit pattern. These codes were used to train the adaptive resonance theory 1 based online training and recognition system developed in the Centre for Artificial intelligence and Neural Network (CANN), NSS College of Engineering, Palakkad. The weight files were compressed by the technique developed by the authors and stored. The ART 1 based package uses 70 input nodes and 125 recognition layer nodes.

The ANN based approach does not involve any rigorous system modelling and iteration in real-time. But the backpropagation (BP) algorithm commonly used to train up an ANN i.e. fix its weights and thresholds is an iterative process and though off-line it requires very large number of iterations resulting in the wastage of costly computer time. In this paper a novel technique has been proposed in which the weights and thresholds obtainable by terminating the BP training process after a certain number of iterations without waiting for the convergence are used. Extensive simulation tests have been conducted terminating the training process deliberately after various number of iterations. Results have been presented for a practical and large sized power system i.e. the 81 bus Bangladesh grid system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IACC.1995.465821","startPage":"317","endPage":"322","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE/IAS International Conference on Industrial Automation and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/3240/9766/00465821.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE/IAS International Conference on Industrial Automation and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IACC.1995.465821","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power system security control using a neural network trained by forced termination of an iterative scheme","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system security","Power system control","Control systems","Neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Power system modeling","Power system simulation","Load flow analysis","Power system analysis computing","Load flow"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system security","power system control","neurocontrollers","iterative methods","multilayer perceptrons","feedforward neural nets","backpropagation","computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system security control","neural network","iterative scheme forced termination","three-layer feedforward artificial neural network","real-time iteration","backpropagation","computer time","81 bus Bangladesh grid system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/465821/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7Jan 1995","displayDocTitle":"Power system security control using a neural network trained by forced termination of an iterative scheme","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-7 Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"5032089","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power system security control using a neural network trained by forced termination of an iterative scheme","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"00465821.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036535S","chronDate":"5-7Jan 1995","isNumber":"9766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3240","articleId":"465821","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":465825,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Because robots face the same physical laws and environmental constraints as those faced by biological systems in similar tasks, the solutions they use may embrace similar principles. In this context, the development of pneumatically driven rubber actuators has been a significant advance in the realization of human-like robots. Rubber actuators are quite different from the electric and hydraulic actuators by their properties of elasticity, compactness and low inertia and hence are useful for not only industrial manipulators but also for rehabilitative prostheses. Because of their uniqueness their control schemes would require special consideration; however, very little work has been done till date in this area and only conventional control schemes have been employed. Since these actuators are functionally similar to animal muscles, the possibility exists of utilizing biologically evident motor control schemes for effecting manipulator movements as well. This paper reports the implementation of the 'equilibrium point control scheme' believed to effect musculo-skeletal control in humans and other 'higher' animals for the purposes of legged robot locomotion.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IACC.1995.465826","startPage":"291","endPage":"295","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE/IAS International Conference on Industrial Automation and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IACC.1995.465826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9766","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE/IAS International Conference on Industrial Automation and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/3240/9766/00465826.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hierarchical neural network controller for legged robots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/465826/","displayDocTitle":"A hierarchical neural network controller for legged robots","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5032084","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-7 Jan. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7Jan 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hierarchical neural network controller for legged robots","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"00465826.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041713S","chronDate":"5-7Jan 1995","isNumber":"9766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3240","citationCount":"1","articleId":"465826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":465830,"authors":[{"name":"H.V.

The DNP is developed based on the neuro-physiological evidence that neural activity of any complexity depends upon the interaction of assembly of cells called neural subpopulations. A single subpopulation of neurons is assumed to consist of a number of similar neurons that lie in close proximity. For simplicity, live neural subpopulations, namely excitatory and inhibitory, are assumed to exist in a neural population. The DNP consists of two dynamic neurons configured to function as excitatory and inhibitory neurons. A learning algorithm to adapt the weights of the subpopulation and the connecting weights between the subpopulations is developed.

The attempts have not proven to be very effective mainly due the inherent drawbacks associated with the networks and algorithms used for the purpose. These include large training time, and preestimation of the network structure and size for best performance and utilization. In this paper, the author uses a new paradigm, in which each neuron has a centre surround characteristics, along with conventional perceptron for determination of the operating condition of turbo alternators. It is shown that by the proposed method, most of the problems associated with the conventional techniques are overcome.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7Jan 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/465851/","accessionNumber":"5027244","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-7 Jan. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Detection of operating conditions of turbo alternators using neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of operating conditions of turbo alternators using neural network","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"00465851.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046656S","chronDate":"5-7Jan 1995","isNumber":"9766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3240","articleId":"465851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":465853,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Requirements of the pattern recognition algorithm to detect these faults are that it should not only show high accuracy to determine the extent of the fault, but also it must report if it can not identify a particular fault so that preventive steps can be taken in recognizing the undetected faults and updating the underlying neural network in the shortest possible time. A system based on the popular feedforward neural network (FNN) suffers a problem in satisfying these requirements of pattern recognition. In this paper a new pattern recognition scheme based on the ART2 neural network is proposed to detect the incipient faults of induction motors.

The multi-model control scheme depends on the multiple representation of a process using different models, involving two phases; (i) locating the model that best matches the process, and (ii) generating the basic control signal that will drive the system to follow the desired trajectory according to the located model.

In this paper, a new scheme is proposed and evaluated for intelligent tool status monitoring. This paper describes the possibility of sensor integration in a machining process through a neural network. Experiments were conducted to study the influence of flank wear on AE and cutting forces. This collected data is then used as training patterns for the neural network. The decision based neural network is used to integrate this information and consequently for deciding on the condition of the tool.

The channel capacity is calculated for the optimum distribution of the transmitted power. An OFDM scheme is presented which is designed to be robust to the analogue TV interference. Power and number of bits per symbol are assigned to each OFDM channel to give the maximum data rate for a given signal to interference ratio. Simulations of the proposed scheme, for 8 MHz bandwidth and interference from a system G PAL signal, show that acceptable error rate can be achieved for e.g. 27 Mbit/s and 39 Mbit/s at signal to interference ratios of -6 dB and 0 dB, respectively. The proposed scheme is suitable for the next generation terrestrial TV networks which are going to coexist with the current analogue systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel1/11/9775/00466093.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"93","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","doi":"10.1109/11.466093","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.466093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=466093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM for broadcasting in presence of analogue co-channel interference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","TV broadcasting","Digital TV","Interchannel interference","Channel capacity","Robustness","TV interference","Bit rate","Error analysis","Next generation networking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital television","television networks","television broadcasting","digital communication","television interference","video signals","frequency division multiplexing","cochannel interference","channel capacity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue co-channel interference","digital TV terrestrial broadcasting","OFDM","analogue TV services","channel capacity","transmitted power","optimum distribution","analogue TV interference","maximum data rate","simulations","bandwidth","G PAL signal","error rate","signal to interference ratios","terrestrial TV networks","39 Mbit/s","27 Mbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466093/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"OFDM for broadcasting in presence of analogue co-channel interference","volume":"41","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5068571","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM for broadcasting in presence of analogue co-channel interference","sourcePdf":"00466093.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06413S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"11","articleId":"466093","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":466178,"authors":[{"name":"P.C.

The obtained FDTD results and the developed equivalent circuit models show the importance of radiation effects at frequencies beyond 20-30 GHz, the possibilities of reducing the inductive effect of bond wires by using two parallel bond wires instead of one, and the importance of including mutual inductance elements in the equivalent circuit model to account for the crosstalk between parallel vias across a ground plane.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.466178","startPage":"2445","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/9777/00466178.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.466178","endPage":"2451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9777","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD analysis of high frequency electronic interconnection effects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466178/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"FDTD analysis of high frequency electronic interconnection effects","volume":"43","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5082743","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD analysis of high frequency electronic interconnection effects","sourcePdf":"00466178.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031362S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9777","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"40","articleId":"466178","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":466180,"authors":[{"name":"I.J.

A nonintensive, but still rigorous, alternative to this approach has been to incorporate a priori knowledge of the behavior of the fields (their asymptotic static field solutions) into the FDTD algorithm. Unfortunately, until now, this method has often resulted in instability. In this contribution an algorithm (denoted 'SFDTD' for second-order finite difference time domain) is presented which uses the static field solution technique to accurately characterize curved and angled metallic boundaries. A hitherto unpublished stability theory for this algorithm, relying on principles of energy conservation, is described and it is found that for the first time a priori knowledge of the field distribution can be incorporated into the algorithm with no possibility of instability. The accuracy of the SFDTD algorithm is compared to that of the standard FDTD method by means of two test structures for which analytic results are available.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.466180","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/9777/00466180.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.466180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9777","startPage":"2460","endPage":"2465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of curved and angled surfaces on a Cartesian mesh using a novel finite-difference time-domain algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=466180","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of curved and angled surfaces on a Cartesian mesh using a novel finite-difference time-domain algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466180/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5082745","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of curved and angled surfaces on a Cartesian mesh using a novel finite-difference time-domain algorithm","sourcePdf":"00466180.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035433S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9777","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"1","articleId":"466180","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":466181,"authors":[{"name":"M.S.

In order to handle lossy conductor transmission lines, the present approach includes the effect of finite conductivity of a lossy area, and the dissipations in metallic conductors and dielectrics are calculated directly by considering a complex permittivity for the lossy region of interest. A propagation constant formulation is used in the FEM, which avoids spurious solutions absolutely and can handle sharp metal edges in inhomogeneous electromagnetic waveguides. Numerical examples are computed for microstrip lines, finlines, and triplate strip lines. The results obtained agree well with the earlier theoretical and experimental results, and thus show the validity of the method.

We use a feedforward neural network as the nonlinear prediction model in an extended DMC-algorithm to control the pH-value. The training data set for the neural network was obtained from measurements of the inputs and outputs of the real plant operating with a PI-controller. Thus, no a priori information about the dynamics of the plant and no special operating conditions of the plant were needed to design the controller. The training algorithm used is a combination of an adaptive backpropagation algorithm that tunes the connection weights with a genetic algorithm to modify the slopes of the activation function of each neuron. This combination turned out to be very robust against getting caught in local minima and it is very insensitive to the initial settings of the weights of the network. Experimental results show that the resulting control algorithm performs much better than the conventional PI-controller which was used for the generation of the training data set.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/37.466261","startPage":"61","endPage":"66","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/5488303/9779/00466261.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/37.466261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9779","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model predictive control using neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Predictive control","Neural networks","Training data","Backpropagation algorithms","Laboratories","Inductors","Feedforward neural networks","Genetic algorithms","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["predictive control","neurocontrollers","pH control","feedforward neural nets","nonlinear control systems","control system synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model predictive control","neural networks","pH control","laboratory-scale neutralization reactor","feedforward neural network","nonlinear prediction model","extended DMC-algorithm","PI controller","training algorithm","adaptive backpropagation algorithm","activation function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466261/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Model predictive control using neural networks","volume":"15","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5081426","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model predictive control using neural networks","sourcePdf":"00466261.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051988S","chronDate":"Oct.  1995","isNumber":"9779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"117","articleId":"466261","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":466262,"authors":[{"name":"Bor-Sen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Bor-Sen Chen","id":"37087142848"},{"name":"Yu-Min Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yu-Min Cheng","id":"37087171992"},{"name":"Ching-Hsiang Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Hsiang Lee","id":"37087253520"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1066-033X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-000X"}],"articleNumber":"466262","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":125,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":585},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=466262","abstract":"Mixed H/sub 2//H/sub /spl infin// control designs are quite useful for robust performance design for systems under parameter perturbation and uncertain disturbance.

In order to avoid this difficulty, the numerical approximation of the highly nonlinear optimal control law by means of a neural network has been proposed, and an algorithm which allows the network to learn the required control actions by means of an iterative optimization process has been developed. In particular, this process involves the simultaneous minimization of both the time necessary to complete the control action as well as the final state error. It has the advantage of being very general, since no a-priori assumptions are made about the plant, and of being very flexible in that it permits the inclusion of problem-specific constraints. The performance of the technique has been investigated by applying it to both a second- and a fourth-order test plant, with very positive results being obtained in both cases.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/37.466265","pdfPath":"/iel1/5488303/9779/00466265.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"33","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/37.466265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9779","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-optimal control by means of neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466265/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Time-optimal control by means of neural networks","volume":"15","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5081422","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-optimal control by means of neural networks","sourcePdf":"00466265.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034051S","chronDate":"Oct.  1995","isNumber":"9779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"9","articleId":"466265","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":466339,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

TEMPEST, which has been made available on the NCSA and other computing centers, combines together techniques for analysis of the transverse electric (TE) and the transverse magnetic (TM) polarizations, oblique incidence, highly dispersive materials, and a technique for synthesis of partially coherent optical images. The solution is based on the time-domain finite-difference method, but exploits the power of massively parallel computer architectures. Equations suitable for massively parallel implementation are given for oblique incidence, both polarizations and dispersive materials. Computer time per iteration cycle is constant irrespective of the polarization and angle of incidence. However, the total simulation time for convergence was found to be dominated by physical scattering phenomena. Convergence for the TM polarization is 1.5 times slower than the TE polarization because of edge currents, and oblique incidence is 2 times slower than normal incidence owing to artificial reflection from the domain boundaries. A typical simulation time is three to five minutes with 256 k (1 k=1024) simulation nodes on a CM-2 with 8 k processors. The effectiveness of the program for photolithographic applications is demonstrated by considering the effects of subtle changes in phase-shifting mask topography on the optical images.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466339/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","volume":"14","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5075021","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Massively parallel electromagnetic simulation for photolithographic applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Massively parallel electromagnetic simulation for photolithographic applications","sourcePdf":"00466339.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051774S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"10","articleId":"466339","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":466344,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Long Wey","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Chin-Long Wey","id":"37267240400"},{"name":"Shoba Krishnan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada","Department of Electrical Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Shoba Krishnan","id":"37275777400"},{"name":"S.

Self-correcting, self-compensating, or self-calibrating techniques has been employed in analog-to-digital (A/D) converters to eliminate errors caused by offset and low frequency noise and cancel the error effect. For real-time applications, however, it is rather difficult to achieve validation of the converted data in the presence of faulty switching element(s). In this paper, fault behaviors and test generation of a current-mode A/D converter are addressed. Results show that the converter achieves full testability with two test currents. In addition, an A/D converter with concurrent error detection capability is proposed. The converter detects all transient faults.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466344/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"14","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5075026","displayDocTitle":"Test generation and concurrent error detection in current-mode A/D converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Test generation and concurrent error detection in current-mode A/D converters","sourcePdf":"00466344.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032862S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"10","articleId":"466344","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":466385,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The behavior or the load and its correlation with parameters affecting it (e.g. weather variables) are decomposed into three distinct trends of weekly, daily, and hourly. Each trend is modeled by a separate module containing several multi-layer feed-forward ANNs trained by the back-propagation learning rule. The forecasts produced by each module are then combined by adaptive filters to arrive at the final forecast. During the forecasting phase, the parameters of the ANNs within each module are adaptively changed in response to the system's latest forecast accuracy. The performance of the forecaster has been tested on data from these 20 utilities with excellent results. The on-line performance of the system has also been quite satisfactory and superior to other forecasting packages used by the utilities. Moreover, the forecaster is robust, easy to use, and produces accurate results in the case of rapid weather changes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.466468","startPage":"1716","endPage":"1722","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/9784/00466468.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.466468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9784","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive modular artificial neural network hourly load forecaster and its implementation at electric utilities","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Load forecasting","Weather forecasting","Student members","Power industry","Robustness","Costs","Maintenance","Economic forecasting","Power system security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load forecasting","multilayer perceptrons","feedforward neural nets","adaptive filters","power system analysis computing","electricity supply industry","backpropagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modular artificial neural network","hourly load forecaster","electric utilities","USA","weather variables","weekly trend","hourly trend","daily trend","multi-layer feed-forward ANN","back-propagation learning rule","adaptive filters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466468/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1995","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive modular artificial neural network hourly load forecaster and its implementation at electric utilities","volume":"10","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5054660","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive modular artificial neural network hourly load forecaster and its implementation at electric utilities","sourcePdf":"00466468.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090161S","chronDate":"Aug.  1995","isNumber":"9784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"155","articleId":"466468","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":466472,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The parameters of the rule base are then tuned through a training process, so that the output of the FNN adequately matches the available historical load data. Once trained, the FNN can be used to forecast future loads. Test results show that the FNN can forecast future loads with an accuracy comparable to that of neural networks, while its training is much faster than that of neural networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/9784/00466494.pdf","startPage":"1518","endPage":"1524","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/59.466494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.466494","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9784","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=466494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short term load forecasting using fuzzy neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load forecasting","Fuzzy neural networks","Fuzzy systems","Fuzzy control","Power system modeling","Autoregressive processes","Neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Fuzzy sets","Economic forecasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system analysis computing","load forecasting","fuzzy neural nets","digital simulation","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system","short term load forecasting","fuzzy neural network","rule base","historical load data","training","accuracy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466494/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Short term load forecasting using fuzzy neural networks","volume":"10","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5054633","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short term load forecasting using fuzzy neural networks","sourcePdf":"00466494.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097338S","chronDate":"Aug.  1995","isNumber":"9784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"131","articleId":"466494","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":466502,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Smaller, isolated power systems, which are more vulnerable to serious disturbances, have operating characteristics that require somewhat different guidelines, due to their lower inertia, limited reserves, and lack of access to off-system assistance.

Although the optimization method used belongs to the traditional class of combinatorial integer programming, the algorithm provides good speed for real-time application.

Several factors oblige utilities to operate their systems-particularly transmission systems-at or close to their capacities. Few methods for scheduling electric generating units, however, take security into account. Utilities, therefore, may inadvertently risk overloading critical transmission lines if units are not rescheduled. Without advance planning a utility may incur significant costs if it must reschedule generation retroactively. This paper presents a practical method to account for security constraints when scheduling electric generating units. The results indicate that this method obtains lower-cost solutions faster than if the security constraints are considered retroactively.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.466520","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/9784/00466520.pdf","startPage":"1329","endPage":"1342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.466520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9784","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A direct method for security-constrained unit commitment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=466520","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466520/","displayDocTitle":"A direct method for security-constrained unit commitment","volume":"10","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5054607","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A direct method for security-constrained unit commitment","sourcePdf":"00466520.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043524S","chronDate":"Aug.  1995","isNumber":"9784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"143","articleId":"466520","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":466523,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8950"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0679"}],"articleNumber":"466523","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":429,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7281},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=466523","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load modeling","Load flow","Power system modeling","Power system dynamics","Power system simulation","Power system stability","Power system transients","Voltage","Power engineering and energy","Induction motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load flow","power system analysis computing","power system stability","power system transients"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power flow simulation","dynamic performance simulation","standard load models","load modeling","advanced load modeling","data exchange","production-grade simulation programs","transient stability","longer-term dynamics","small-disturbance stability programs","load bus","static loads","discharge lighting load","induction motor load","synchronous motor load","transformer saturation"]}],"abstract":"We recommend standard load models for power flow and dynamic simulation programs.

In this method, the power system constraints, e.g. load demand, spinning reserve, transmission capacity and environmental constraints, are relaxed by using Lagrangian multipliers, and quadratic penalty terms associated with power system load demand balance are added to the Lagrangian objective function. Then, the decomposition and coordination technique is used, and nonseparable quadratic penalty terms are replaced by linearization around the solution obtained from the previous iteration. In order to improve the convergence property, the exactly convex quadratic terms of decision variables are added to the objective function as strongly convex, differentiable and separable auxiliary functions. The overall problem is decomposed into N subproblems, multipliers and penalty coefficients are updated in the dual problem and power system constraints are satisfied iteratively. The corresponding unit commitment subproblems are solved by dynamic programming, and the economic dispatch with transmission and environmental constraints is solved by an efficient network flow programming algorithm. The augmented Lagrangian relaxation method enhanced by the decomposition and coordination techniques avoids oscillations associated with piece-wise linear cost functions. Numerical results indicate that the proposed approach is fast and efficient in dealing with numerous power system constraints.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.466524","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/9784/00466524.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.466524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9784","startPage":"1294","endPage":"1301","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-term generation scheduling with transmission and environmental constraints using an augmented Lagrangian relaxation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=466524","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Short-term generation scheduling with transmission and environmental constraints using an augmented Lagrangian relaxation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466524/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5054603","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-term generation scheduling with transmission and environmental constraints using an augmented Lagrangian relaxation","sourcePdf":"00466524.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098448S","chronDate":"Aug.  1995","isNumber":"9784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"398","articleId":"466524","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":466526,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The charge and discharge process in a cool energy storage system is typically a 24-hour cycle. In this paper, an optimal controller for this process is designed that minimizes the operating costs of the storage facility. A 24-hour load-forecast model is developed to achieve dynamic system response to the variations in the ambient weather conditions. Hourly building cooling loads are predicted over the 24-hour horizon to schedule adequate charging of storage to meet peak-period loads. The degradation of performance of the optimal control algorithm attributable to the lack of perfect foresight of weather conditions and associated building loads is analyzed via a case study.

A new mixed model-matching robustness formulation is used in the design. The model-matching part requires a nominal damping controller, and the robustness part allows for the tuning of the controller. The formulation simplifies the selection of weights for tuning the controller. The procedure is used to design TCSC controllers to enhance the local mode damping in a single-machine power system and the inter-area mode damping in a 2-area 4-machine power system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Frequency domain analysis","Tuning","Damping","Power system modeling","Control systems","Thyristors","Robust control","Power system control","Power capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system control","control system synthesis","H/sup /spl infin// control","robust control","tuning","damping","power system stability","power system interconnection","frequency-domain synthesis","reactive power control","compensation","thyristor applications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system","robust frequency domain optimization technique","series compensation damping controllers","tuning","H/sub /spl infin// optimization","control system design procedure","thyristor controlled series compensation","mixed model-matching robustness","weights selection","local mode damping"]}],"doi":"10.1109/59.466534","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/9784/00466534.pdf","startPage":"1219","endPage":"1225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.466534","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust frequency domain optimization technique for tuning series compensation damping controllers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=466534","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A robust frequency domain optimization technique for tuning series compensation damping controllers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466534/","volume":"10","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5054593","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust frequency domain optimization technique for tuning series compensation damping controllers","sourcePdf":"00466534.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026855S","chronDate":"Aug.  1995","isNumber":"9784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"86","articleId":"466534","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":466566,"authors":[{"name":"C.R.

A novel polymer optical coupler, using center-fed mode mixing for multimode waveguide, is demonstrated experimentally for use in a mixed-signal mode environment. This coupler has lower loss and space requirement than the traditional Y-junction coupler. A limitation of this type of coupler is the small separation of the output beams.

The feature of COPIS is passive sensing of the omnidirectional image of the environment, in real-time (at the frame rate of a TV camera), using a conic mirror. COPIS is a suitable sensor for visual navigation in a real world environment. We report here a method for navigating a robot by detecting the azimuth of each object in the omnidirectional image. The azimuth is matched with the given environmental map. The robot can precisely estimate its own location and motion (the velocity of the robot) because COPIS observes a 360/spl deg/ view around the robot, even when all edges are not extracted correctly from the omnidirectional image. The robot can avoid colliding against unknown obstacles and estimate locations by detecting azimuth changes, while moving about in the environment. Under the assumption of the known motion of the robot, an environmental map of an indoor scene is generated by monitoring azimuth change in the image.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/9786/00466602.pdf","startPage":"634","endPage":"648","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/70.466602","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.466602","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9786","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=466602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Map-based navigation for a mobile robot with omnidirectional image sensor COPIS","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Navigation","Mobile robots","Azimuth","Image sensors","Robot sensing systems","TV","Robot vision systems","Cameras","Mirrors","Object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","path planning","navigation","image sensors","motion estimation","image processing","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["map-based navigation","mobile robot","omnidirectional image sensor","COPIS","conic projection image sensor","conic mirror","visual navigation","motion estimation","obstacle avoidance","azimuth matching"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466602/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"Map-based navigation for a mobile robot with omnidirectional image sensor COPIS","volume":"11","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5077611","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Map-based navigation for a mobile robot with omnidirectional image sensor COPIS","sourcePdf":"00466602.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044512S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"104","articleId":"466602","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":466606,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The unification is based on an equivalence between end-effector measurements and constraints imposed by the closure of kinematic loops. Errors are allocated to the joints such that the loop equations are satisfied exactly, which eliminates the issue of equation scaling and simplifies the treatment of multi-loop mechanisms. For the experiments reported here, no external measuring devices are used; instead we rely on measurements of displacements in some of the passive joints of the devices. Using a priori estimates of the statistics of the measurement errors and the parameter errors, the method estimates the parameters and their accuracy, and tests for unmodeled factors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466613/","volume":"11","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"5083778","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An implicit loop method for kinematic calibration and its application to closed-chain mechanisms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An implicit loop method for kinematic calibration and its application to closed-chain mechanisms","sourcePdf":"00466613.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031334S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"119","articleId":"466613","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":466632,"authors":[{"name":"A.

While several previous papers have looked at hyperplane partitioning of iteration spaces to reduce communication traffic, the problem of deriving the optimal tiling parameters for minimal communication in loops with general affine index expressions has remained open. Our paper solves this open problem by presenting a method for deriving an optimal hyperparallelepiped tiling of iteration spaces for minimal communication in multiprocessors with caches. We show that the same theoretical framework can also be used to determine optimal tiling parameters for both data and loop partitioning in distributed memory multicomputers. Our framework uses matrices to represent iteration and data space mappings and the notion of uniformly intersecting references to capture temporal locality in array references. We introduce the notion of data footprints to estimate the communication traffic between processors and use linear algebraic methods and lattice theory to compute precisely the size of data footprints. We have implemented this framework in a compiler for Alewife, a distributed shared-memory multiprocessor.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/71.466632","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/9787/00466632.pdf","startPage":"943","endPage":"962","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.466632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic partitioning of parallel loops and data arrays for distributed shared-memory multiprocessors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=466632","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466632/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic partitioning of parallel loops and data arrays for distributed shared-memory multiprocessors","volume":"6","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5091535","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic partitioning of parallel loops and data arrays for distributed shared-memory multiprocessors","sourcePdf":"00466632.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024312S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"65","articleId":"466632","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":466633,"authors":[{"name":"K.

These are products of complete binary trees, shuffle-exchange and de Bruijn networks. It is shown that all of these are powerful architectures for parallel computation, as evidenced by their ability to efficiently emulate numerous other architectures. In particular, r-dimensional grids and r-dimensional meshes of trees can be embedded efficiently in products of these graphs, i.e. either as a subgraph or with small constant dilation and congestion. In addition, the shuffle-exchange network can be embedded in an r-dimensional product of shuffle-exchange networks with dilation cost 2r and congestion cost 2. Similarly, the de Bruijn network can be embedded in an r-dimensional product of de Bruijn networks with dilation cost r and congestion cost 4. Moreover, it is well known that shuffle-exchange and de Bruijn graphs can emulate the hypercube with a small constant slowdown for \"normal\" algorithms. This means that their product versions can also emulate these hypercube algorithms with constant slowdown.

It has been shown that using multiplier blocks to exploit redundancy across the coefficients results in significant reductions in complexity over methods using canonic signed-digit (CSD) representation, which in turn are less complex than standard binary representation. Three new algorithms for the design of multiplier blocks are described: an efficient modification to an existing algorithm, a new algorithm giving better results, and a hybrid of these two which trades off performance against computation time. Significant savings in filter implementation cost over existing techniques result in all three cases. For a given wordlength, it was found that a threshold set size exists above which the multiplier block is extremely likely to be optimal.

This is particularly true if a speaker is exposed to demanding workload stress or noise. For recognition systems to be successful in applications susceptible to stress, speech recognizers should address the adverse conditions experienced by the user. The authors consider the problem of improved recognition training for speech recognition for various stressed speaking conditions (e.g., slow, loud, and Lombard effect speaking styles). The main objective is to devise a training procedure that produces a hidden Markov model recognizer that better characterizes a given stressed speaking style, without the need for directly collecting such stressed data. The novel approach is to construct a word production model using a previously suggested source generator framework [Hansen 1994], by employing knowledge of the statistical nature of duration and spectral variation of speech under stress. This model is used in turn to produce simulated stressed speech training tokens from neutral speech tokens. The token generation training method is shown to improve isolated word recognition by 24% for Lombard speech when compared to a neutral trained isolated word recognizer. Further results are reported for isolated and keyword recognition scenarios.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/9789/00466654.pdf","startPage":"415","endPage":"421","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust speech recognition training via duration and spectral-based stress token generation","doi":"10.1109/89.466654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9789","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.466654","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=466654","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466654/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Robust speech recognition training via duration and spectral-based stress token generation","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5072621","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"3","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust speech recognition training via duration and spectral-based stress token generation","sourcePdf":"00466654.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024874S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"24","articleId":"466654","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":466655,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.L.

The focus of the study is to achieve robust recognition in diverse environmental conditions through the formulation of feature enhancement and stress equalization algorithms under the framework of source generator theory. The generator framework is considered as a means of modeling production variation under stressful speaking conditions. A multi-dimensional stress equalization procedure is formulated that produces recognition features less sensitive to varying factors caused by stress. A feature enhancement algorithm is employed based on iterative techniques previously derived for enhancement of speech in varying background noise environments. Combined stress equalization and feature enhancement reduces average word error rates across 10 noisy stressful conditions by -38.7% (e.g., noisy loud, angry, and Lombard effect stress conditions, etc.). The results suggest that the combination of a flexible source generator framework to address stressed speaking conditions, and a feature enhancement algorithm that adapts based on speech-specific constraints, can be effective in reducing the consequences of stress and noise for robust automatic recognition.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466655/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5072620","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"3","issue":"5","displayDocTitle":"Source generator equalization and enhancement of spectral properties for robust speech recognition in noise and stress","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Source generator equalization and enhancement of spectral properties for robust speech recognition in noise and stress","sourcePdf":"00466655.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027898S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"27","articleId":"466655","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":466658,"authors":[{"name":"W.R.

First, it is shown that in many high-rate VQ systems the quantization distortion approaches a simple quadratically weighted error measure, where the weighting matrix is a \"sensitivity matrix\" that is an extension of the concept of the scalar sensitivity. The approximate performance of VQ systems that train and quantize using mismatched distortion measures is derived, and is used to construct better distortion measures. Second, these results are used to determine the performance of LPC vector quantizers, as measured by the log spectral distortion (LSD) measure, which have been trained using other error measures, such as mean-squared (MSE) or weighted mean-squared error (WMSE) measures of LEPC parameters, reflection coefficients and transforms thereof, and line spectral pair (LSP) frequencies. Computationally efficient algorithms for computing the sensitivity matrices of these parameters are described. In particular, it is shown that the sensitivity matrix for the LSP frequencies is diagonal, implying that a WMSE measured LSP frequencies converges to the LSD measure in high-rate VQ systems. Experimental results to support the theoretical performance estimates are provided.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/89.466658","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/9789/00466658.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.466658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9789","startPage":"367","endPage":"381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theoretical analysis of the high-rate vector quantization of LPC parameters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=466658","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical analysis of the high-rate vector quantization of LPC parameters","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466658/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5072617","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical analysis of the high-rate vector quantization of LPC parameters","sourcePdf":"00466658.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057017S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"124","articleId":"466658","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":466659,"authors":[{"name":"V.V.

Despite the good recognition performance that these systems achieve on average in large vocabulary applications, there is a large variability in performance across speakers. Performance degrades dramatically when the user is radically different from the training population. A popular technique that can improve the performance and robustness of a speech recognition system is adapting speech models to the speaker, and more generally to the channel and the task. In continuous mixture-density HMMs the number of component densities is typically very large, and it may not be feasible to acquire a sufficient amount of adaptation data for robust maximum-likelihood estimates. To solve this problem, the authors propose a constrained estimation technique for Gaussian mixture densities. The algorithm is evaluated on the large-vocabulary Wall Street Journal corpus for both native and nonnative speakers of American English. For nonnative speakers, the recognition error rate is approximately halved with only a small amount of adaptation data, and it approaches the speaker-independent accuracy achieved for native speakers. For native speakers, the recognition performance after adaptation improves to the accuracy of speaker-dependent systems that use six times as much training data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speaker adaptation using constrained estimation of Gaussian mixtures","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","doi":"10.1109/89.466659","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/9789/00466659.pdf","startPage":"357","endPage":"366","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.466659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9789","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=466659","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466659/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Speaker adaptation using constrained estimation of Gaussian mixtures","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5072616","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speaker adaptation using constrained estimation of Gaussian mixtures","sourcePdf":"00466659.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051436S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"238","articleId":"466659","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":466661,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Huo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","ATR Interpreting Telecommunications Research Laboratories, Kyoto, Japan"],"lastName":"Qiang Huo","id":"38521947900"},{"name":"Chorkin Chan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Chorkin Chan","id":"37351256700"},{"name":"Chin Hui Lee","affiliation":["Speech Research Department, AT and T Bell Laboratories, Inc., Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Chin Hui Lee","id":"37280405600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6676"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2353"}],"articleNumber":"466661","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":272},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Hidden Markov models","Speech recognition","State estimation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Computer science","Prototypes","Parameter estimation","Inference algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition","Bayes methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","hidden Markov models","maximum likelihood estimation","adaptive estimation","Gaussian processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian adaptive learning","hidden Markov model","speech recognition","discrete hidden Markov model","semi-continuous HMM","Gaussian mixture state observation densities","forward-backward MAP","maximum a posteriori","segmental MAP algorithm","segmental quasi-Bayes algorithm","state-specific mixture coefficients","prior densities","moment estimates","prior parameter specification","speaker adaptive HMM"]}],"abstract":"A theoretical framework for Bayesian adaptive training of the parameters of a discrete hidden Markov model (DHMM) and of a semi-continuous HMM (SCHMM) with Gaussian mixture state observation densities is presented.

In the paper, significant excitation refers primarily to the instant of glottal closure within a pitch period in voiced speech. The method is based on the global phase characteristics of minimum phase signals. The average slope of the unwrapped phase of the short-time Fourier transform of linear prediction residual is calculated as a function of time. Instants where the phase slope function makes a positive zero-crossing are identified as significant excitations. The method is discussed in a source-filter context of speech production. The method is not sensitive to the characteristics of the filter. The influence of the type, length, and position of the analysis window is discussed.

The simulation of two typical examples shows that the accuracy of this proposed algorithm is more accurate than any other existing increased accuracy algorithms by using the sinusoidal transforms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete interpolation using the discrete cosine transform with the mapping of the boundary conditions","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/97.466705","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/97/9791/00466705.pdf","startPage":"185","endPage":"187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/97.466705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9791","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=466705","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466705/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Discrete interpolation using the discrete cosine transform with the mapping of the boundary conditions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5088591","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete interpolation using the discrete cosine transform with the mapping of the boundary conditions","sourcePdf":"00466705.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042054S","chronDate":"Oct.  1995","isNumber":"9791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"4","articleId":"466705","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":466717,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

Unfortunately, previous collision detection algorithms are too slow for interactive use. The paper presents a new algorithm for rigid or articulated objects that meets performance goals through a form of time critical computing. The algorithm supports progressive refinement, detecting collisions between successively tighter approximations to object surfaces as the application allows it more processing time. The algorithm uses simple four dimensional geometry to approximate motion, and hierarchies of spheres to approximate three dimensional surfaces at multiple resolutions. In a sample application, the algorithm allows interactive performance that is not possible with a good previous algorithm. In particular, the new algorithm provides acceptable accuracy while maintaining a steady and high frame rate, which in some cases improves on the previous algorithm's rate by more than two orders of magnitude.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","startPage":"218","endPage":"230","doi":"10.1109/2945.466717","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2945.466717","pdfPath":"/iel1/2945/9792/00466717.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Collision detection for interactive graphics applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466717/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Collision detection for interactive graphics applications","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5075261","volume":"1","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collision detection for interactive graphics applications","sourcePdf":"00466717.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050131S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"196","articleId":"466717","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":466792,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The main difficulty is the integration of low-level, pixel-based local image features to obtain global object-based descriptions. Active contours in the form of snakes, balloons, and level-set modeling techniques have been proposed that satisfactorily address this question for certain applications. However, these methods require manual initialization, do not always perform well near sharp protrusions or indentations, or often cross gaps. We propose an approach inspired by these methods and a shock-based representation of shape in terms of parts, protrusions, and bends. Since initially it is not clear where the objects or their parts are, parts are hypothesized in the form of fourth order shocks randomly initialized in homogeneous areas of images. These shocks then form evolving contours, or bubbles, which grow, shrink, merge, split and disappear to capture the objects in the image. In the homogeneous areas of the image bubbles deform by a reaction-diffusion process. In the inhomogeneous areas, indicated by differential properties computed from low-level processes such as edge-detection, texture, optical-flow and stereo, etc., bubbles do not deform. As such, the randomly initialized bubbles integrate low-level information and, in the process, segment the figures from the ground.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466792/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5032555","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Image segmentation by reaction-diffusion bubbles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image segmentation by reaction-diffusion bubbles","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00466792.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039819S","chronDate":"20-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"9796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3245","citationCount":"65","articleId":"466792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":466804,"authors":[{"name":"Jiang Yu Zheng","affiliation":["Fac. of Comput.

We find very simple and direct methods to fulfill this objective; linear equations for multiple lights illumination, and a 1st-order differential equation for single light illumination. The motion of specular reflection has nice global characteristics in EPI. The surface types range from very shiny metal surfaces to surfaces with only week specular reflectance. We give both simulation and experiments on real objects.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1995.466804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9796","startPage":"72","endPage":"79","pdfPath":"/iel2/3245/9796/00466804.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1995.466804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shape and model from specular motion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reflectivity","Surface texture","Cameras","Equations","Optical reflection","Motion estimation","Lighting","Shape measurement","Computer science","Systems engineering and theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","motion estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["specular motion","visual characteristics","specular surfaces","rotation","continuous images","linear equations","1st-order differential equation","simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Shape and model from specular motion","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466804/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5032543","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shape and model from specular motion","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00466804.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0336S","chronDate":"20-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"9796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3245","citationCount":"10","articleId":"466804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":466816,"authors":[{"name":"R.I.

Depth-from-defocus offers a direct solution to fast and dense range estimation. It is computationally efficient as it circumvents the correspondence problem faced by stereo and feature tracking in structure-from-motion. However, accurate depth estimation requires theoretical and practical solutions to a variety of problems including the recovery of textureless surfaces, precise blur estimation, and magnification variations caused by defocusing. Both textured and textureless surfaces are recovered using an illumination pattern that is projected via the same optical path used to acquire images. The illumination pattern is optimized to ensure maximum accuracy and spatial resolution in the computed depth. The relative blurring in two images is computed using a narrow-band linear operator that is designed by considering all the optical, sensing and computational elements of the depth-from-defocus system. Defocus-invariant magnification is achieved by the use of an additional aperture in the imaging optics. A prototype focus range sensor has been developed that produces up to 512/spl times/480 depth estimates at 30 Hz with an accuracy better than 0.3%. Several experimental results are included to demonstrate the performance of the sensor.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9796","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel2/3245/9796/00466826.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1995.466826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1995.466826","startPage":"995","endPage":"1001","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time focus range sensor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466826/","displayDocTitle":"Real-time focus range sensor","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 1995","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5028125","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time focus range sensor","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00466826.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038812S","chronDate":"20-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"9796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3245","citationCount":"40","articleId":"466826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":466839,"authors":[{"name":"J.-M.

The approach combines nonlinear causal Markov models defined on hierarchical graph structures, with standard bayesian estimation theory. Two random processes defined on simple hierarchical graphs (quadtrees or \"ternary graphs\") are introduced to represent the multiresolution observations at hand and the hidden labels to be estimated. An optimal algorithm (inspired from the Viterbi algorithm) is developed to compute the bayesian estimates on the hierarchical graph structures. Estimates are obtained within two passes on the graph structure. This algorithm is non-iterative and yields a per pixel computational complexity which is independent of image size. This approach is compared to the multiscale algorithm proposed by (Bouman et al., 1994) for single-resolution image segmentation (that we have extended for multiresolution data fusion).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel2/3245/9796/00466839.pdf","startPage":"908","endPage":"913","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1995.466839","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1995.466839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9796","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=466839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical statistical models for the fusion of multiresolution image data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image resolution","Bayesian methods","Iterative algorithms","Random processes","Estimation theory","Viterbi algorithm","Pixel","Application software","Computer vision","Image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","sensor fusion","Markov processes","graph theory","Bayes methods","estimation theory","image segmentation","image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical statistical models","multiresolution image data fusion","nonlinear hierarchical algorithms","low-level vision","nonlinear causal Markov models","hierarchical graph structures","bayesian estimation theory","random processes","simple hierarchical graphs","quadtrees","ternary graphs","optimal algorithm","Viterbi algorithm","bayesian estimates","computational complexity","image size","single-resolution image segmentation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466839/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical statistical models for the fusion of multiresolution image data","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5028112","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical statistical models for the fusion of multiresolution image data","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00466839.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051873S","chronDate":"20-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"9796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3245","citationCount":"20","articleId":"466839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":466843,"authors":[{"name":"R.I.

This 3/spl times/3/spl times/3 tensor plays a role in the analysis of scenes from three views analogous to the role played by the fundamental matrix in the two-view case. In particular, the trifocal tensor maybe computed by a linear algorithm from a set of 13 line correspondences in three views. It is further shown in this paper to be essentially identical to a set of coefficients introduced by Shashua (1994) to effect point transfer in the three-view case. This observation means that the 13-line algorithm may be extended to allow for the computation of the trifocal tensor given any mixture of sufficiently many line and point correspondences. From the trifocal tensor, the camera image matrices may be computed, and the scene may be reconstructed. For unrelated uncalibrated cameras, this reconstruction is unique up to projectivity. Thus, projective reconstruction of a set of lines and points may be reconstructed linearly from three views.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466843/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jun 1995","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5028108","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A linear method for reconstruction from lines and points","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A linear method for reconstruction from lines and points","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00466843.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051502S","chronDate":"20-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"9796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3245","citationCount":"93","articleId":"466843","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":466855,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The basic idea is to identify sets of constraints that are diagnostic of a movement: expressed using body-centered coordinates such as joint angles and in force only during a particular movement. Assuming the availability of Cartesian tracking data, we develop techniques for a representation of movements defined by space curves in subspaces of a \"phase space.\" The phase space has axes of joint angles and torso location and attitude, and the axes of the subspaces are subsets of the axes of the phase space. Using this representation we develop a system for learning new movements from ground truth data by searching for constraints. We then use the learned representation for recognizing movements in unsegmented data. We train and test the system on nine fundamental steps from classical ballet performed by two dancers; the system accurately recognizes the movements in the unsegmented stream of motion.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1995.466880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9796","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel2/3245/9796/00466880.pdf","endPage":"630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognition of human body motion using phase space constraints","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1995.466880","startPage":"624","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=466880","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Recognition of human body motion using phase space constraints","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466880/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5028071","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognition of human body motion using phase space constraints","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00466880.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04157S","chronDate":"20-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"9796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3245","citationCount":"157","articleId":"466880","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":466881,"authors":[{"name":"I.A.

The dominant background changes in the image plane mostly due to camera operations and motion (zoom, pan, tilt, track etc.). We address the problem of computation of the dominant image transformation over time and demonstrate how this can be effectively used for efficient video representation through video mosaicing and image registration. We formulate the problem of dominant component estimation as that of model based robust estimation using M estimators with direct, multi resolution methods. In addition to 2D affine and plane projective models, that have been used in the past for describing image motion using direct methods, we also employ a true 3D model of motion and scene structure imaged with uncalibrated cameras. This model parameterizes the image motion as that due to a planar component and a parallax component. For rigid 3D scenes imaged under camera motion only, least squares (LS) methods with the plane and parallax parameterization are also presented. Furthermore, in the context of robust estimation, in contrast with previous approaches for similar problems, our algorithm employs an automatic computation of a scale parameter that is crucial in rejecting the non dominant components as outliers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1995.466886","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel2/3245/9796/00466886.pdf","startPage":"583","endPage":"590","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1995.466886","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9796","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-based 2D&3D dominant motion estimation for mosaicing and video representation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466886/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Model-based 2D&3D dominant motion estimation for mosaicing and video representation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5028065","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-based 2D&3D dominant motion estimation for mosaicing and video representation","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00466886.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058567S","chronDate":"20-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"9796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3245","citationCount":"53","articleId":"466886","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":466894,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

The object recognition problem is addressed as the problem of best describing a match between a hypothesized object and an image. The normalized correlation coefficient is used as a measure of the match. Templates are generated on-line during the search by transforming model images. Simulated annealing reduces the search time by orders of magnitude with respect to an exhaustive search. The algorithm is applied to the problem of how landmarks, e.g., traffic signs, can be recognized by a navigating robot. We illustrate the performance of our algorithm with real-world images of complicated scenes with traffic signs. False positive matches occur only for templates with very small information content. To avoid false positive matches, we propose a method to select model images for robust object recognition by measuring the information content of the model images. The algorithm works well in noisy images for model images with high information content.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1995.466895","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","startPage":"523","endPage":"530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1995.466895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9796","pdfPath":"/iel2/3245/9796/00466895.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object recognition","Simulated annealing","Signal processing algorithms","Image recognition","Computer vision","Computational modeling","Robots","Robustness","Matched filters","Radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object recognition","simulated annealing","robot vision","noise","image matching","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast object recognition","noisy images","simulated annealing","hypothesized object","image match","normalized correlation coefficient","search time","exhaustive search","navigating robot","real-world images","complicated scenes","traffic signs","false positive matches","robust object recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fast object recognition in noisy images using simulated annealing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466895/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5028056","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jun 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast object recognition in noisy images using simulated annealing","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00466895.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038214S","chronDate":"20-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"9796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3245","citationCount":"34","articleId":"466895","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":466898,"authors":[{"name":"D.

But what if we only have one real view available, such as a scanned passport photo-can we still recognize faces under different poses? Given one real view at a known pose, it is still possible to use the view-based approach by exploiting prior knowledge of faces to generate virtual views, or views of the face as seen from different poses. To represent prior knowledge, we use 2D example views of prototype faces under different rotations. We develop example-based techniques for applying the rotation seen in the prototypes to essentially \"rotate\" the single real view which is available. Next, the combined set of one real and multiple virtual views is used as example views for a view-based, pose-invariant face recognizer. Oar experiments suggest that among the techniques for expressing prior knowledge of faces, 2D example-based approaches should be considered alongside the more standard 3D modeling techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face recognition from one example view","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1995.466898","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel2/3245/9796/00466898.pdf","startPage":"500","endPage":"507","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1995.466898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9796","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=466898","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466898/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Face recognition from one example view","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5028053","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face recognition from one example view","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00466898.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044724S","chronDate":"20-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"9796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3245","citationCount":"199","articleId":"466898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":466899,"authors":[{"name":"C.

In the past, it has been used to search images for instances of a model that has been translated or translated and scaled by finding transformations that bring a large number of model features close to image features, and vice versa. The Hausdorff distance is reliable even when the image contains multiple objects, noise, spurious features, and occlusions. We apply it to the task of locating an affine transformation of a model in an image; this corresponds to determining the pose of a planar object that has undergone weak perspective projection. We develop a rasterised approach to the search and a number of techniques that allow us to quickly locate all transformations of the model that satisfy two quality criteria; we can also quickly locate only the best transformation. We discuss an implementation of this approach, and present some examples of its use.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1995.466904","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel2/3245/9796/00466904.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1995.466904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9796","startPage":"457","endPage":"464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Locating objects using the Hausdorff distance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=466904","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Locating objects using the Hausdorff distance","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466904/","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 1995","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5028047","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Locating objects using the Hausdorff distance","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00466904.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114973S","chronDate":"20-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"9796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3245","citationCount":"64","articleId":"466904","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":466915,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

Parametric flow models (for example affine) are popular for estimating motion in rigid scenes. We observe that within local regions in space and time, such models not only accurately model non-rigid facial motions but also provide a concise description of the motion in terms of a small number of parameters. These parameters are intuitively related to the motion of facial features during facial expressions and we show how expressions such as anger, happiness, surprise, fear, disgust and sadness can be recognized from the local parametric motions in the presence of significant head motion. The motion tracking and expression recognition approach performs with high accuracy in extensive laboratory experiments involving 40 subjects as well as in television and movie sequences.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1995.466915","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel2/3245/9796/00466915.pdf","startPage":"374","endPage":"381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1995.466915","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9796","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking and recognizing rigid and non-rigid facial motions using local parametric models of image motion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=466915","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466915/","displayDocTitle":"Tracking and recognizing rigid and non-rigid facial motions using local parametric models of image motion","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5028036","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking and recognizing rigid and non-rigid facial motions using local parametric models of image motion","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00466915.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054991S","chronDate":"20-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"9796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3245","citationCount":"240","articleId":"466915","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":466916,"authors":[{"name":"I.A.

This produces a muscle based representation of facial motion, which is then used to recognize facial expressions in two different ways. The first method uses the physics based model directly, by recognizing expressions through comparison of estimated muscle activations. The second method uses the physics based model to generate spatio temporal motion energy templates of the whole face for each different expression. These simple, biologically plausible motion energy \"templates\" are then used for recognition.

Sources of variability include individual appearance, 3D pose, facial expression and lighting. We describe a compact parametrised model of facial appearance which takes into account all these sources of variability. The model represents both shape and grey-level appearance and is created by performing a statistical analysis over a training set of face images. A robust multi-resolution search algorithm is used to fit the model to faces in new images. This allows the main facial features to be located and a set of shape and grey-level appearance parameters to be recovered. A good approximation to a given face can be reconstructed using less than 100 of these parameters. This representation can be used for tasks such as image coding, person identification, pose recovery, gender recognition and expression recognition. The system performs well on all the tasks listed above.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1995.466919","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel2/3245/9796/00466919.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1995.466919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9796","startPage":"368","endPage":"373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A unified approach to coding and interpreting face images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=466919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A unified approach to coding and interpreting face images","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466919/","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 1995","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5028035","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified approach to coding and interpreting face images","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00466919.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039522S","chronDate":"20-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"9796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3245","citationCount":"88","articleId":"466919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":466925,"authors":[{"name":"B.

A deformable region model is presented: its optimisation is based on texture correlation and is constrained by the use of a motion model, such as rigid, affine or homographic. The use of texture information (versus edge information) noticeably improves the tracking performances of deformable models in the presence of texture. Then the region contour is refined using an edge based deformable model in order to better deal with specularities, non planar objects and occlusions. The method is illustrated and validated by experimental results on real images.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Region tracking through image sequences","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1995.466925","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel2/3245/9796/00466925.pdf","startPage":"302","endPage":"307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1995.466925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9796","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=466925","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/466925/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Region tracking through image sequences","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5028026","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Region tracking through image sequences","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00466925.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026927S","chronDate":"20-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"9796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3245","citationCount":"63","articleId":"466925","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":466957,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Unfortunately, even order of magnitude measures of failure rate are not truly available for commercial software which is widely distributed. Given repeated reports on the criticality of software, and its significance, the industry flounders for some real baselines. The paper reports the failure rate of a several million line of code commercial software product distributed to hundreds of thousands of customers. To first order of approximation, the MTBF reaches around 4 years and 2 years for successive releases of the software. The changes in the failure rate as a function of severity, release and time are also provided. The measurement technique develops a direct link between failures and faults, providing an opportunity to study and describe the failure process. Two metrics, the fault weight, corresponding to the number of failures due to a fault and failure window, measuring the length of time between the first and last fault, are defined and characterized. The two metrics are found to be higher for higher severity faults, consistently across all severities and releases. At the same time the window to weight ratio, is invariant by severity. The fault weight and failure window are natural measures and are intuitive about the failure process. The fault weight measures the impact of a fault on the overall failure rate and the failure window the dispersion of that impact over time. These two do provide a new forum for discussion and opportunity to gain greater understanding of the processes involved.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/FTCS.1995.466957","startPage":"424","endPage":"433","displayPublicationTitle":"Twenty-Fifth International Symposium on Fault-Tolerant Computing.

In a client-server type of application where the server is intended to ran perpetually for providing a service to its clients, rejuvenating the server process periodically during the most idle time of the server increases the availability of that service. In a long-running computation-intensive application, rejuvenating the application periodically and restarting it at a previous checkpoint increases the likelihood of successfully completing the application execution. We present a model for analyzing software rejuvenation in such continuously-running applications and express downtime and costs due to downtime during rejuvenation in terms of the parameters in that model. Threshold conditions for rejuvenation to be beneficial are also derived. We implemented a reusable module to perform software rejuvenation. That module can be embedded in any existing application on a UNIX platform with minimal effort. Experiences with software rejuvenation in a billing data collection subsystem of a telecommunications operations system and other continuously-running systems and scientific applications in AT&T are described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/FTCS.1995.466961","publicationTitle":"Twenty-Fifth International Symposium on Fault-Tolerant Computing.

However, after k faults are reconfigured around, much of the extra links and switches can remain unutilized. We show how to use the node-covering principle of Dutt and Hayes (1992) and error correcting codes in order to construct probabilistic designs with very high average fault tolerance but low wiring and switch overhead. This design methodology is applicable to any multiprocessor interconnection topology.

In the method, the objective function is the minimum norm contact force. Friction constraints, force constraints and joint torque constraints are considered. The ANN used for this research is based on the functional link (FL) network without hidden layers. The ANN can be trained by an example. 121 samples across the usable input space are included in the training set.

In this system, visual data from the camera are directly used in the servo control process of the manipulator, without calculations of the inverse kinematics. This approach is achieved by the use of an artificial neural network (ANN) to learn the relationship between the position and the orientation of the manipulator and the joint angles. As there are no pre-stored parameters of the manipulator, the system is adaptable to slight changes in the kinematics of the manipulator or the working environment. Hence, this technique should able to extend the application of robotic technology in some special industrial areas.

Many of the applications developed at the University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory are related to equipment and facilities in nuclear power plants.

It makes little difference whether the component or system is part of a nuclear power plants, a manufacturing plant, or a chemical processing plant. Data are used to train a neural network to model the input-output relationships of the systems involved, and patterns associated with specific modes of behavior or characteristics are identified.

The algorithms for the 2D wavelet transform can also be viewed as subband filter banks. The authors propose a block data flow architecture (BDFA) for the 2D product separable filter which is used for the DWT. The BDFA uses block data processing and the block data flow paradigm to minimize system management overhead due to the communication protocol. The authors propose a 2D array structured BDFA which is an extended architecture of the BDFA for the 2D filter. The approach uses both data partitioning and algorithm partitioning to achieve high efficiency and high throughput. The authors compare their approach to existing approaches such as the systolic implementation of the wavelet transform. The proposed method is suitable for real time image processing in the sense that it achieves high throughput and high efficiency using a small number of processors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block data flow implementation of the 2-D discrete wavelet transform","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE-SP International Symposium on Time- Frequency and Time-Scale Analysis","doi":"10.1109/TFSA.1994.467235","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE-SP International Symposium on Time- Frequency and Time-Scale Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel2/3248/9799/00467235.pdf","startPage":"294","endPage":"297","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFSA.1994.467235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=467235","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/467235/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Block data flow implementation of the 2-D discrete wavelet transform","conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5031803","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block data flow implementation of the 2-D discrete wavelet transform","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00467235.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041916S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct 1994","isNumber":"9799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3248","citationCount":"2","articleId":"467235","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":467238,"authors":[{"name":"Weizhong Chen","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Weizhong Chen","id":"37384000000"},{"name":"N.C.

The new recursive procedure is more efficient than that of the third-order real-pole window and requires about 41% of the computation required by a recursive Hamming or Hanning window. The half-sine wave window is finite, absolutely symmetric, and has negligibly small sidelobes in the frequency domain. It is shown that this half-sine wave window is better for real-time processing than a Hamming or a Hanning window due to its better utilization of signal energy. It is also indicated that the new recursive procedure operates equally well for adaptive estimation of average-based features such as lattice filter coefficients. In this case, by using the recursive half-sine wave window, only one real-multiplication operation is needed in one step of updating.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient recursive time-varying Fourier transform by using a half-sine wave window","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE-SP International Symposium on Time- Frequency and Time-Scale Analysis","doi":"10.1109/TFSA.1994.467238","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE-SP International Symposium on Time- Frequency and Time-Scale Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel2/3248/9799/00467238.pdf","startPage":"284","endPage":"286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFSA.1994.467238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=467238","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/467238/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"An efficient recursive time-varying Fourier transform by using a half-sine wave window","conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5031800","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient recursive time-varying Fourier transform by using a half-sine wave window","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00467238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048432S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct 1994","isNumber":"9799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3248","citationCount":"2","articleId":"467238","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":467247,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Good seizure detection schemes facilitate diagnosis of epilepsy and enhance the management of long-term EEG records. The authors investigate a new automated method based on the discrete wavelet decomposition technique for detecting ictal events independent of their EEG morphology. The average power spectrum of EEG of a resting, healthy subject follows a power law attenuation over a range of clinically relevant frequencies suggesting an underlying scale-invariant property. A multi-scale analysis tool is used to monitor this statistical scale-invariance and detect the onset of seizure marked by an appreciable change in this scaling behavior. The detection scheme is based on monitoring the variance structure of the wavelet coefficients over a selected scale range and power fluctuations in these scales individually. Thus, the authors provide a new criteria for the development of an efficient seizure detection scheme.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFSA.1994.467284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9799","startPage":"584","endPage":"587","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE-SP International Symposium on Time- Frequency and Time-Scale Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel2/3248/9799/00467284.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet analysis as a potential tool for seizure detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/467284/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet analysis as a potential tool for seizure detection","conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 1994","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5027006","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet analysis as a potential tool for seizure detection","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00467284.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039869S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct 1994","isNumber":"9799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3248","citationCount":"5","articleId":"467284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":467288,"authors":[{"name":"L.

A final algorithm analyzes the transform results and labels the locations of the dicrotic notch points as well as the systolic peaks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TFSA.1994.467288","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE-SP International Symposium on Time- Frequency and Time-Scale Analysis","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE-SP International Symposium on Time- Frequency and Time-Scale Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel2/3248/9799/00467288.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFSA.1994.467288","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9799","startPage":"568","endPage":"571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet transform analysis of the arterial pressure waveform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=467288","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet transform analysis of the arterial pressure waveform","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/467288/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5027002","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet transform analysis of the arterial pressure waveform","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00467288.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0499S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct 1994","isNumber":"9799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3248","citationCount":"2","articleId":"467288","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":467290,"authors":[{"name":"T.

As quadratic signal representations, they are promising for situations in which the optimal detector is a quadratic function of the observations. All existing time-frequency formulations of quadratic detection either implement classical optimal detectors equivalently in the time-frequency domain, without fully exploiting the structure of the TFR, or attempt to exploit the nonstationary structure of the signal in an ad hoc manner. We identify several important nonstationary quadratic detection scenarios which are \"naturally\" suited for TFR/TSR-based detectors; that is, in which TFR/TSR-based detectors are both optimal and exploit the many degrees of freedom available in the TFR/TSR. We also derive explicit expressions for the corresponding optimal TFR/TSR kernels. The proposed TFR/TSR detectors are directly applicable to many important radar/sonar detection problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFSA.1994.467335","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE-SP International Symposium on Time- Frequency and Time-Scale Analysis","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE-SP International Symposium on Time- Frequency and Time-Scale Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel2/3248/9799/00467335.pdf","startPage":"365","endPage":"368","doi":"10.1109/TFSA.1994.467335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal quadratic detection using bilinear time-frequency and time-scale representations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Optimal quadratic detection using bilinear time-frequency and time-scale representations","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 1994","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5026955","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/467335/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal quadratic detection using bilinear time-frequency and time-scale representations","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00467335.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033829S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct 1994","isNumber":"9799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3248","citationCount":"7","articleId":"467335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":467351,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The approach is a generalization of psuedo QMF designs to nonuniform channel arrangements and the essential idea is to form nonuniform filter banks from uniform sections joined by 'transition' filters. All channel filters are formed by modulating lowpass prototypes. The approach provides a computationally simple method for designing filter banks with large numbers of channels because of the fact that channel filters are modulated from a few lowpass prototypes and because the lowpass prototype designs can be scaled. The technique can be used to produce integer decimation factor designs directly and excellent rational decimation factor designs by combining channel outputs using an inverse polyphase transform.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFSA.1994.467351","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE-SP International Symposium on Time- Frequency and Time-Scale Analysis","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE-SP International Symposium on Time- Frequency and Time-Scale Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel2/3248/9799/00467351.pdf","startPage":"112","endPage":"115","doi":"10.1109/TFSA.1994.467351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The design of nonuniform modulated filter banks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"The design of nonuniform modulated filter banks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 1994","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5026939","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/467351/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The design of nonuniform modulated filter banks","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00467351.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059365S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct 1994","isNumber":"9799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3248","citationCount":"10","articleId":"467351","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":467355,"authors":[{"name":"W.J.

Using simple rules, it is possible to define kernels which guarantee the RID properties. A primitive h(t) is the starting point for kernel design. Starting with this primitive h(t), one may evolve a RID which enjoys all of the desirable properties. In addition, RIDs designed by this means also exhibit scale invariance in addition to the time-shift invariance and frequency-shift invariance exhibited by members of Cohen's class relevant to these properties. Such RIDs also exhibit a property which we call information invariance. Information invariance is defined under Renyi's generalized information. Renyi information has been found to be a useful quantifier of resolution in TFDs wherein minimum values of Renyi information are related to maximum resolution of the signal components. In this paper, we show that h(t) may be adapted to minimize Renyi information and thus achieve very good time-frequency resolution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/467355/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5026935","conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 1994","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive RID kernels which minimize time-frequency uncertainty","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive RID kernels which minimize time-frequency uncertainty","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00467355.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02907S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct 1994","isNumber":"9799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3248","citationCount":"30","articleId":"467355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":467639,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The high-gain spot beams with low sidelobe levels and efficient adjacent beam overlap are generated by employing an offset parabolic reflector with overlapping feed clusters. The beam shape can be adapted to cancel either single- or multiple-jammers by varying excitations within the feed cluster corresponding to the beam. Development of antenna components including Potter horn, polarizer, phase-amplitude controller, and beamforming network is discussed. Measured results of the demonstration antenna have shown that sidelobe and crosspolar levels of better than -25 dB are achieved for beams scanned over an eight-degree diameter circular coverage region. The adapted patterns of the antenna agree well with the computations, and null depths of better than 30 dB have been realized over a 4.5% bandwidth.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.467639","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/9842/00467639.pdf","startPage":"1036","endPage":"1047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.467639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9842","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a 45 GHz multiple-beam antenna for military satellite communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=467639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/467639/","displayDocTitle":"Development of a 45 GHz multiple-beam antenna for military satellite communications","volume":"43","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5089665","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a 45 GHz multiple-beam antenna for military satellite communications","sourcePdf":"00467639.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055637S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"29","articleId":"467639","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":467641,"authors":[{"name":"L.C.

In addition to determining downrange distance, energy, and polarization, the GTD-based model extracts frequency dependent scattering information, allowing partial identification of scattering center geometry. We derive expressions for the Cramer-Rao bound of this model; using these expressions, we analyze the behavior of the new model as a function of scatterer separation, bandwidth, number of data points, and noise level.

The major implication is that an appropriate set of metrons should be selected for each geometry and excitation in question. An argument, however, can be raised against these findings. One can claim that the MEI is indeed invariant, and that any discrepancies are entirely due to the mesh discretization error. The authors disprove this claim by a counterexample. They perform an analytical study of the MEI as applied to a perfectly conducting circular cylinder with a fixed choice of metrons. They then investigate the behavior of the MEI when the electrical radius of the cylinder becomes large and when the nodal separation goes to zero. They prove that even as the MEI residual goes to zero the error in the MEI solution remains finite and cannot be reduced below a certain limit.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analytical characterization of the error in the measured equation of invariance","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.467647","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/9842/00467647.pdf","startPage":"1109","endPage":"1115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.467647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9842","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=467647","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/467647/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"An analytical characterization of the error in the measured equation of invariance","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5089673","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analytical characterization of the error in the measured equation of invariance","sourcePdf":"00467647.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044815S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"18","articleId":"467647","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":467650,"authors":[{"name":"Jian-Ming Jin","affiliation":["Electromagnetics Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Jian-Ming Jin","id":"37280854400"},{"name":"S.S.

A coupling scheme is then developed to combine these two methods in such a manner that (i) it includes all significant interactions and (ii) it permits the SBR and FEM to be computed separately.

The main utility of these integrals is that they can be used to quantify the fundamental limitations in feedback design which arise due to system characteristics such as open-loop unstable poles and nonminimum phase zeros and to such fundamental design requirements as stability and bandwidth constraints. We present extensions to both the classical Bode sensitivity integral relation and Poisson integral formula. These extended integral relations exhibit important insights toward trade-offs that must be performed between sensitivity reduction and sensitivity increase due to the aforementioned system characteristics and design constraints. Most importantly, these results display new phenomena concerning design limitations in multivariable systems which have no analog in single-input single-output systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/9843/00467680.pdf","startPage":"1700","endPage":"1716","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/9.467680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.467680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9843","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=467680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensitivity integral relations and design trade-offs in linear multivariable feedback systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Robust stability","Poles and zeros","Frequency","Bandwidth","MIMO","Transfer functions","Design methodology","Displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear systems","multivariable control systems","closed loop systems","poles and zeros","stability","sensitivity analysis","control system synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop transfer function","linear multivariable feedback systems","singular values","feedback design","open-loop unstable poles","nonminimum phase zeros","stability","bandwidth constraints","Bode sensitivity integral relation","Poisson integral formula"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/467680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity integral relations and design trade-offs in linear multivariable feedback systems","volume":"40","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5082709","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity integral relations and design trade-offs in linear multivariable feedback systems","sourcePdf":"00467680.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038528S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"96","articleId":"467680","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":467692,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanyuan Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT, USA"],"lastName":"Yuanyuan Yang","id":"37280588900"},{"name":"G.M.

These ring sandwich networks are rearrangeable in the sense that a request for a connection between a sender and a receiver can sometimes be realized only by first rearranging other existing connection paths through the network. We present analytical results which permit the average rearrangeability of ring sandwich networks to be evaluated on the basis of fundamental structural parameters associated with the ring sandwich design so that the trade-off between the network rearrangeability and the network cost can be determined. It is shown that the average number of rearrangements to satisfy a broadcast connection request relative to the subnetwork of the cascaded ring sandwich structure providing fanout can be reduced to O(1); this is in contrast to O(N) for other existing cascaded designs. We give detailed connecting algorithms that can be used to satisfy connection requests. We also support our analytically derived results with corroborating simulation data.

A system failure often causes changes in critical system parameters, or even, changes in the nonlinear dynamics of the system. This paper presents a general framework for constructing automated fault diagnosis and accommodation architectures using on-line approximators and adaptation/learning schemes. In this framework, neural network models constitute an important class of on-line approximators. Changes in the system dynamics are monitored by an on-line approximation model, which is used not only for detecting but also for accommodating failures. A systematic procedure for constructing nonlinear estimation algorithms is developed, and a stable learning scheme is derived using Lyapunov theory. Simulation studies are used to illustrate the results and to gain intuition into the selection of design parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.467710","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/9845/00467710.pdf","startPage":"1447","endPage":"1458","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.467710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9845","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated fault detection and accommodation: a learning systems approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=467710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/467710/","displayDocTitle":"Automated fault detection and accommodation: a learning systems approach","volume":"25","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","accessionNumber":"5102874","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated fault detection and accommodation: a learning systems approach","sourcePdf":"00467710.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127476S","chronDate":"Nov 1995","isNumber":"9845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"245","articleId":"467710","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":467743,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The PS-PMT has ten stages of metal channel dynodes and crossed-wire anodes in a 28 mm square/spl times/20 mm high metal package. The performance of the PS-PMT and the block detector was evaluated in terms of applicability to PET. The coincidence timing resolution was 4.4 ns FWHM and 9.5 ns FWTM, and the energy resolution was about 30% for 511 keV /spl gamma/-rays, with the PS-PMTs coupled to single BGO segments. The spatial resolution of the block detector was evaluated by measuring the detector response functions (DRFs) for each BGO segment. The average FWHM values of the DRFs were 3.0 mm in the X direction, and 6.8 mm in the Y direction. Count rate performance of the block detector was measured at different activity levels, when no distinct mispositioning in crystal coding was seen at count rates up to 100 kcps. A compact SD-PET system dedicated to animal studies was designed by adopting the position-sensitive detectors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compact position-sensitive detector for PET","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.467743","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/9846/00467743.pdf","startPage":"1090","endPage":"1094","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.467743","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9846","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=467743","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/467743/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1995","displayDocTitle":"A compact position-sensitive detector for PET","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5047073","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compact position-sensitive detector for PET","sourcePdf":"00467743.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037177S","chronDate":"Aug.  1995","isNumber":"9846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"37","articleId":"467743","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":467744,"authors":[{"name":"W.W.

The energy resolution averages 20% for the HR PLUS block and 23% for the HR block, with efficiency variations of 17% in both blocks. Additional measurements were carried out on the HR PLUS block to characterize depth of interaction effects and cross-talk between elements.

The detector consists of a 2-D array of small bismuth germanate (BGO) crystals coupled via optical fibers to a multi-channel photomultiplier tube (MC-PMT). Though this approach offers several advantages over the conventional BGO block design, it does require that a sufficient number of scintillation photons be transported from the crystal, down the fiber and into the PMT. In this study we use simulations and experimental data to determine how to maximize the signal reaching the PMT. This involves investigating factors such as crystal geometry, crystal surface treatment, the use of reflectors, choice of optical fiber, coupling of crystal to the optical fiber and optical fiber properties. Our results indicate that using 2/spl times/2/spl times/10 mm BGO crystals coupled to 30 cm of clad optical fiber, roughly 50 photoelectrons are produced at the PMT photocathode for a 511 keV interaction. This is sufficient to clearly visualize the photopeak and provide adequate timing resolution for PET. Based on these encouraging results, a prototype detector will now be constructed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/9846/00467749.pdf","startPage":"1058","endPage":"1063","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.467749","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.467749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9846","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=467749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Collection of scintillation light from small BGO crystals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fibers","Photonic crystal fibers","Positron emission tomography","Optical coupling","Solid scintillation detectors","Optical arrays","Image resolution","Animals","High-resolution imaging","Optical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bismuth compounds","solid scintillation detectors","positron emission tomography","photomultipliers","optical fibre couplers","photocathodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scintillation light collection","small BGO crystals","high resolution positron emission tomography","PET detector","animal imaging","2D array","optical fibers coupling","multichannel photomultiplier tube","crystal geometry","crystal surface treatment","reflectors","optical fiber properties","PMT photocathode","timing resolution","prototype detector","10 mm","511 keV","30 cm","2 mm","Bi/sub 4/Ge/sub 3/O/sub 12/"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/467749/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Collection of scintillation light from small BGO crystals","volume":"42","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5047067","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collection of scintillation light from small BGO crystals","sourcePdf":"00467749.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068448S","chronDate":"Aug.  1995","isNumber":"9846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"76","articleId":"467749","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":467751,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Light yields of 4200/spl plusmn/200 phe/MeV and 18500/spl plusmn/900 e-h pair/MeV were measured for the PM tube and the photodiode, respectively. The light pulse shape exhibits a pure exponential decay with a time constant of 47.2/spl plusmn/1.3 ns for both /spl gamma/-rays and /spl alpha/-particles. Energy resolutions of 10% and 14.6% for the 662 keV /spl gamma/-rays from a /sup 137/Cs source were obtained for the photomultiplier and the photodiode readout, respectively. A time resolution of 180 ns was observed for /sup 60/Co /spl gamma/-rays at 1 MeV threshold and 400 ps for 100 keV threshold. The study confirmed a number of advantages of the LSO scintillator for nuclear physics experiments, however, for small size samples. For larger volumes the natural radioactivity of the LSO, about 300 counts/s/cm/sup 3/, may limit possible applications.

Although the software was designed for a GE Advance scanner, it is easily adaptable to other 3D scanners. The reconstruction software was written for an Intel iPSC/860 parallel computer with 128 compute nodes. Running on 32 processors, the algorithm requires approximately 55 minutes per iteration to reconstruct a 128/spl times/128/spl times/35 image. No projection data compression schemes or other approximations were used in the implementation. Extensive use of EM system matrix (C/sub ij/) symmetries (including the 8-fold in-plane symmetries, 2-fold axial symmetries, and axial parallel line redundancies) reduces the storage cost by a factor of 188. The parallel algorithm operates on distributed projection data which are decomposed by base-symmetry angles. Symmetry operators copy and index the C/sub ij/ chord to the form required for the particular symmetry. The use of asynchronous reads, lookup tables, and optimized image indexing improves computational performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A system for the 3D reconstruction of retracted-septa PET data using the EM algorithm","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.467875","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/9846/00467875.pdf","startPage":"1223","endPage":"1227","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.467875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9846","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=467875","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/467875/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1995","displayDocTitle":"A system for the 3D reconstruction of retracted-septa PET data using the EM algorithm","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5053454","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A system for the 3D reconstruction of retracted-septa PET data using the EM algorithm","sourcePdf":"00467875.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115582S","chronDate":"Aug.  1995","isNumber":"9846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"77","articleId":"467875","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":467881,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

In the first application, an ANN assigns quality coefficients to alpha particle energy spectra. These spectra are used to detect plutonium contamination in the work environment. The quality coefficients represent the levels of spectral degradation caused by miscalibration and foreign matter affecting the instruments. A set of spectra was labeled with quality coefficients by an expert and used to train the ANN expert system. Our investigation shows that the expert knowledge of spectral quality can be transferred to an ANN system. The second application combines a portable gamma-ray spectrometer with an ANN to automatically identify radioactive isotopes in real-time. Two neural network paradigms are examined and compared: the linear perceptron and the optimal linear associative memory (OLAM). Both networks have a linear response and are useful in determining the composition of an unknown sample when the spectrum of the unknown is a linear superposition of known spectra. One feature of this technique is that it uses the whole spectrum in the identification process instead of only the individual photo-peaks. This approach has been successfully tested with data generated by Monte Carlo simulations and with field data from both sodium iodide and germanium detectors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/467888/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5053440","volume":"42","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Nuclear spectral analysis via artificial neural networks for waste handling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nuclear spectral analysis via artificial neural networks for waste handling","sourcePdf":"00467888.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080259S","chronDate":"Aug.  1995","isNumber":"9846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"25","articleId":"467888","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":467893,"authors":[{"name":"V.T.

The optimum receiver is well known, but is too difficult to implement. Hence, two suboptimal receivers are considered: the \"biquadratic\" receiver, optimum at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR's), and the \"bilinear\" receiver (optimum at high SNR's) which is also a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) receiver for this case. We analyze the performances of the two suboptimal receivers over two-path channels and compare them to the basic quadratic receiver. For this purpose we present a general method for computing the error probability that can be applied to any dual-diversity binary detection problem whenever the method of characteristic functions fails. We present the exact analytical expressions for the biquadratic receiver, and the numerically computed results for the GLRT receiver, in terms of the conditional, average and asymptotic error probabilities. It is shown that the two receivers are rather close in performance in most of the SNR ranges of interest.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.467955","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.467955","startPage":"715","endPage":"728","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/9848/00467955.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9848","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of the noncoherent biquadratic and GLRT receivers over two-path channels with known amplitudes and Rayleigh fading","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1995","displayDocTitle":"Performance of the noncoherent biquadratic and GLRT receivers over two-path channels with known amplitudes and Rayleigh fading","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"44","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5096254","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/467955/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of the noncoherent biquadratic and GLRT receivers over two-path channels with known amplitudes and Rayleigh fading","sourcePdf":"00467955.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039966S","chronDate":"Nov 1995","isNumber":"9848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"3","articleId":"467955","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":467956,"authors":[{"name":"D.K.

Source-matched binary Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codecs combined with unequal protection diversity- and pilot-assisted 16and 64-level quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM, 64-QAM) are employed in order to accommodate both the 4.7 and the 6.5 kbits/s coded speech bits at a signaling rate of 3.1 kBd. Assuming an excess bandwidth of 100%, in a bandwidth of 200 kHz 32 time slots can be created, which allows us to support in excess of 50 users, when employing packet reservation multiple access (PRMA). Good communications quality speech is delivered in an equivalent bandwidth of 4 kHz, if the channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of the benign indoors cordless channel are in excess of about 15 and 25 dB for the lower and higher speech quality 16-QAM and 64-QAM systems, respectively, and the PRMA time-slots are sufficiently uninterfered due to using time-slot classification algorithms and due to the attenuation of partitioning walls and ceilings.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.467957","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/9848/00467957.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.467957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9848","startPage":"735","endPage":"748","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An intelligent multimode voice communications system for indoor communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=467957","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An intelligent multimode voice communications system for indoor communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/467957/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","accessionNumber":"5096256","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An intelligent multimode voice communications system for indoor communications","sourcePdf":"00467957.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053059S","chronDate":"Nov 1995","isNumber":"9848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"16","articleId":"467957","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":467958,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The proposed technique features a combined narrow/wide band dual open loop (DOL) carrier phase estimator, which effectively enables the coherent receiver to track fast phase fluctuations caused by fading, without degradation in phase slip characteristics. Additionally, an open loop phase estimator has inherent quick recovery performance. Its bit error rate (BER) performance is shown to be superior to that for existing detection schemes, achieving a 10/sup -2/ BER at 6.3 dB E/sub b//N/sub 0/ (0.9 dB greater than the theoretical E/sub b//N/sub 0/ condition for perfect carrier phase tracking) for QPSK over a Rician fading channel with the 10 dB Rician factor and the 1/16 baud rate fading pitch. The paper also describes a quick bit timing recovery scheme, with interpolation, featuring an open loop structure.

A modular approach was used to couple in a self-consistent manner the disparate time scales of plasma and neutral species transport. This way, complex plasma chemical reactions (involving electrons, ions and neutrals) as well as surface chemistry can be included in the simulation, The power deposited into the plasma was calculated by an electromagnetics module which solves Maxwell's equations. The power deposition was used in the electron energy module to find the electron temperature and the rate coefficients of electron-impact reactions. These were in turn used as source terms in separate neutral and charged species transport modules. By iterating among the modules, a self-consistent solution was obtained. Quantities of interest, such as power deposition, species density and flux, and etch rate and uniformity were thus calculated, As power deposition was increased, the electron density increased linearly, the plasma became less electronegative, the degree of gas dissociation increased, and the plasma potential remained constant. The radial uniformity of the Cl atom flux was better than that of the ion flux. The reactivity of the wafer as compared to that of the surrounding electrode surface significantly affected the etch uniformity, despite the low pressure of 10 mtorr.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/27.467977","startPage":"573","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/27/9849/00467977.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/27.467977","endPage":"580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9849","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-dimensional simulation of polysilicon etching with chlorine in a high density plasma reactor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/467977/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"Two-dimensional simulation of polysilicon etching with chlorine in a high density plasma reactor","volume":"23","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5089773","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-dimensional simulation of polysilicon etching with chlorine in a high density plasma reactor","sourcePdf":"00467977.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04643S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"60","articleId":"467977","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":467980,"authors":[{"name":"V.P.

The electromagnetic fields and the plasma dynamics are solved in a self-consistent manner. A compact ECR (electron cyclotron resonance) plasma source used for the generation of ions for materials processing is simulated. This source has a plasma size of 3.6 cm in diameter and 3 cm in height. Simulation results of microwave power absorption, plasma potential, and microwave electric fields are presented. Distributed computing techniques are explored to handle the large computer memory requirements and the long computer simulation times associated with the three-dimensional particle-in-cell plasma model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/27.467980","pdfPath":"/iel1/27/9849/00467980.pdf","startPage":"602","endPage":"608","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/27.467980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9849","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-dimensional electromagnetic PIC model of a compact ECR plasma source","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/467980/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"Three-dimensional electromagnetic PIC model of a compact ECR plasma source","volume":"23","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5089776","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-dimensional electromagnetic PIC model of a compact ECR plasma source","sourcePdf":"00467980.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033584S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"15","articleId":"467980","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":467998,"authors":[{"name":"B.F.

Then, the base-band is interframe encoded using a simple 3-D block-matching method and LADVQ search algorithm. This band is used to decide the codebooks and the blocks sizes for encoding the high frequency bands. To reduce the complexity, the high-bands are encoded using the LAVQ. The simulation results show that good quality pictures can be obtained at a bit rate as low as 0.290 bpp (about 15 Mbits/sec). This rate will facilitate the transmission of three HDTV channels via a DS3 rated 45 Mbits/sec channel. This algorithm is tested on digital video sequences.

It has been shown that at certain frequencies the acoustic backscatter from elastic targets exhibits certain resonance behavior which closely relates to the physical properties of the target such as dimension, thickness, and composition. Several techniques in both the time domain and frequency domain have been developed to characterize the resonance phenomena in acoustic backscatter from spherical or cylindrical thin shells. The purpose of this paper is to develop an automated approach for identifying the presence of resonance in the acoustic backscatter from an unknown target by isolating the resonance part from the specular contribution. An adaptive transversal filter structure is used to estimate the specular part of the backscatter and consequently the error signal would provide an estimate of the resonance part. An important aspect of this scheme Lies in the fact that it does not require an underlying model for the elastic return. The adaptation rule is based upon fast Recursive Least Squares (RLS) learning. The approach taken in this paper is general in the sense that it can be applied to targets of unknown geometry and thickness and, further, does not require any a priori information about the target and/or the environment. Test results on acoustic data are presented which indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Further, we demonstrate, for the first time, that the anomalous subthreshold slope, that exists in a DC static transfer I-V curve, does not exist in fast transient mode because the minimum time constant for body charging by impact ionization current is on the order of 3 ns in such devices.","doi":"10.1109/55.468279","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel1/55/9854/00468279.pdf","startPage":"497","endPage":"499","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/55.468279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9854","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the transient operation of partially depleted SOI NMOSFET's","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=468279","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/468279/","displayDocTitle":"On the transient operation of partially depleted SOI NMOSFET's","volume":"16","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","accessionNumber":"5109348","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the transient operation of partially depleted SOI NMOSFET's","sourcePdf":"00468279.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028681S","chronDate":"Nov.  1995","isNumber":"9854","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"22","articleId":"468279","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":468280,"authors":[{"name":"C.-Y.

Minimizing the cost of the distribution system can be a considerable challenge, as the feeder system associated with only a single substation may present a distribution designer with thousands of feasible design options from which to choose. Finding the overall least-cost plan for the distribution system associated with several neighboring substations can be a truly daunting task. For these reasons, the use of computer-aided tools that help identify the lowest cost distribution configuration has been a focus of much R&D work in the last 3 decades, producing a number of computerized optimization programs that can be viewed from the user's standpoint as tools to help find the best design from among those many possibilities.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/67.468295","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Applications in Power","startPage":"12","endPage":"17","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Applications in Power","pdfPath":"/iel3/67/9855/00468295.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/67.468295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9855","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization applications to power distribution","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power distribution","Conductors","Cost function","Design optimization","Substations","Guidelines","Distributed computing","Home computing","Marketing and sales","Power generation economics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","power system planning","power system analysis computing","optimisation","power system CAD","substations","economics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric utility","power distribution system","optimization","applications","feeder system","substation","design options","least-cost plan","computer-aided tools","distribution configuration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"Optimization applications to power distribution","volume":"8","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5090866","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/468295/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization applications to power distribution","sourcePdf":"00468295.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041878S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"67","citationCount":"46","articleId":"468295","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":468362,"authors":[{"name":"G.J.

They perform comparisons of interference averaging and avoidance multiple access strategies for cellular systems, with capacity as a function of minimum acceptable signal to interference ratio. They discuss some interference suppression methods. Multiple base stations are presented as a means of further increasing capacity. Throughout all of the above, the discussion is centered on connection-oriented traffic such as voice and video, with communication mediated by a network of base stations.

It is, therefore, apparent that this unique device offers greater flexibility than previously available sources, and will enable many new and novel experiments in many areas of science and technology.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/2944.468374","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/2944/9857/00468374.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2944.468374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9857","startPage":"31","endPage":"43","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization and applications of high repetition rate, broadly tunable, femtosecond optical parametric oscillators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=468374","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Characterization and applications of high repetition rate, broadly tunable, femtosecond optical parametric oscillators","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/468374/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"1","publicationDate":"April 1995","accessionNumber":"4941678","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization and applications of high repetition rate, broadly tunable, femtosecond optical parametric oscillators","sourcePdf":"00468374.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072618S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"9857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"6","articleId":"468374","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":468377,"authors":[{"name":"H.M.

The simplicity of the level structure provides freedom from unwanted processes such as excited state absorption, multiphonon nonradiative decay, and concentration quenching. These fiber lasers therefore offer a very efficient and convenient means of wavelength conversion from a wide variety of pump lasers, including AlGaAs and InGaAs diodes and Nd:YAG lasers. Efficient operation with narrow linewidth at any wavelength in the emission range can be conveniently achieved using fiber gratings. A wide range of application for these sources can be anticipated. In this paper, the capabilities of this versatile source are reviewed. Analytical procedures and numerical data are presented to enable design choices to be made for the wide range of operating conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/2944.468377","startPage":"2","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/2944/9857/00468377.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2944.468377","endPage":"13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9857","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ytterbium-doped silica fiber lasers: versatile sources for the 1-1.2 /spl mu/m region","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/468377/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","displayDocTitle":"Ytterbium-doped silica fiber lasers: versatile sources for the 1-1.2 /spl mu/m region","volume":"1","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4941675","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ytterbium-doped silica fiber lasers: versatile sources for the 1-1.2 /spl mu/m region","sourcePdf":"00468377.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060631S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"9857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"370","articleId":"468377","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":468387,"authors":[{"name":"P.

We propose an architectural approach to global illumination. The proposed rendering architecture Vision is derived from a model of the physical rendering process, which is subsequently mapped onto an object-oriented hierarchy of classes. This design is powerful and flexible enough to support and exploit a large body of existing illumination algorithms for the simulation of various aspects of the underlying physical model. Additionally, the Vision architecture offers a platform for developing new algorithms and for combining them to create new rendering solutions. We discuss both abstract design as well as implementation issues. In particular, we give a detailed description of the global lighting subsystem and show how algorithms for path tracing, bidirectional estimators, irradiance caching, hierarchical radiosity, wavelet radiosity, and wavelet radiance have been implemented within Vision.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/2945.468387","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","startPage":"77","endPage":"96","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel1/2945/9858/00468387.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2945.468387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vision-an architecture for global illumination calculations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lighting","Layout","Object oriented modeling","Computer architecture","Rendering (computer graphics)","Differential equations","Integral equations","Computer graphics","Algorithm design and analysis","Image generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lighting","rendering (computer graphics)","object-oriented methods","digital simulation","ray tracing","brightness","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global illumination calculations","Vision architecture","rendering architecture","physical rendering process","object-oriented class hierarchy","illumination algorithms","simulation","abstract design","implementation issues","global lighting subsystem","path tracing","bidirectional estimators","irradiance caching","hierarchical radiosity","wavelet radiosity","wavelet radiance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"Vision-an architecture for global illumination calculations","volume":"1","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4919109","publicationDate":"March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/468387/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vision-an architecture for global illumination calculations","sourcePdf":"00468387.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048712S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"9858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"16","articleId":"468387","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":468388,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The variance calculation is based on the assumption that the errors in the estimate are caused by the projections of single polygon edges, and that the positions and orientations of these edges are random. This replaces the infinite dimensional space of possible environments by the two dimensional space of great circles on the unit sphere, making the numerical variance minimization possible.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/2945.468388","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","startPage":"60","endPage":"76","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel1/2945/9858/00468388.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2945.468388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal sampling for hemicubes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Layout","Hardware","Shape","Ray tracing","Lighting","Technological innovation","Testing","Geometry","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphics","brightness","random processes","statistical analysis","error analysis","computational geometry","optimisation","optimal systems","ray tracing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hemicube estimates","form factors","finite sample direction set","optimal arrangements","optimal sampling","optimal sample direction arrangements","pixel shape changing","pixel size changing","hemicube shape changing","nonuniform pixel grids","variance calculation","estimate error","single polygon edges projections","random edge orientations","random edge positions","possible environments","two dimensional space","great circles","unit sphere","numerical variance minimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"Optimal sampling for hemicubes","volume":"1","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4919108","publicationDate":"March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/468388/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal sampling for hemicubes","sourcePdf":"00468388.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047572S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"9858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"3","articleId":"468388","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":468390,"authors":[{"name":"Boon-Lock Yeo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Boon-Lock Yeo","id":"37280588500"},{"name":"Bede Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Bede Liu","id":"37279239500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"468390","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":15,"totalDownloads":407},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Volume rendering of DCT-based compressed 3D scalar data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=468390","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Discrete cosine transforms","Data visualization","Image reconstruction","Discrete transforms","Biomedical imaging","Visual effects","Books","Electronic mail","Image generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rendering (computer graphics)","discrete cosine transforms","data compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["volume rendering","DCT-based compressed 3D scalar data","discrete cosine transform based compression technique","overlapping blocks","local rendering","parallelization","spatial homogeneity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/2945.468390","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel1/2945/9858/00468390.pdf","startPage":"29","endPage":"43","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2945.468390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9858","abstract":"The paper proposes a scheme to perform volume rendering from compressed scalar data. Instead of decompressing the entire data set before rendering, blocks of data are decompressed as needed. Discrete cosine transform based compression technique is used to illustrate the method. The data is partitioned into overlapping blocks to permit local rendering and allow easy parallelization. Compression by factor of 20 to 30 produces rendering virtually indistinguishable from rendering using the original uncompressed data. Speedup is obtained by making use of spatial homogeneity detected in the transform domain. Rendering time using the proposed approach is less than that of direct rendering from the entire uncompressed data. The proposed method thus offers an attractive option to reduce storage, computation, and transmission overhead of otherwise huge data sets.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/468390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","volume":"1","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4919106","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Volume rendering of DCT-based compressed 3D scalar data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Volume rendering of DCT-based compressed 3D scalar data","sourcePdf":"00468390.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057779S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"9858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"67","articleId":"468390","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":468391,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

Fortunately, data on networks is plentiful; by visualizing this data, it is possible to greatly improve our understanding. Our focus is on visualizing the data associated with a network and not on simply visualizing the structure of the network itself. We begin with three static network displays; two of these use geographical relationships, while the third is a matrix arrangement that gives equal emphasis to all network links. Static displays can be swamped with large amounts of data; hence we introduce direct manipulation techniques that permit the graphs to continue to reveal relationships in the context of much more data. In effect, the static displays are parameterized so that interesting views may easily be discovered interactively.

Secondly we introduce a technique to visualize vector magnitude as well as vector direction, i.e., variable-speed flow animation. Thirdly we show how to modify LIC to visualize unsteady (time dependent) flows. Our implementation utilizes texture-mapping hardware to run in real time, which allows our algorithms to be included in interactive applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/2945.468406","startPage":"133","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel1/2945/9859/00468406.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2945.468406","endPage":"141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using line integral convolution for flow visualization: curvilinear grids, variable-speed animation, and unsteady flows","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/468406/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Using line integral convolution for flow visualization: curvilinear grids, variable-speed animation, and unsteady flows","volume":"1","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4988060","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using line integral convolution for flow visualization: curvilinear grids, variable-speed animation, and unsteady flows","sourcePdf":"00468406.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040712S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"9859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"69","articleId":"468406","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":468461,"authors":[{"name":"W.-H.

The active devices in the grid are chips with heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) differential pairs that include a resistive network to provide self-bias to the base. The planar metal grid structure was empirically designed to provide effective coupling between the HBTs and free space. The peak gain of the grid was 10 dB at 10 GHz with a 3 dB bandwidth of 1 GHz. The input and output matches are better than 15 dB at 10 GHz. The maximum output power is 450 mW, and the minimum noise figure is 7 dB. Tests show that the grid is quite tolerant of failures-the output power dropped by only 1 dB when the 10% of the inputs were detuned. The device amplifies beams with incidence angles up to 30/spl deg/ with less than a 3-dB drop in power. By providing external feedback with a twist reflector, the grid amplifier can be used as a broadband tunable source. This source could be tuned from 6.5 GHz to 11.5 GHz with a peak effective radiated power (ERP) of 6.3 W at 9.9 GHz.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9862","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.1993.468469","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference (APMC'93)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference (APMC'93)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3290/9862/00468469.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doi":"10.1109/APMC.1993.468469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance and applications of a 1-element HBT grid amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","displayDocTitle":"Performance and applications of a 1-element HBT grid amplifier","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 1993","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"5043700","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/468469/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance and applications of a 1-element HBT grid amplifier","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00468469.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036602S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"9862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3290","articleId":"468469","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":468896,"authors":[{"name":"T.E.

In both industrialized and developing countries, economic and social progress depends on improved telecommunications. Like other means of transport, telephones, computers, satellites and fiber optic cables and their proper interfaces are essential for moving commercial goods and services. Benefits of satellite communications should in the 1990's be extended to users in all parts of the world through the use of smaller, inexpensive and less sophisticated Earth stations for two way (voice and data), and one way (video, data) use. While earlier satellite systems have been designed and implemented using C and S band communications with satellites in geostationary orbits (GEO), K band communications using VSATs (Very Small Aperture Terminals) have enabled the communications across areas of the US and the world where extensive telecommunications networks did not exist and/or were not affordable. In addition, several systems have been proposed (being built) to provide for the global communication of the mobile users using clusters of smaller, less complex satellites in low Earth orbit (LEG) and medium Earth orbit (MEO). Mobile satellite systems are the future of the satellite communications technology applications. In this presentation, we will briefly summarize the status for satellite communications and then present a comparison of the enabling mobile satellite communications technologies and mobile satellite systems currently being developed. We will also review applications of these systems in public and commercial areas in this presentation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/AERO.1995.468896","publicationTitle":"1995 IEEE Aerospace Applications Conference.

More recently, domain based testing (DBT) was proposed as an alternative method. Automated test data generation decreases test generation time and cost, but we must evaluate its effectiveness. We report on an experiment with a neural network as a classifier to learn about the system under test and to predict the fault exposure capability of newly generated test cases. The network is trained on test case metric input data and fault severity level output parameters. Results show that a neural net can be an effective approach to test case effectiveness prediction. The neural net formalizes and objectively evaluates some of the testing folklore and rules-of-thumb that are system specific and often require many years of testing experience.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/AERO.1995.468919","startPage":"77","endPage":"91 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 IEEE Aerospace Applications Conference.

The soft switching snubber provides zero-voltage switching for the IGBT, thereby reducing the high turn-off losses of the IGBT due to the current tailing. The proposed snubber uses an auxiliary switch to discharge the snubber capacitor. This auxiliary switch also operates at zero-voltage and zero-current switching. The size of the auxiliary switch compared to the main switch makes this snubber a good alternative to the conventional snubber or even to passive low-loss snubbers. The use of the soft switching active snubber permits the IGBT to operate at high frequencies, with low EMI and an improved RBSOA. The use of an active snubber allows recovery of part of the energy stored in the snubber capacitor during the turn-off. Finally, a generic snubber cell is identified for all the nonisolated DC/DC power converters (buck, boost, buck-boost, Cuk, Sepic, Zeta).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.1995.468991","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9884","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - APEC'95","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - APEC'95","pdfPath":"/iel2/3292/9884/00468991.pdf","endPage":"489 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft switching active snubbers for DC/DC converters","doi":"10.1109/APEC.1995.468991","startPage":"483","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=468991","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"Soft switching active snubbers for DC/DC converters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/468991/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5021803","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"5-9 March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft switching active snubbers for DC/DC converters","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00468991.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034951S","chronDate":"5-9 Mar 1995","isNumber":"9884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3292","citationCount":"2","articleId":"468991","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":468995,"authors":[{"name":"M.

However, most resonant DC/DC power converters need frequency control to regulate the output voltage. To alleviate the problem, the thinned-out method can regulate the output voltage at a fixed operating frequency by thinning-out some pulses of the switch voltage. Another advantage of thinned-out method is that it can operate with low noise and simple systems. The purpose of this paper is to propose the application of the thinned-out method to a conventional class E rectifier and improve the low output regulation. Some experimental results are shown as a class E/sup 2/ resonant DC/DC power converter. The measured efficiency /spl mu/ was maintained over 60 percent for varying the output voltage from 3.3 V to 2.3 V. The experimental results were in good agreement with the theoretical values.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resonant DC/DC converter with class E inverter and class E rectifier using thinned-out method","doi":"10.1109/APEC.1995.468995","endPage":"515 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - APEC'95","pdfPath":"/iel2/3292/9884/00468995.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - APEC'95","startPage":"510","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.1995.468995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9884","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=468995","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonance","DC-DC power converters","Inverters","Rectifiers","Diodes","Voltage","Switches","Frequency conversion","Frequency control","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resonant power convertors","DC-DC power convertors","rectifying circuits","invertors","DC-AC power convertors","AC-DC power convertors","voltage control","switching circuits","network analysis","circuit testing","frequency control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resonant DC/DC power converter","class E inverter","class E rectifier","thinned-out method","operating frequency","frequency control","output voltage regulation","efficiency","3.3 to 2.3 V"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Resonant DC/DC converter with class E inverter and class E rectifier using thinned-out method","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/468995/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Mar 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"5-9 March 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5021807","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resonant DC/DC converter with class E inverter and class E rectifier using thinned-out method","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00468995.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031953S","chronDate":"5-9 Mar 1995","isNumber":"9884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3292","citationCount":"8","articleId":"468995","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":469010,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

Dynamic performance has been evaluated as well as the steady state light load, full load, leading, lagging and unity power factor operating conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Utility interface issues for line connected PWM voltage source converters: a comparative study","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - APEC'95","doi":"10.1109/APEC.1995.469010","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - APEC'95","pdfPath":"/iel2/3292/9884/00469010.pdf","startPage":"125","endPage":"132 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.1995.469010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9884","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=469010","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/469010/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"Utility interface issues for line connected PWM voltage source converters: a comparative study","conferenceDate":"5-9 March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5038610","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utility interface issues for line connected PWM voltage source converters: a comparative study","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00469010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026771S","chronDate":"5-9 Mar 1995","isNumber":"9884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3292","citationCount":"37","articleId":"469010","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":469018,"authors":[{"name":"Y.A.

It is desirable to use the overmodulation strategy that can extend the normal operating range even in this case. In this paper, a new overmodulation strategy is proposed for the high performance motor drive and a comparison study with two conventional strategies are also described. In the proposed strategy, considering the motor dynamics, a suitable voltage vector is selected in order to extend the stable operating range in the overmodulation region. With this advanced algorithm, the normal operating range can be extended without any extra hardware. From the experimental results, it is verified that the proposed strategy provided the improved performance over the conventional strategies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - APEC'95","pdfPath":"/iel2/3292/9884/00469022.pdf","startPage":"211","endPage":"216 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - APEC'95","doi":"10.1109/APEC.1995.469022","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.1995.469022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9884","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=469022","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new overmodulation strategy for induction motor drive using space vector PWM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Induction motor drives","Space vector pulse width modulation","Voltage control","Induction motors","Synchronous motors","Control systems","Motor drives","Pulse width modulation inverters","System performance","Stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor drives","PWM invertors","machine control","electric current control","controllers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor drive","space vector PWM inverters","overmodulation strategy","three phase","current controller","motor torque deterioration","motor speed deterioration","high performance motor drive","voltage vector"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/469022/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"A new overmodulation strategy for induction motor drive using space vector PWM","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5038622","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-9 March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new overmodulation strategy for induction motor drive using space vector PWM","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00469022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052511S","chronDate":"5-9 Mar 1995","isNumber":"9884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3292","citationCount":"29","articleId":"469022","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":469023,"authors":[{"name":"Liyong Chen","affiliation":["Polyspede Electronics Corporation, Dallas, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Liyong Chen","id":"37350978500"},{"name":"J.C.

The main purposes of this implementation are (a) to redistribute low-level control decisions to other on-board subsystems in order to better utilize the system computational resources, and (b) to simplify the design of the inverter stage and its associated controller. The use of an ASIC performing the PWM function relieves the DSP from this task allowing for greater system flexibility and increased computation time for more sophisticated control algorithms. The use of power modules offers simpler system design, greater fault tolerance (leading to higher system reliability), and a reduced system footprint due to a compact \"building block\" design hierarchy which reduces part count, mass, and volume. The system architecture and detailed schematics are presented. Experimental results illustrate the feasibility of the proposed ideas when the designed drive is controlling the speed of a 2 HP induction motor using a model-reference adaptive speed controller.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of a high-performance induction motor drive using a three-phase inverter module, a PWM ASIC and a DSP","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - APEC'95","doi":"10.1109/APEC.1995.469023","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - APEC'95","pdfPath":"/iel2/3292/9884/00469023.pdf","startPage":"217","endPage":"223 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.1995.469023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9884","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=469023","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/469023/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of a high-performance induction motor drive using a three-phase inverter module, a PWM ASIC and a DSP","conferenceDate":"5-9 March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5038623","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of a high-performance induction motor drive using a three-phase inverter module, a PWM ASIC and a DSP","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00469023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039354S","chronDate":"5-9 Mar 1995","isNumber":"9884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3292","citationCount":"2","articleId":"469023","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":469035,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Decoupled control of DC voltage for peak power tracking, and the quadrature component of AC output current for reactive power flow control is achieved. The inner current loop maintains a preset flow of reactive power from the power converter to the local load and the utility power system. The peak power tracking loop sets the reference value of the outer voltage loop.

Experimental results obtained from a MOSFET based 500 W power converter are presented to verify the analysis for this particular case.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/APEC.1995.469050","startPage":"920","endPage":"926 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - APEC'95","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.1995.469050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9885","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - APEC'95","pdfPath":"/iel2/3292/9885/00469050.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A generalized steady-state analysis of resonant converters using two-port model and Fourier-series approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/469050/","displayDocTitle":"A generalized steady-state analysis of resonant converters using two-port model and Fourier-series approach","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"5032614","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-9 March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Mar 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A generalized steady-state analysis of resonant converters using two-port model and Fourier-series approach","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00469050.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037016S","chronDate":"5-9 Mar 1995","isNumber":"9885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3292","citationCount":"4","articleId":"469050","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":469060,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Compared to other reported schemes, the inverter VA rating in this scheme is reduced by a factor of six. This reduction in the inverter VA rating is mainly due to the zero-sequence current inverter having a low VA rating. The equations for this active filter are derived.

The work is motivated by the need of an efficient and flexible modulation method, which is optimized with respect to minimum machine torque ripple. The modulation strategy is named Space Vector Modulation for Four Switch Inverter (SVMFSI) and is realized by planning the switching patterns between four active voltage vectors on the basis of a desired flux trajectory for the stator flux vector in the AC-machine (variable speed induction motor drive). The strategy is implemented in a single 8-bit microcontroller as a double sided modulation strategy. Simulations of the motor torque ripple are performed at a switching frequency of 4 kHz and indicate a torque ripple of 14% at nominal load. Finally, selected results are verified experimentally on a 1.5 kVA prototype B4 inverter. The test results indicate high quality output voltage spectra with no low-order voltage harmonics and a harmonic loss factor (HLF) of 1.12% at unity modulation index.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - APEC'95","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - APEC'95","pdfPath":"/iel2/3292/9885/00469079.pdf","startPage":"577","endPage":"585 vol.2","doi":"10.1109/APEC.1995.469079","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.1995.469079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9885","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new optimized space vector modulation strategy for a component minimized voltage source inverter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/469079/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"A new optimized space vector modulation strategy for a component minimized voltage source inverter","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5039313","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"5-9 March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new optimized space vector modulation strategy for a component minimized voltage source inverter","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00469079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034962S","chronDate":"5-9 Mar 1995","isNumber":"9885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3292","citationCount":"14","articleId":"469079","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":469081,"authors":[{"name":"A. von Jouanne","affiliation":["Power Electronics Laboratory Department of Electrical Engineering, Texas A and M University, TX, USA"],"firstName":"A.","lastName":"von Jouanne","id":"37331685200"},{"name":"P.

Switching frequencies of 10 to 20 kHz with 0.1 /spl mu/s rise times are common with the current insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) technology. In many industrial applications the PWM inverter and the motor must be at separate locations, thus requiring long motor leads. This paper examines the effect of long motor leads on high frequency PWM inverter fed AC motor drives. Cable transmission theory and cable capacitance analysis are presented and voltage reflections are investigated.

The ballast included a high voltage ignitor and dimming capability. It was used to drive and examine the high frequency characteristics of a commercial HPS lamp (NAV-T 150 W (SON-T), OSRAM). The experimental results reveal that for the frequency range of this study (27-75 kHz), the lamp is free of the acoustic resonance problem. It was also found that for the present experimental conditions, the lamp is purely resistive and that the resistance is practically independent of the power level and operating frequency. The lamp exhibited stable operation over a very large dimming range, down to about 7% of nominal power. The 2.8 kV ignition pulse was found to be sufficient for both cold and hot start up under the proposed operating conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/469091/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Mar 1995","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 March 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5039325","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design and performance of an electronic ballast for high pressure sodium (HPS) lamps","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and performance of an electronic ballast for high pressure sodium (HPS) lamps","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00469091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035513S","chronDate":"5-9 Mar 1995","isNumber":"9885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3292","citationCount":"7","articleId":"469091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":469092,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Unlike previous fiber-stretcher systems which were limited to picosecond pulse durations, these systems can be used effectively with 50-fs microjoule pulses or 100-fs millijoule pulses.

An important issue in providing guaranteed performance service is the choice of the packet service discipline at switching nodes. In this paper, we survey several service disciplines that are proposed in the literature to provide per-connection end-to-end performance guarantees in packet-switching networks. We describe their mechanisms, their similarities and differences and the performance guarantees they can provide. Various issues and tradeoffs in designing service disciplines for guaranteed performance service are discussed, and a general framework for studying and comparing these disciplines are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/469298/","volume":"83","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"5104378","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Service disciplines for guaranteed performance service in packet-switching networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Service disciplines for guaranteed performance service in packet-switching networks","sourcePdf":"00469298.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060631S","chronDate":"Oct.  1995","isNumber":"9895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"724","articleId":"469298","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":469379,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

The design directly addresses three major problems in FNS control systems: customization of control system parameters for a particular individual, adaptation during operation to account for changes in the musculoskeletal system, and attaining resistance to mechanical disturbances. The control system was implemented by a two-stage neural network that utilizes a combination of adaptive feedforward and feedback control techniques. A new learning algorithm was developed to provide rapid customization and adaptation. The control system was evaluated in a series of studies on a computer simulated musculoskeletal model. The model of electrically stimulated muscle used in the study included nonlinear recruitment, linear dynamics, and multiplicative nonlinear torque-angle and torque-velocity scaling factors. The skeletal model consisted of a one-segment planar system with passive constraints on joint movement. Results of the evaluation have demonstrated that the control system can provide automated customization of the feedforward controller parameters for a given musculoskeletal system. It can account for changes in the musculoskeletal system by adapting the feedforward controller parameters on-line and it can resist the effects of mechanical disturbances. These results suggest that this design may be suitable for the control of FNS systems and other dynamic systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/469379/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5109145","pubMedId":"7498916","volume":"42","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Neural network control of functional neuromuscular stimulation systems: computer simulation studies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network control of functional neuromuscular stimulation systems: computer simulation studies","sourcePdf":"00469379.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070674S","chronDate":"Nov.  1995","isNumber":"9897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"95","articleId":"469379","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":469381,"authors":[{"name":"R.

BV/sub ds/ was maintained at a level of junction breakdown before reaching the punchthrough limitation at a gate length of around 0.3 /spl mu/m using the FS isolation. The FS isolation technique was successfully applied to an SOG gate array on a SIMOX substrate. The gate array has the same area as that on the bulk-Si and is compatible to a conventional bulk-Si CAD system because the layout is basically the same.

First, noncoherent BFSK signaling under continuous-wave (CW) tone interference with arbitrary frequency offset is analyzed. A closed-form expression is derived for the error probability when there is one interfering CW tone and the background noise is negligible. When the background noise is significant, an expression involving one numerical integration is derived for the probability of error. It is shown that an interfering CW tone with power less than that of the signal can still cause errors with significant probability for certain ranges of carrier offsets. Next, the authors apply these results in analyzing the performance of a FHSS communications system under one-dimensional tone jamming when the communicator pseudorandomly jitters his carrier frequency from hop to hop. Two different methods of carrier jittering are considered. It is found that one of the schemes offers approximately a 3 dB gain in signal-to-noise ratio over a system without carrier jittering while the other scheme offers no significant gain.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jitter","Jamming","Frequency","Spread spectrum communication","Background noise","Interference","Signal analysis","Closed-form solution","Error probability","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["jitter","radiofrequency interference","jamming","interference suppression","frequency hop communication","spread spectrum communication","frequency shift keying","telecommunication signalling","error statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FHSS systems","carrier jitter","one-dimensional tone jamming","performance","frequency-hop spread-spectrum system","noncoherent BFSK signaling","continuous-wave tone interference","frequency offset","closed-form expression","error probability","background noise","numerical integration","signal-to-noise ratio"]}],"doi":"10.1109/26.469437","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/9900/00469437.pdf","startPage":"2622","endPage":"2629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9900","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.469437","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of FHSS systems employing carrier jitter against one-dimensional tone jamming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=469437","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of FHSS systems employing carrier jitter against one-dimensional tone jamming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/469437/","volume":"43","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5096324","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of FHSS systems employing carrier jitter against one-dimensional tone jamming","sourcePdf":"00469437.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057457S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"8","articleId":"469437","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":469440,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

The minimum-mean-squared-error decision-feedback equalizer (MMSE-DFE) has properties that suggest that it is a canonical equalization structure in systems that combine equalization with coded modulation. With a given symbol rate 1/T and transmit spectrum, the output signal-to-noise ratio SNR/sub MMSE-DFE,U/ of a MMSE-DFE with an unbiased decision rule is a single parameter that characterizes the channel for coding purposes. Indeed, the transmit spectrum that maximizes SNR/sub MMSE-DFE,U/ is the capacity-achieving (water-pouring) spectrum, and the capacity C(T) (in bits per two dimensions) is given by C(T)=log/sub 2/[1+SNR/sub MMSE-DFE,U/] regardless of the channel characteristics. The performance of a coded system with a MMSE-DFE equalization structure may be accurately estimated using the gain of the coding scheme at a given Pr(E). This performance is shown to be approximately the same as that of a multicarrier system using the same transmit spectrum and similar coding; such systems are known to be able to approach capacity arbitrarily closely. The MMSE-DFE can perform significantly better than a zero-forcing decision-feedback equalizer, particularly at moderate-to-low SNR's and on severe-ISI channels. Simulation results indicate that performance of the MMSE-DFE is surprisingly insensitive to transmit spectral shaping, as long as the transmit spectrum exceeds the capacity-achieving band, but that there is an optimal symbol rate that should (approximately) be used.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision feedback equalizers","Performance gain","Transmitters","Filters","Error probability","Modulation coding","Signal to noise ratio","Intersymbol interference","Adaptive signal processing","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision feedback equalisers","modulation coding","channel coding","spectral analysis","channel capacity","intersymbol interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum-mean-squared-error decision-feedback equalizer","coding","canonical equalization structure","coded modulation","symbol rate","transmit spectrum","output signal-to-noise ratio","unbiased decision rule","channel characteristics","performance","gain","multicarrier system","ISI channels","simulation","transmit spectral shaping","capacity achieving band","optimal symbol rate"]}],"doi":"10.1109/26.469440","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/9900/00469440.pdf","startPage":"2595","endPage":"2604","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9900","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.469440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MMSE decision-feedback equalizers and coding.

The structure and performance of the MMSE-DFE are succinctly derived using linear-estimation-theoretic principles in this first part of this two-part paper. The front-end of the MMSE-DFE, called the \"mean-square whitened matched filter\" (MS-WMF), is preferable in some ways to a matched filter or a whitened matched filter as a canonical receiver front end. In a coded system, the feedback filter of the MMSE-DFE may be implemented in the transmitter using precoding. The MMSE-DFE can perform significantly better than a zero-forcing decision-feedback equalizer, particularly at moderate-to-low SNR's and on severe-ISI channels. The MMSE-DFE is biased. The optimum unbiased MMSE-DFE is the MMSE-DFE with the bias removed. Removing bias improves error probability, but reduces the SNR to SNR/sub MMSE-DFE,U/=SNR/sub MMSE-DFE/-1. It is shown that this SNR relationship is a particular case of a very general result and that SNR/sub MMSE-DFE,U/ gives a more realistic estimate of SNR.

The presented approach is based on the SAR interferometric correlation and the backscatter intensities using ERS-1 SAR repeat-pass data. Baseline, time interval, and seasonal dependences were analyzed, substantiating a wide applicability of the approach. Data over an Alaskan test site were used to extend the results found over temperate forest to boreal forest and to demonstrate the potential of the described technique over remote areas. In addition, repeat-pass SAR interferometry was found to be particularly sensitive to change.

Multipolarization data (C-HH, C-VV, and C-HV) were used for discriminating 5 crop types i.e., corn, wheat, soya, pasture, and alfalfa. For the multipolarization evaluation, an unsupervised classification algorithm and a supervised method based on maximum likelihood were used on the data. For the textural evaluation, textural measures of different degrees were calculated on three different order histograms and were evaluated from the crop discrimination point of view. Results show that multipolarization correct classification rates of 86.31% and 74.47% were obtained for supervised and unsupervised methods respectively. Hence, multipolarization radar data offer an adequate tool for crop identification especially with supervised classification. The evaluation of textural measures shows that for a first order histogram the mean measure gives the best rate of discrimination. In the case of second and third order histograms, the best measures are contrast and large number emphasis respectively. These textural measures were integrated with the three multipolarization channels in order to determine their specific contributions. Results show that crop class separability is thereby improved and that the rate of correct classification increased by 9.79% for the crops.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/9902/00469481.pdf","startPage":"1170","endPage":"1181","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/36.469481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.469481","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9902","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=469481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of textural and multipolarization radar features for crop classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Crops","Classification algorithms","Histograms","Radar imaging","Remote sensing","Airborne radar","Spaceborne radar","Radar remote sensing","Synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","geophysical signal processing","agriculture","remote sensing by radar","radar applications","radar polarimetry","airborne radar","image classification","radar imaging","image texture","maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical measurement technique","radar remote sensing","agriculture crops","vegetation mapping","image texture","multipolarization radar","polarization","radar polarimetry","crop classification","image classification","radar imaging","airborne radar","corn wheat soya pasture alfalfa","unsupervised classification algorithm","supervised method","maximum likelihood method","crop identification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/469481/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of textural and multipolarization radar features for crop classification","volume":"33","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5109363","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of textural and multipolarization radar features for crop classification","sourcePdf":"00469481.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058185S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"116","articleId":"469481","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":469483,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

The simulator permits control of the type of digitization, the digitization thresholds with respect to noise power, and the degree of correlation between the two antenna signals which are being cross correlated. Digitization schemes are considered which use 2, 3, 4, and 8 levels. Estimates are made of the increase in inherent radiometer noise (/spl Delta/T) due to the digitization. The increase in /spl Delta/T is found to depend strongly on the degree of correlation, with higher correlations suffering less increase. In most cases, 3 level digitization is recommended based on this sensitivity consideration. Two levels perform significantly noisier and four levels only slightly cleaner. Several case studies are also considered regarding the need to control the signal level relative to the digitizer thresholds. Automatic gain control circuitry prior to digitization is found not to be necessary, provided the thresholds are preset within a fairly broad region of minimum sensitivity to variations in signal power, and provided the system noise temperature of the radiometer is monitored with reasonable accuracy. It is also found that, under conditions of very high correlation between the two signals, digital correlators have better SNR performance than analog. Reasons for this behavior are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.469486","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9902","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.469486","endPage":"1229","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/9902/00469486.pdf","startPage":"1222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital correlators for synthetic aperture interferometric radiometry","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/469486/","displayDocTitle":"Digital correlators for synthetic aperture interferometric radiometry","volume":"33","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"5109368","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital correlators for synthetic aperture interferometric radiometry","sourcePdf":"00469486.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029293S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"19","articleId":"469486","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":469489,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The traditional RGMAP speckle filter first defects contours belonging to step edges and thin linear structures, then applies the RGMAP filter to local statistics extracted from rectangular masks that do not cross image contours. The proposed modified RGMAP (MRGMAP) filter first exploits local operators belonging to the odd-symmetric filter category employed by RGMAP to detect image segments, then it computes local statistics over areas that are not necessarily rectangular, but are subsets of the image segments having any possible shape. Therefore, MRGMAP enhances the RGMAP ability in exploiting shape adaptive windowing near image contours, where speckle is not fully developed. The MRGMAP computation time is estimated to be of the same magnitude of that of the original RGMAP, the latter depending on the number of filter categories being employed. The qualitative and quantitative results of the MRGMAP filter applied to real SAR images are satisfactory as the filter seems to be effective in speckle removal whereas it retains edge sharpness and subtle details. However, tests on simulated SAR images must still be performed in order to provide definitive evidence supporting MRGMAP effectiveness. Since MRGMAP typically removes image structures featuring a constant reflectivity gradient, this filter is not particularly suitable for image enhancement in human photo-interpretation. MRGMAP can be rather employed as a preprocessing module in a computer-based SAR image classification procedure based on segment mean value analysis.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A refined gamma MAP SAR speckle filter with improved geometrical adaptivity","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/36.469489","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/9902/00469489.pdf","startPage":"1245","endPage":"1257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.469489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9902","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=469489","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/469489/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1995","displayDocTitle":"A refined gamma MAP SAR speckle filter with improved geometrical adaptivity","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5109371","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A refined gamma MAP SAR speckle filter with improved geometrical adaptivity","sourcePdf":"00469489.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053775S","chronDate":"Sept.  1995","isNumber":"9902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"97","articleId":"469489","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":469491,"authors":[{"name":"U.

The nonstandard FT is performed via a chirp z-transform that is carried out with one convolution operation and two phase multiplications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.469496","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/9902/00469496.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9902","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.469496","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","startPage":"1296","endPage":"1299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new method for the compensation of the SAR range cell migration based on the chirp z-transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=469496","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"A new method for the compensation of the SAR range cell migration based on the chirp z-transform","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/469496/","volume":"33","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5109377","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new method for the compensation of the SAR range cell migration based on the chirp z-transform","sourcePdf":"00469496.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025591S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"80","articleId":"469496","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":469514,"authors":[{"name":"Jung-Hong Chuang","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jung-Hong Chuang","id":"37268071600"},{"name":"Weun-Jier Hwang","affiliation":["Telecommunication Laboratories, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Weun-Jier Hwang","id":"38140690100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0272-1716"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1756"}],"articleNumber":"469514","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ray tracing","Rendering (computer graphics)","Classification tree analysis","Solid modeling","Layout","Computational geometry","Image recognition","Extraterrestrial phenomena","Reflection","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ray tracing","realistic images","solid modelling","rendering (computer graphics)","computational geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ray tracing","realistic images","constructive solid geometry","nonuniform space subdivision scheme","ray-object intersection computations","point classifications","face planes","primitive S-bounds","localized tree","leaf voxel"]}],"abstract":"Ray tracing successfully creates realistic images of constructive solid geometry (CSG) solids. We describe a nonuniform space subdivision scheme that reduces both the number of ray-object intersection computations and point classifications. Our method uses the face planes of the primitives' S-bounds in a bottom-up fashion and produces a subdivision wherein the localized CSG tree in each leaf voxel is greatly minimized. The use of S-bounds in the space subdivision effectively reduces the number of intersection computations as well. The reduction of the localized CSG tree in turn further reduces the number of intersection computations and point classifications. We briefly review existing methods for ray tracing CSG solids, describe our proposed space subdivision method, discuss our implementation and compare it to Bouatouch's (1987) method, and summarize our test results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/38.469514","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/38/9904/00469514.pdf","startPage":"56","endPage":"62","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/38.469514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9904","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new space subdivision for ray tracing CSG solids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=469514","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/469514/","displayDocTitle":"A new space subdivision for ray tracing CSG solids","volume":"15","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","accessionNumber":"5101142","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new space subdivision for ray tracing CSG solids","sourcePdf":"00469514.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036629S","chronDate":"Nov 1995","isNumber":"9904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"38","citationCount":"2","articleId":"469514","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":469659,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We describe first a technique based upon the selection of appropriate multiple-output subnetworks (consisting of so-called compatible gates) whose local functions can be optimized simultaneously. We then generalize the method to optimize larger and more arbitrary subsets of gates, called unate subsets. Because simultaneous optimization of local functions can take place, our methods are more powerful and general than Boolean optimization methods using don't cares, where only single-gate optimization can be performed. In addition, our methods represent a more efficient alternative to Boolean relations-based optimization procedures because the problem can be modeled by a unate covering problem instead of the more difficult binate covering problem. The method is implemented in program ACHILLES and compares favorably to SIS.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.469659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.469659","startPage":"1316","endPage":"1327","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/9906/00469659.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9906","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of combinational logic circuits based on compatible gates","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/469659/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1995","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of combinational logic circuits based on compatible gates","volume":"14","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5107774","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of combinational logic circuits based on compatible gates","sourcePdf":"00469659.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077586S","chronDate":"Nov 1995","isNumber":"9906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"4","articleId":"469659","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":469721,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Herein we concentrate on a recent graph based data model called the hypernode model. The single underlying data structure of this model is the hypernode which is a digraph with a unique defining label. We present in detail the three components of the model, namely its data structure, the hypernode, its query and update language, called HNQL, and its provision for enforcing integrity constraints. We first demonstrate that the said data model is a natural candidate for formalising hypertext. We then compare it with other graph based data models and with set based data models. We also investigate the expressive power of HNQL. Finally, using the hypernode model as a paradigm for graph based data modelling, we show how to bridge the gap between graph based and set based data models, and at what computational cost this can be done.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/69.469818","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","startPage":"809","endPage":"823","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/69/9912/00469818.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/69.469818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9912","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A graph-based data model and its ramifications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data models","Relational databases","Application software","Business","Data structures","Computer aided software engineering","Data analysis","Computer science","Computer Society","Bridges"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hypermedia","data structures","directed graphs","query languages","data integrity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph based data model","graph-based data model","database researchers","flat relational model","nonbusiness applications","hypernode model","underlying data structure","digraph","unique defining label","update language","HNQL","integrity constraints","set based data models","expressive power","computational cost","hypertext"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"A graph-based data model and its ramifications","volume":"7","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5103903","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/469818/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A graph-based data model and its ramifications","sourcePdf":"00469818.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047202S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9912","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"29","articleId":"469818","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":469820,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohui Song","affiliation":["3M Electronic Imaging Center, 3M Company, Saint Paul, MN, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaohui Song","id":"37383096200"},{"name":"J.W.S.

In our model, a hard real time system consists of periodic tasks which are either write only, read only or update transactions. Transactions may share data. Data objects are temporally inconsistent when their ages and dispersions are greater than the absolute and relative thresholds allowed by the application. Real time transactions must read temporally consistent data in order to deliver correct results. Based on this model, we have evaluated the performance of two well known classes of concurrency control algorithms that handle multiversion data: the two phase locking and the optimistic algorithms, as well as the rate monotonic and earliest deadline first scheduling algorithms. The effects of using the priority inheritance and stack based protocols with lock based concurrency control are also studied.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9912","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/69/9912/00469820.pdf","doi":"10.1109/69.469820","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/69.469820","startPage":"786","endPage":"796","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maintaining temporal consistency: pessimistic vs. optimistic concurrency control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/469820/","displayDocTitle":"Maintaining temporal consistency: pessimistic vs. optimistic concurrency control","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"5103901","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maintaining temporal consistency: pessimistic vs. optimistic concurrency control","sourcePdf":"00469820.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06531S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9912","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"65","articleId":"469820","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":469825,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-Tae Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Dongguk University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jun-Tae Kim","id":"37384884700"},{"name":"D.I.

In knowledge based information extraction, linguistic patterns play a central role in the recognition and classification of input texts. Although the knowledge based approach has been proved effective for information extraction on limited domains, there are difficulties in construction of a large number of domain specific linguistic patterns. Manual creation of patterns is time consuming and error prone, even for a small application domain. To solve the scalability and the portability problem, an automatic acquisition of patterns must be provided. We present the PALKA (Parallel Automatic Linguistic Knowledge Acquisition) system that acquires linguistic patterns from a set of domain specific training texts and their desired outputs. A specialized representation of patterns called FP structures has been defined. Patterns are constructed in the form of FP structures from training texts, and the acquired patterns are tuned further through the generalization of semantic constraints. Inductive learning mechanism is applied in the generalization step. The PALKA system has been used to generate patterns for our information extraction system developed for the fourth Message Understanding Conference (MUC-4).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/469825/","volume":"7","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"5103896","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Acquisition of linguistic patterns for knowledge-based information extraction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acquisition of linguistic patterns for knowledge-based information extraction","sourcePdf":"00469825.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043027S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9912","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"49","articleId":"469825","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":469828,"authors":[{"name":"M.

These neural networks are used as specialized parallel distributed processors for solving constraint satisfaction problems. A typical application of such a neural network is to determine a reasonable change of a system after one or more of its variables are changed. A six-node neural network is developed to represent fundamental qualitative relations. A larger neural network can be constructed hierarchically for a system to be modeled by using six-node neural networks as building blocks. The complexity of the neural network building process is thus kept manageable. An example of developing a neural network reasoning model for a transistor equivalent circuit is demonstrated. The use of this neural network model in the equivalent circuit parameter extraction process is also described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/469828/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5103893","volume":"7","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Representing knowledge by neural networks for qualitative analysis and reasoning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Representing knowledge by neural networks for qualitative analysis and reasoning","sourcePdf":"00469828.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045427S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9912","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"10","articleId":"469828","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":469829,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Representations with signal-dependent kernels can overcome this limitation. However, while they often perform well, most existing schemes are block-oriented techniques unsuitable for on-line implementation or for tracking signal components with characteristics that change with time. The time-frequency representation developed in the present paper, based on a signal-dependent radially Gaussian kernel that adapts over time, surmounts these difficulties. The method employs a short-time ambiguity function both for kernel optimization and as an intermediate step in computing constant-time slices of the representation. Careful algorithm design provides reasonably efficient computation and allows on-line implementation. Certain enhancements, such as cone-kernel constraints and approximate retention of marginals, are easily incorporated with little additional computation. While somewhat more expensive than fixed kernel representations, this new technique often provides much better performance. Several examples illustrate its behavior on synthetic and real-world signals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.469854","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/9913/00469854.pdf","startPage":"2361","endPage":"2371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.469854","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive optimal-kernel time-frequency representation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=469854","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/469854/","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive optimal-kernel time-frequency representation","volume":"43","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5091663","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive optimal-kernel time-frequency representation","sourcePdf":"00469854.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033284S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"260","articleId":"469854","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":469861,"authors":[{"name":"R.G.

Implementation of these new tools involves simply preprocessing the signal by a unitary transformation, performing standard processing on the transformed signal, and then (in some cases) transforming the resulting output. The resulting unitarily equivalent systems can focus on the critical signal characteristics in large classes of signals and, hence, prove useful for representing and processing signals that are not well matched by current techniques. As specific examples of this procedure, we generalize linear time-invariant systems, orthonormal basis and frame decompositions, and joint time-frequency and time-scale distributions. These applications illustrate the utility of the unitary equivalence concept for uniting seemingly disparate approaches proposed in the literature.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/9913/00469861.pdf","startPage":"2269","endPage":"2282","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.469861","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.469861","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9913","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=469861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unitary equivalence: a new twist on signal processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing","Signal analysis","Time frequency analysis","Fourier transforms","Wavelet analysis","Wavelet transforms","Signal processing algorithms","Biomedical signal processing","Wideband","Chirp"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal processing","time-frequency analysis","transforms","linear systems","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal processing","unitary similarity transformations","unitary equivalence","infinite generic classes","signal analysis","transformed signal","signal characteristics","linear time-invariant systems","orthonormal basis","frame decompositions","time-frequency distribution","time-scale distribution","signal representation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/469861/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"Unitary equivalence: a new twist on signal processing","volume":"43","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5091656","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unitary equivalence: a new twist on signal processing","sourcePdf":"00469861.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064171S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"186","articleId":"469861","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":469863,"authors":[{"name":"A.B.

Three simple adaptive beamforming methods were employed for the experimental data processing. The first one is based on the well-known projection approach to adaptive beamforming, the second method uses the adaptive canceler approach (also termed the dipole pattern method), and the third method combines these approaches. The signal-to-interference power ratio (SIR) threshold of the signal localization and tracking is evaluated by a special technique, which allows examination of the considered algorithms with change of the SIR in consecutive order. The results of the data processing show the high possibilities of signal localization in the presence of strong interference. The combined method performs better than the methods considered and enables localization of the signal source up to an SIR/spl sime/-25 dB.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.469863","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/9913/00469863.pdf","startPage":"2249","endPage":"2257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.469863","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental results of localization of moving underwater signal by adaptive beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=469863","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/469863/","displayDocTitle":"Experimental results of localization of moving underwater signal by adaptive beamforming","volume":"43","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5091654","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental results of localization of moving underwater signal by adaptive beamforming","sourcePdf":"00469863.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04197S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"55","articleId":"469863","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":469929,"authors":[{"name":"S.

It is well known that DPCM systems are very sensitive to channel errors. The goal in this work is to build robustness against channel errors. Three methods are proposed in this paper and are obtained by modeling the encoded signal as a Markov sequence. First, an optimum method for decoding correlated sequences is derived, and it is shown to require Viterbi decoding. Then, a modified MAP method (MMAP) for Markov sequences is described. A maximal signal-to-noise (MSNR) receiver for DPCM systems is also developed that minimizes the distortion power due to channel errors. The appropriate cost matrix for this receiver is computed. These methods are applied to DPCM picture transmission over noisy channels and are compared with a another method. The SNR graphs, as well as subjective examination of the received pictures, demonstrate that the proposed procedures are quite effective and superior to that method. Among the proposed methods, the MSNR receiver was found to be more effective than the others for a given order of the Markov model.

It combines the concepts of predictive vector quantization (PVQ) and residual vector quantization (RVQ) to implement a high performance VQ scheme with low search complexity. The proposed PRVQ consists of a vector predictor, designed by a multilayer perceptron, and an RVQ that is designed by a multilayer competitive neural network. A major task in our proposed PRVQ design is the joint optimization of the vector predictor and the RVQ codebooks. In order to achieve this, a new design based on the neural network learning algorithm is introduced. This technique is basically a nonlinear constrained optimization where each constituent component of the PRVQ scheme is optimized by minimizing an appropriate stage error function with a constraint on the overall error. This technique makes use of a Lagrangian formulation and iteratively solves a Lagrangian error function to obtain a locally optimal solution. This approach is then compared to a jointly designed and a closed-loop design approach. In the jointly designed approach, the predictor and quantizers are jointly optimized by minimizing only the overall error. In the closed-loop design, however, a predictor is first implemented; then the stage quantizers are optimized for this predictor in a stage-by-stage fashion. Simulation results show that the proposed PRVQ scheme outperforms the equivalent RVQ (operating at the same bit rate) and the unconstrained VQ by 2 and 1.7 dB, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed PRVQ outperforms the PVQ in the rate-distortion sense with significantly lower codebook search complexity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/9915/00469930.pdf","startPage":"1482","endPage":"1495","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.469930","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.469930","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9915","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=469930","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictive residual vector quantization [image coding]","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vector quantization","Image coding","Design optimization","Multi-layer neural network","Neural networks","Constraint optimization","Lagrangian functions","Multilayer perceptrons","Algorithm design and analysis","Iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","vector quantisation","multilayer perceptrons","prediction theory","optimisation","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["predictive residual vector quantization","PRVQ","predictive vector quantization","residual vector quantization","high performance VQ scheme","low search complexity","multilayer perceptron","multilayer competitive neural network","neural network learning algorithm","nonlinear constrained optimization","stage error function","Lagrangian formulation","Lagrangian error function","locally optimal solution","rate-distortion","codebooks","closed-loop design","image coding","data compression"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/469930/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Predictive residual vector quantization [image coding]","volume":"4","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","accessionNumber":"5117251","pubMedId":"18291981","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive residual vector quantization [image coding]","sourcePdf":"00469930.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065314S","chronDate":"Nov.  1995","isNumber":"9915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"17","articleId":"469930","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":469935,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The analysis uses an overcomplete wavelet decomposition, which yields a description that is translation invariant. It is shown that this representation constitutes a tight frame of l/sub 2/ and that it has a fast iterative algorithm. A texture is characterized by a set of channel variances estimated at the output of the corresponding filter bank. Classification experiments with l/sub 2/ Brodatz textures indicate that the discrete wavelet frame (DWF) approach is superior to a standard (critically sampled) wavelet transform feature extraction. These results also suggest that this approach should perform better than most traditional single resolution techniques (co-occurrences, local linear transform, and the like). A detailed comparison of the classification performance of various orthogonal and biorthogonal wavelet transforms is also provided. Finally, the DWF feature extraction technique is incorporated into a simple multicomponent texture segmentation algorithm, and some illustrative examples are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.469936","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/9915/00469936.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.469936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9915","startPage":"1549","endPage":"1560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Texture classification and segmentation using wavelet frames","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=469936","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Texture classification and segmentation using wavelet frames","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/469936/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","accessionNumber":"5117257","pubMedId":"18291987","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Texture classification and segmentation using wavelet frames","sourcePdf":"00469936.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045705S","chronDate":"Nov.  1995","isNumber":"9915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"917","articleId":"469936","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":469937,"authors":[{"name":"Haiqing Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Laval University, QUE, Canada"],"lastName":"Haiqing Wu","id":"37087648554"},{"name":"D.

This paper presents a novel two-step approach to translational motion compensation using an adaptive range tracking method for range bin alignment and a recursive multiple-scatterer algorithm (RMSA) for signal phase compensation. The initial step of RMSA is equivalent to the dominant-scatterer algorithm (DSA). An error-compensating point source is then recursively synthesized from the selected range bins, where each contains a prominent scatterer. Since the clutter-induced phase errors are reduced by phase averaging, the image speckle noise can be reduced significantly. Experimental data processing for a commercial aircraft and computer simulations confirm the validity of the approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/9915/00469937.pdf","startPage":"1561","endPage":"1571","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.469937","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.469937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9915","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=469937","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Translational motion compensation in ISAR image processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion compensation","Image processing","Computer errors","Inverse synthetic aperture radar","Radar imaging","Synthetic aperture radar","Radar tracking","Target tracking","Signal synthesis","Radar scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synthetic aperture radar","motion compensation","radar imaging","radar tracking","electromagnetic wave scattering","inverse problems","speckle","error compensation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["translational motion compensation","ISAR image processing","inverse synthetic aperture radar","two-step approach","adaptive range tracking method","range bin alignment","recursive multiple-scatterer algorithm","signal phase compensation","dominant-scatterer algorithm","error-compensating point source","clutter-induced phase errors","phase averaging","image speckle noise","commercial aircraft","computer simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/469937/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Translational motion compensation in ISAR image processing","volume":"4","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","accessionNumber":"5117258","pubMedId":"18291988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Translational motion compensation in ISAR image processing","sourcePdf":"00469937.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04467S","chronDate":"Nov.  1995","isNumber":"9915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"84","articleId":"469937","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":469957,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Each connection between a pair of nodes in the network is assigned a path through the network and a wavelength on that path, such that connections whose paths share a common link in the network are assigned different wavelengths.

The bound scales with the number of wavelengths and is achieved asymptotically (when a large number of wavelengths is available) by a fixed RWA algorithm. The bound can be used as a metric against which the performance of different RWA algorithms can be compared for networks of moderate size. The authors illustrate this by comparing the performance of a simple shortest-path RWA (SP-RWA) algorithm via simulation relative to the bound. They also derive a similar bound for optical networks using dynamic wavelength converters, which are equivalent to circuit-switched telephone networks, and compare the two cases. Finally, they quantify the amount of wavelength reuse achievable in large networks using the SP-RWA via simulation as a function of the number of wavelengths, number of edges, and number of nodes for randomly constructed networks as well as de Bruijn networks. They also quantify the difference in wavelength reuse between two different optical node architectures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/90.469957","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","startPage":"489","endPage":"500","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/9916/00469957.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.469957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Routing and wavelength assignment in all-optical networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelength routing","Wavelength assignment","All-optical networks","Optical fiber networks","Circuit simulation","Wavelength division multiplexing","WDM networks","Upper bound","Telecommunication traffic","Optical wavelength conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelength division multiplexing","telecommunication network routing","optical fibre networks","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["routing and wavelength assignment","all-optical networks","routing connections","reconfigurable optical network","WDM","traffic","blocking probability","RWA algorithm","performance","SP-RWA","dynamic wavelength converters","wavelength reuse","edge numbers","node numbers","de Bruijn networks","optical node architectures"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"Routing and wavelength assignment in all-optical networks","volume":"3","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5104788","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/469957/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Routing and wavelength assignment in all-optical networks","sourcePdf":"00469957.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028833S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9916","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"601","articleId":"469957","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":469970,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In order to avoid overgeneralization, the basis of the hardware required for detection and recording of the PD pulses is described by reference to a particular system, it being understood that many detailed variations are possible depending on the application. The paper describes a number of parameters that can be calculated by software and used to characterize the PD behavior. These include the IEC-270 integrated quantities, statistical moments and other fingerprints for recognizing the PD patterns within the power frequency cycle. Examples are given of the patterns obtained on equipment and samples. These are necessarily selective and are intended to indicate how the techniques may be applied. It is concluded that these new methods will become valuable in procedures for assessing the condition of electrical insulation, in particular faults or defects, but must be used in conjunction with existing techniques until improved confidence is achieved in interpreting results, especially in respect of the various phase-resolved distributions and calibration procedures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/94.469978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9917","startPage":"838","endPage":"856","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel4/94/9917/00469978.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of computer-based measurements and their application to PD pattern analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/469978/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Development of computer-based measurements and their application to PD pattern analysis","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5120844","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"2","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of computer-based measurements and their application to PD pattern analysis","sourcePdf":"00469978.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098994S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"87","articleId":"469978","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":469983,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Of the various detection means available, most success has been achieved with either acoustic transducers to detect sound waves from the discharge, or electrical couplers to pick up the ultra-high-frequency (UHF) signals generated inside the GIS chambers. All new GIS in the UK are fitted with internal couplers for UHF monitoring, and two examples of continuous monitoring schemes on 400 kV GIS at nuclear power stations are described. Further developments, which are already well advanced, include specifying and measuring the coupler characteristics, making use of expert systems to interpret the UHF discharge data, and extending the monitoring system to include the performance of circuit breakers and other equipment.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/94.469984","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel4/94/9917/00469984.pdf","startPage":"893","endPage":"905","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/94.469984","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial discharge diagnostics for gas insulated substations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=469984","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/469984/","displayDocTitle":"Partial discharge diagnostics for gas insulated substations","volume":"2","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","accessionNumber":"5120849","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial discharge diagnostics for gas insulated substations","sourcePdf":"00469984.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05078S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"148","articleId":"469984","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":469997,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Another important problem is the communication between the vehicle and the outside world during the charging process. This article describes a system combining energy transfer and signal transmission in one unit, which is able to solve all of the above-mentioned problems. Minimal power electronic components are installed in the vehicle. The system uses contactless energy transmission employing an inductive high-frequency coupler. The charging process is monitored and controlled by an onboard charge meter, which can communicate with the converter outside the vehicle via the signal transmission included in the inductive coupler. A laboratory setup able to transfer up to 5 kW was built to demonstrate the performance of the system. The efficiency of the overall system, including all filters, converters, and rectifiers, is at a power level of 5 kW better than 92%.
