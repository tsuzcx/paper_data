In this paper, the multiple antenna physical layer multicasting channel is considered, in which a common message is simultaneously transmitted to multiple single-antenna users. To achieve the capacity of this multicasting set-up, the covariance matrix of the transmit signal vector needs to be determined to maximize the smallest maximum achievable rate among all the users. In this paper, we develop a simple successive algorithm to determine the covariance matrix of the signal vector under the assumption that channel state information (CSI) is perfectly available at the transmitter. We first characterize properties of the capacity achieving covariance matrix and derive a closed-form expression for the matrix in the two-user case. We then derive a closed-form expression for the rate maximizing beamformer in the case of two users and propose a successive beamforming algorithm that generates the beamforming vector with low computational complexity. In the proposed precoding design scheme, the covariance matrix is successively constructed by orthogonalizing the subspace spanned by each user's channel vector until the maximum number of recursions (which is the same as the minimum of the number of transmit antennas and the number of users) is reached. The achievable rate of the proposed scheme is compared with the capacity of optimal transmission, transmit beamforming, antenna subset selection, and open-loop transmission which does not require CSI at the transmitter. As the number of users and/or antennas grows large, it is shown that the average achievable rate of the proposed scheme achieves the same average achievable rate scaling as the true capacity while reducing the computational complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5910101/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12206211","htmlLink":"/document/5910101/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal and Successive Approaches to Signal Design for Multiple Antenna Physical Layer Multicasting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal and Successive Approaches to Signal Design for Multiple Antenna Physical Layer Multicasting","sourcePdf":"2316-tc1108-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101168S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5986797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5986797","articleId":"5910101","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5910105,"authors":[{"name":"Yang-wen Liang","affiliation":["Research in Motion, Waterloo, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6020878/5910105/5910105-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yang-wen Liang (S'02) received his B.Eng degree in electrical engineering from McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada, in 2004, and his M.A.Sc degree in electrical engineering from the University of British Columbia (UBC), Vancouver, Canada, in 2006.

The source BF vector and the AF-BF matrices at the relays are optimized for maximization of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the destination under three different power constraints. In particular, we consider individual relay power constraints, a joint relay power constraint, and a joint power constraint for the source and the relays. We solve the associated optimization problems in two stages. In the first stage, we find the optimal AF-BF matrices for a given BF vector at the source. For the cases of individual and joint relay power constraints, closed-form solutions for the AF-BF matrices are provided, respectively. Furthermore, for the case of a joint source-relay power constraint, the AF-BF matrices are obtained in closed form up to a scalar power allocation factor and an efficient numerical algorithm for the power allocation between the source and the relays is given. In the second stage, the optimal source BF vectors are computed. Thereby, we show that for the joint relay and the joint source-relay power constraints, the resulting problem can be transformed into a non-convex polynomial programming problem which allows for an exact solution for small-scale networks. For large-scale networks and networks with individual relay power constraints, we propose efficient suboptimal optimization methods for the source BF vector. Simulation results show the benefits of having multiple antennas at the source and/or multiple multi-antenna relays and illustrate the performance differences introduced by the three different power constraints.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5910105/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","volume":"59","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"12228285","publicationDate":"September 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5910105/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Amplify-and-Forward Beamforming with Multiple Multi-Antenna Relays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Amplify-and-Forward Beamforming with Multiple Multi-Antenna Relays","sourcePdf":"2605-tc1109-liang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07014S","chronDate":"September  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6020878","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6020878","articleId":"5910105","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5910108,"authors":[{"name":"Haiqiang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China","School of Computer, Electronics and Information, Guangxi University, Nanning, China"],"firstName":"Haiqiang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37716969900"},{"name":"Kai Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37713464900"},{"name":"Xiao Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Ma","id":"37279526900"},{"name":"Baoming Bai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Baoming","lastName":"Bai","id":"37290479800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"5910108","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1231},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Reliability","Parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative decoding","parity check codes","random codes","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliability-based iterative min-sum decoding","random LDPC codes","reliability-based iterative majority-logic decoding","MRBI-MLGD algorithm","RBI-MSD algorithm","reliability-based integer messages","binary logical operation","integer addition","decoding convergence rate","quantization bits","scaling factor","discretized density evolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","min-sum decoding","reliability-based decoding","soft-decision decoding","structured LDPC codes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5910108","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5952306/05910108.pdf","startPage":"1766","endPage":"1771","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.060911.100065","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.060911.100065","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5952306","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparisons Between Reliability-Based Iterative Min-Sum and Majority-Logic Decoding Algorithms for LDPC Codes","abstract":"A modified reliability-based iterative majority-logic decoding (MRBI-MLGD) algorithm for two classes of structured LDPC codes is presented based on a recent work by Huang et al. Compared with the original one, the modified algorithm has better performance with slightly increased complexity. Then a reliability-based iterative min-sum decoding (RBI-MSD) algorithm is presented. For the presented RBI-MSD algorithm, reliability-based integer messages are processed and exchanged between variable nodes and check nodes. The main computations include only binary logical operations and integer additions. Different from the conventional min-sum algorithm, the variable nodes pass full messages rather than extrinsic messages to check nodes. This can reduce the memory loads and the computational complexity but with a little (or negligible) performance degradation. Simulation results show that, compared with the (M)RBI-MLGD algorithms, the presented RBI-MSD algorithm achieves better error performance, faster decoding convergence rate and fewer quantization bits with moderate increased computational complexity. Furthermore, the RBI-MSD algorithm is also applicable to decoding random LDPC codes, a distinct difference from the (M)RBI-MLGD algorithms. Finally, we point out that the scaling factors employed in the MRBI-MLGD algorithm and the RBI-MSD algorithm can be optimized using discretized density evolution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5910108/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","volume":"59","issue":"7","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12109849","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5910108/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Comparisons Between Reliability-Based Iterative Min-Sum and Majority-Logic Decoding Algorithms for LDPC Codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparisons Between Reliability-Based Iterative Min-Sum and Majority-Logic Decoding Algorithms for LDPC Codes","sourcePdf":"1766-tc1107-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102314S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5952306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5952306","articleId":"5910108","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5910109,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6020878/5910109/5910109-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peng Liu received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in electrical engineering from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in July 2005 and July 2007, respectively.

In SM, the fraction of degree-i nodes are successively maximized starting from i = 2 with the constraint that the ensemble remains convergent over the channel. In this paper, we propose SM to design universally capacity approaching rate-compatible LDPC code ensemble sequences over the general class of Binary-Input Output-Symmetric Memoryless (BIOSM) channels. This is achieved by first generalizing the SM method to other BIOSM channels to design a sequence of capacity approaching ensembles called the parent sequence. The SM principle is then applied to each ensemble within the parent sequence, this time to design rate-compatible puncturing schemes. As part of our results, we extend the stability condition which was previously derived for degree-2 variable nodes to other variable node degrees as well as to the case of rate-compatible codes. Consequently, we prove that using the SM principle, one is able to design universally capacity achieving rate-compatible LDPC code ensemble sequences over the BEC. Unlike the previous results in the literature, the proposed SM approach is naturally extendable to other BIOSM channels. The performance of the rate-compatible schemes designed based on our method is comparable to those designed by optimization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5910111/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","volume":"59","issue":"7","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12157801","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5910111/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Successive Maximization for Systematic Design of Universally Capacity Approaching Rate-Compatible Sequences of LDPC Code Ensembles over Binary-Input Output-Symmetric Memoryless Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Successive Maximization for Systematic Design of Universally Capacity Approaching Rate-Compatible Sequences of LDPC Code Ensembles over Binary-Input Output-Symmetric Memoryless Channels","sourcePdf":"1807-tc1107-saeedi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135953S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5952306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5952306","articleId":"5910111","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5910112,"authors":[{"name":"Hayssam Dahrouj","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5986797/5910112/5910112-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hayssam Dahrouj (S'02-M'11) received the B.E. degree in Computer and Communications Engineering with high distinction from the American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in 2010.","Dr. Hayssam Dahrouj is currently a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto, collaborating with BLiNQ Networks Inc., Kanata, Ontario, Canada.

This paper proposes methods and examines the benefit of designing decodable interference signals, whereby a transmitter may split its message into a common and a private part, and the common message may be decoded and subtracted by users in adjacent cells. This paper considers a downlink scenario, where the base-stations are equipped with multiple antennas, the mobile users are equipped with a single antenna, and multiple users are active simultaneously via spatial multiplexing. The network optimization problem consists of jointly determining the appropriate users in adjacent cells for rate splitting, the optimal transmit beamformers for common and private messages, and the optimal common-private rates to maximize the minimum achievable rate across the users. This paper shows that for fixed user selection and fixed common-private rate splitting, the optimization of transmit beamformers can be solved using a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation approach. Further, it is shown that for the case where the network consists of two message-splitting pairs, SDP relaxation is tight, i.e., beamforming is optimal. Finally, this paper proposes a heuristic user-selection and rate splitting strategy to characterize the performance improvement for cell-edge users due to common-message decoding.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5986797/05910112.pdf","startPage":"2264","endPage":"2273","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.060911.100554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.060911.100554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5986797","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5910112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multicell Interference Mitigation with Joint Beamforming and Common Message Decoding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Interference","Array signal processing","Optimization","Joints","Receivers","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","cellular radio","decoding","interference suppression","mathematical programming","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicell interference mitigation","joint beamforming","common message decoding","wireless cellular systems","out-of-cell interference","decodable interference signal design","adjacent cells","downlink scenario","base-stations","multiple antennas","mobile users","spatial multiplexing","single antenna","network optimization problem","optimal transmit beamformers","optimal common-private rates","fixed user selection","fixed common-private rate splitting","semidefinite programming","SDP relaxation approach","message-splitting pairs","heuristic user-selection strategy","cell-edge users"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming","Han-Kobayashi strategy","interference channel","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","multiuser multiantenna multicell network","semidefinite programming (SDP)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5910112/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multicell Interference Mitigation with Joint Beamforming and Common Message Decoding","volume":"59","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5910112/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12206213","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicell Interference Mitigation with Joint Beamforming and Common Message Decoding","sourcePdf":"2264-tc1108-dahrouj.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108748S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5986797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5986797","articleId":"5910112","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5910114,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Tian","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5986797/5910114/5910114-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Feng Tian (S'07, M'09) received his Ph.D. degree from the department of electronic engineering, the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Hong Kong SAR, China, in 2009.

In this paper, distributed space-time block coding (STBC) is proposed for a two-path successive decode-and-forward relay network that can achieve both full rate and full diversity when perfect decoding is enabled at the relays. For the case of imperfect decoding, selection relaying is proposed with the distributed STBC to recover the full diversity. For the practical scenario in which the inter-relay channel is subject to fading, the two-path successive relaying transmission may not always be successful; for such cases an adaptive relaying scheme is proposed that can select a proper transmission mode between two-phase relaying transmission and two-path successive relaying transmission based on the channel quality of the relay network. Analytical results show that the proposed distributed STBC can offer both full diversity and a large symbol rate gain.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.060911.100686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5986797","startPage":"2254","endPage":"2263","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5986797/05910114.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Effective Distributed Space-Time Code for Two-Path Successive Relay Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5910114/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5910114/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Effective Distributed Space-Time Code for Two-Path Successive Relay Network","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12206214","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"8","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Effective Distributed Space-Time Code for Two-Path Successive Relay Network","sourcePdf":"2254-tc1108-tian.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098537S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5986797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5986797","articleId":"5910114","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5910115,"authors":[{"name":"Maziyar Hamdi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5985568/5910115/5910115-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Maziyar Hamdi (S'09) was born in Boroujerd, Iran, in 1986.

With regard to a simple practical realization, we focus on a non-coherent system setup in conjunction with amplify-and-forward (A&F) relaying. In particular, we propose to employ a multiple-differential encoding scheme at the source node and single differential decoding at each relay and at the destination node, respectively, so as to efficiently limit intersymbol-interference effects at the destination node. For a dual-hop system we derive a closed-form expression for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the destination node, and for the general multi-hop case we provide a simple recursive formula for SNR calculation. Based on these SNR results, we obtain a closed-form expression for the optimal transmit power allocation to the source node and the relay for a dual-hop system and a simple recursive suboptimal power allocation scheme for the multi-hop case, which permits a semi-distributed implementation with limited feedback between nodes. Simulation results illustrate the excellent performance of the proposed multiple-differential encoding scheme with A&F relaying for both uncoded and coded transmission compared to various alternative coherent and non-coherent schemes based on A&F relaying and decode-and-forward (D&F) relaying. Furthermore, our simulations confirm the (near-)optimal performance of the proposed power allocation solutions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5985568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.060811.100582","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5985568/05910115.pdf","startPage":"2577","endPage":"2591","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.060811.100582","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple-Differential Encoding for Multi-Hop Amplify-and-Forward IR-UWB Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","displayDocTitle":"Multiple-Differential Encoding for Multi-Hop Amplify-and-Forward IR-UWB Systems","volume":"10","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5910115/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12205942","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5910115/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple-Differential Encoding for Multi-Hop Amplify-and-Forward IR-UWB Systems","sourcePdf":"2577-tw1108-hamdi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087096S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5985568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5985568","articleId":"5910115","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5910117,"authors":[{"name":"Hangguan Shan","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, Department of Information and Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5985568/5910117/5910117-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hangguan Shan (M'10) received his B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees respectively from Zhejiang University and Fudan University, in 2004 and 2009, all in electrical engineering.

We focus on beneficial node cooperation by addressing two fundamental issues of cooperative communications, namely when to cooperate and whom to cooperate with, from a cross-layer protocol design perspective. In the protocol design, taking account of protocol overhead we explore a concept of cooperation region, whereby beneficial cooperative transmissions can be identified. We show that a rate allocation in the cooperation region provides higher link utilization than in a non-cooperation region. To increase network throughput, we propose an optimal grouping strategy for efficient helper node selection, and devise a greedy algorithm for MAC protocol refinement. Analysis of a successful transmission probability with cooperative or direct transmission is presented. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can effectively exploit beneficial cooperation, thereby improving system performance. Further, analytical and simulation results shed some light on the tradeoff between multi-user diversity gain at the physical layer and the helper contention overhead at the MAC layer.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.060811.101196","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5985568/05910117.pdf","startPage":"2603","endPage":"2615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.060811.101196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5985568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer Cooperative MAC Protocol in Distributed Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5910117","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5910117/","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Cooperative MAC Protocol in Distributed Wireless Networks","volume":"10","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12205944","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5910117/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Cooperative MAC Protocol in Distributed Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"2603-tw1108-shan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112258S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5985568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"5985568","articleId":"5910117","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5910119,"authors":[{"name":"Redha M.

The transmit channels are assumed to be sufficiently separated and undergo Rayleigh fading conditions.

The number of active transmit channels is adjusted adaptively based on statistically unordered and/or ordered instantaneous signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), where the transmitter has no information about the statistics of undesired signals. The adaptation thresholds are identified to guarantee a target performance level, and the adaptation schemes with enhanced spectral efficiency or power efficiency are studied and their performance are compared under various channels conditions. To facilitate comparison studies, results for the statistics of instantaneous combined signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) are derived, which can be applied for different fading conditions of interfering signals. The statistics for combined SNR and combined SINR are then used to quantify various performance measures, considering the impact of non-ideal estimation of the desired user channel state information (CSI) and the randomness in the number of active interferers.

This design problem was usually investigated in the literature by assuming that each user treats the co-channel interference from all the other users as additional noise at the receiver and, accordingly, the conventional single-user decoder (SUD) is applied. This paper considers a more advanced decoder design approach for decentralized MU-MIMO systems, in which each user opportunistically cancels the co-channel interference from certain subset of coexisting users when their signals are jointly decodable with the desired signal at the receiver. The new decoding scheme is thus termed opportunistic multiuser detection (OMD). This paper derives the optimal transmit covariance matrix for users' iterative maximization of individual transmit rates with the proposed OMD at the receiver, and evaluates the achievable throughput gains for decentralized MU-MIMO systems against the conventional SUD. Promising applications of the OMD for achieving maximum interference mitigation gains in spectrum sharing based wireless systems such as cognitive radio networks and cellular networks are demonstrated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5985568/05910120.pdf","startPage":"2474","endPage":"2485","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.060811.090721","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.060811.090721","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5985568","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5910120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Opportunistic Multiuser Detection in Decentralized Multiuser MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","MIMO","Covariance matrix","Multiuser detection","Interference","Decoding","Iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","covariance matrices","iterative methods","MIMO communication","multiuser detection","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic multiuser detection","decentralized multiuser MIMO system","decentralized multiuser multi-antenna system","multiple-input-multiple-output system","wireless spectrum sharing","frequency band","covariance matrices","transmit-rate maximization","cochannel interference","single-user decoder","decentralized MU-MIMO system","decoding scheme","iterative maximization","spectrum sharing based wireless system","cognitive radio network","cellular network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO interference channel","multiuser detection","spectrum sharing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5910120/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Opportunistic Multiuser Detection in Decentralized Multiuser MIMO Systems","volume":"10","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5910120/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12213440","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Opportunistic Multiuser Detection in Decentralized Multiuser MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"2474-tw1108-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086729S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5985568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5985568","articleId":"5910120","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5910121,"authors":[{"name":"Abdulla Firag","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5985568/5910121/5910121-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Abdulla Firag (M'09) is a Research Associate with the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering\u2019 University of Canterbury, New Zealand.

We derive the joint distribution function of two correlated quadratic forms and employ the result to obtain expressions for the cumulative distribution function, probability density function, moment generating function and moments of the signal-to-noise ratio. Using these expressions, we investigate the exact SER applicable for a large number of modulation schemes, outage probability and the ergodic capacity of the system. The results show that the average SER performance is sensitive to both feedback delay, channel estimation and spatial correlation at the transmitter. Furthermore, feedback delay causes an error floor and has the most degrading impact on performance.

In the proposed MF-SIC algorithm with shadow area constraints (SAC), an enhanced interference cancellation is achieved by introducing {constellation points as the candidates} to combat the error propagation in decision feedback loops. We also combine the MF-SIC with multi-branch (MB) processing, which achieves a higher detection diversity order. For coded systems, a low-complexity soft-input soft-output (SISO) iterative (turbo) detector is proposed based on the MF and the MB-MF interference suppression techniques. The computational complexity of the MF-SIC is comparable to the conventional SIC algorithm since very little additional complexity is required. Simulation results show that the algorithms significantly outperform the conventional SIC scheme and approach the optimal detector.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5985568/05910122.pdf","startPage":"2434","endPage":"2439","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.060811.101962","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.060811.101962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5985568","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5910122","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple Feedback Successive Interference Cancellation Detection for Multiuser MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon carbide","Detectors","Complexity theory","Decoding","Interference cancellation","Estimation","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","feedback","interference suppression","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple feedback successive interference cancellation detection","multiuser MIMO systems","low-complexity multiple feedback successive interference cancellation","MF-SIC strategy","multiuser multiple-input multiple-output systems","MU-MIMO systems","shadow area constraints","interference cancellation","decision feedback loops","error propagation","multibranch processing","soft-input soft-output iterative detector","computational complexity","MB-MF interference suppression techniques","maximum likelihood detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MU-MIMO systems","successive interference cancellation","feedback diversity","error propagation mitigation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5910122/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Feedback Successive Interference Cancellation Detection for Multiuser MIMO Systems","volume":"10","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5910122/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12205948","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Feedback Successive Interference Cancellation Detection for Multiuser MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"2434-tw1108-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076686S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5985568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5985568","articleId":"5910122","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5910123,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Hao Yu","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Networking, Aalto University, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5985568/5910123/5910123-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chia-Hao Yu received his B.Sc. degree and M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taiwan, in 2001 and 2003, respectively.

The system aims to optimize the throughput over the shared resources while fulfilling prioritized cellular service constraints. Optimum resource allocation and power control between the cellular and D2D connections that share the same resources are analyzed for different resource sharing modes. Optimality is discussed under practical constraints such as minimum and maximum spectral efficiency restrictions, and maximum transmit power or energy limitation. It is found that in most of the considered cases, optimum power control and resource allocation for the considered resource sharing modes can either be solved in closed form or searched from a finite set. The performance of the D2D underlay system is evaluated in both a single-cell scenario, and a Manhattan grid environment with multiple WINNER II A1 office buildings. The results show that by proper resource management, D2D communication can effectively improve the total throughput without generating harmful interference to cellular networks.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.060811.102120","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5985568/05910123.pdf","startPage":"2752","endPage":"2763","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.060811.102120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5985568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Sharing Optimization for Device-to-Device Communication Underlaying Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5910123","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5910123/","displayDocTitle":"Resource Sharing Optimization for Device-to-Device Communication Underlaying Cellular Networks","volume":"10","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12205949","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5910123/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Sharing Optimization for Device-to-Device Communication Underlaying Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"2752-tw1108-yu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132572S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5985568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"702","xplore-issue":"5985568","articleId":"5910123","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5910124,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5985568/5910124/5910124-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peng Xu obtained his B.Eng. degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from University of Science and Technology of China in 2009.

The diversity-multiplexing tradeoff will be used as the criterion for performance evaluation. In this paper, we propose two new half-duplex decode-forward cooperative transmission protocols, whose performance can approach the optimal MISO bound, and achieve a better diversity-multiplexing tradeoff when compared with existing cooperative protocols, particularly for large multiplexing gains. Firstly, a simple protocol of cooperative transmission is devised by combining opportunistic strategies with non-orthogonal transmission. When the number of relays is large, the proposed opportunistic decode-forward cooperative protocol can approach the optimal MISO upper bound. Due to the inter-relay interference constraint, each relay can only be used once, which limits the achievable diversity gain. Such an observation motivates our second transmission protocol which can further push the performance of cooperative transmission close to the optimal upper bound.

Usually adaptive approaches are carried out to mitigate them. Since the channel is very slowly time-varying, we propose to combat these impairements by using block-wise methods. Therefore, we introduce two new algorithms: the first one is a block-wise version of blind time equalizer (such as CMA), and the second one estimates the frequency offset in block-wise way. These algorithms are suitable for PSK and QAM constellations. By simulation investigations, we show that they outperform the standard approach in terms of convergence speed only at a moderate expense of computational load. We also experimentally evaluate their performance using 8-PSK real data traces and off-line processing which takes into account other physical impairments such as phase noise and non-linear effects.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2011.2160251","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6029401/05910127.pdf","startPage":"3070","endPage":"3082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2011.2160251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6029401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block-Wise Digital Signal Processing for PolMux QAM/PSK Optical Coherent Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5910127","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.15,  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5910127/","displayDocTitle":"Block-Wise Digital Signal Processing for PolMux QAM/PSK Optical Coherent Systems","volume":"29","issue":"20","publicationDate":"Oct.15, 2011","accessionNumber":"12267628","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5910127/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block-Wise Digital Signal Processing for PolMux QAM/PSK Optical Coherent Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-selmi-2160251-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12726S","chronDate":"Oct.15,  2011","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6029401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6029401","articleId":"5910127","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5910132,"authors":[{"name":"Giuseppe Papotto","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica Elettronica e dei Sistemi, Facolt\u00e0 di Ingegneria, Universit\u00e0 di Catania, Catania, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5995181/5910132/5910132-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Giuseppe Papotto received the Laurea degree in electronics engineering from the University of Catania, Catania, Italy, in 2007.

According to the proposed methodology, a 915-MHz harvester comprising an integrated input matching network and a 17-stage self-compensated rectifier has been designed and fabricated in a 90-nm CMOS technology. The rectifier exhibits a remarkably low input power threshold, as it is able to deliver a 1-V dc output voltage to a capacitive load with a very small input power of -24 dBm (4 \u03bcW). When driving a 1-M\u03a9 load, the device can supply a 1.2-V output with an input power of -18.8 dBm (13.1 \u03bcW).

In particular, inertial sensor-based locating systems are often supplemented with radio signals to improve localization accuracy. A radio-assisted localization system is still costly due to the infrastructure requirements and management overheads. In this paper, we propose a low-cost and yet accurate indoor pedestrian localization scheme with a small number of radio beacons whose location information is unknown. Our scheme applies the Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM) technique used in robotics to mobile device, which is equipped with both inertial sensors and the IEEE802.15.4a Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) radio, to obtain accurate locations of pedestrians in indoor environment. The proposed system is validated with real implementations.

This allowed us to obtain less than 1 dB penalty for amplification of 26 dense wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) channels modulated at 43.7 Gb/s return to zero-differential phase-shift keying, with the OPA placed between transmitter and receiver. We then used the same OPA in several different roles for a long-haul transmission system. We did not insert the OPA within the loop, but investigated this role indirectly by using equivalent results for small numbers of loop recirculations. We found that standard erbium-doped fiber amplifiers currently hold an advantage over this OPA, which becomes negligible for long distances. This paper shows that at this time OPAs can handle amplification of WDM traffic in excess of 1 Tb/s with little degradation. It also indicates that with further improvements, fiber OPAs could be a contender for wideband amplification in future optical communication networks.","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2011.2160155","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/6158729/05910348.pdf","startPage":"950","endPage":"957","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2011.2160155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6158729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fiber Optical Parametric Amplifier Performance in a 1-Tb/s DWDM Communication System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5910348","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5910348/","displayDocTitle":"Fiber Optical Parametric Amplifier Performance in a 1-Tb/s DWDM Communication System","volume":"18","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March-April 2012","accessionNumber":"12577114","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5910348/","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fiber Optical Parametric Amplifier Performance in a 1-Tb/s DWDM Communication System","sourcePdf":"jstqe-marhic-2160155-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073671S","chronDate":"March-April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"6158729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6158729","articleId":"5910348","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5910350,"authors":[{"name":"Zvika Ben-Haim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/5983457/5910350/5910350-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zvika Ben-Haim received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering and the B.A. degree in physics in 2000, the M.Sc. in electrical engineering in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering in 2010, all from the Technion\u2014Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.","From 2000 to 2006, he served as a Researcher in the Israel Defense Forces.

In particular, block sparse versions of the orthogonal matching pursuit and thresholding algorithms are analyzed under both adversarial and Gaussian noise models. In the adversarial setting, it is shown that estimation accuracy comes within a constant factor of the noise power. Under Gaussian noise, the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound is derived, and it is shown that the greedy techniques come close to this bound at high signal-to-noise ratio. The guarantees are numerically compared with the actual performance of block and non-block algorithms, identifying situations in which block sparse techniques improve upon the scalar sparsity approach. Specifically, we show that block sparse methods are particularly successful when the atoms within each block are nearly orthogonal.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2160250","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/5983457/05910350.pdf","startPage":"1032","endPage":"1047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2160250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5983457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-Oracle Performance of Greedy Block-Sparse Estimation Techniques From Noisy Measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5910350","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5910350/","displayDocTitle":"Near-Oracle Performance of Greedy Block-Sparse Estimation Techniques From Noisy Measurements","volume":"5","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12205882","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5910350/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-Oracle Performance of Greedy Block-Sparse Estimation Techniques From Noisy Measurements","sourcePdf":"jstsp-benhaim-2160250-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092685S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"5983457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5983457","articleId":"5910350","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5910354,"authors":[{"name":"Man Ju Seok","affiliation":["Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Man Ju","lastName":"Seok","id":"37717772400"},{"name":"Min Hyuk Choi","affiliation":["Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Min Hyuk","lastName":"Choi","id":"38259174100"},{"name":"Mallory Mativenga","affiliation":["Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Mallory","lastName":"Mativenga","id":"37714186500"},{"name":"Di Geng","affiliation":["Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Di","lastName":"Geng","id":"37719068400"},{"name":"Deok Yeol Kim","affiliation":["Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Deok Yeol","lastName":"Kim","id":"37068076000"},{"name":"Jin Jang","affiliation":["Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Jang","id":"37287784400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"5910354","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":83,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2963},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thin film transistors","Inverters","Logic gates","Threshold voltage","Electrodes","Fabrication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium compounds","indium compounds","invertors","thin film transistors","zinc compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["a-IGZO TFT-based inverter","top-gate-bias-induced depletion load","single-gated driving","dual-gated load","amorphous-indium-gallium-zinc-oxide","thin-film transistors","depletion mode","InGaZnO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amorphous-indium\u2013gallium\u2013zinc\u2013oxide (a-IGZO)","depletion load","inverter","thin-film transistor (TFT)"]}],"abstract":"A high-performance inverter implemented with single-gated driving and dual-gated load amorphous-indium-gallium-zinc-oxide thin-film transistors (TFTs) is demonstrated.

From our calculation, this circuit structure possesses low ohmic losses and reflection and can be applied to produce terahertz waves ranging from 0.2 to 0.25 THz with several hundreds of watts. Moreover, the maximum gain and interaction efficiency may reach 37.7 dB and 9.6%, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5910356/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"32","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12136029","htmlLink":"/document/5910356/","displayDocTitle":"Sine Waveguide for 0.22-THz Traveling-Wave Tube","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sine Waveguide for 0.22-THz Traveling-Wave Tube","sourcePdf":"led-wei-2158060-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075045S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"5961166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"5961166","articleId":"5910356","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5910366,"authors":[{"name":"Yujie Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/5958773/5910366/5910366-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yujie Song received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of South Carolina, Columbia, in 2005, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Shandong University, Jinan, China, in 1999.","Her current research interests include alternative power generation, artificial intelligence based applications in electrochemical energy components, and advanced motor control."]},"firstName":"Yujie","lastName":"Song","id":"37423703200"},{"name":"Lijun Gao","affiliation":["Boeing Research and Technology, Boeing Aerospace Company, Seattle, WA, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/5958773/5910366/5910366-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Lijun Gao (M'04\u2013SM'08) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of South Carolina, Columbia, in 2003.","He joined Boeing Company, Seattle, WA, in 2008.

A lithium battery model, which has three resolutions, is developed to depict the modeling approach. By combining the advantages of dyadic activation functions and the orthonormal property of wavelet functions, the developed battery model possesses two salient features. First, the model is built from a coarser approximation to a finer representation by adding more details incrementally. Second, the model at a low resolution is compatible with the model at a high resolution, which means that the parameters used in a low resolution can be directly incorporated into a high resolution without any modification. This paper's results show that this battery modeling provides great flexibility for users to choose a suitable resolution to meet their requirements for model accuracy and model execution speed.","doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2011.2144983","startPage":"1075","endPage":"1081","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503870/5958773/05910366.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2011.2144983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5958773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incremental Battery Model Using Wavelet-Based Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Batteries","Silicon","Training","Function approximation","Accuracy","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lithium","neural nets","power engineering computing","secondary cells","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["incremental battery model","wavelet-based neural network","dyadic activation functions","coarser approximation","multiresolution modeling approach","Li"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Battery modeling","incremental modeling","multi-resolution","neural networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5910366/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"Incremental Battery Model Using Wavelet-Based Neural Networks","volume":"1","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5910366/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12175057","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incremental Battery Model Using Wavelet-Based Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-song-2144983-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059587S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"5958773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5958773","articleId":"5910366","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5910375,"authors":[{"name":"Gilson I.

This paper covers theoretical analysis, Monte Carlo simulation, and experimental investigation of the charge trapping component of BTI. An analytical model for both stress and recovery phases of BTI is presented. Furthermore, the model properly describes device behavior under periodic switching, also called AC-BTI or cyclostationary operation. The model is based on microscopic device physics parameters, which are shown to cause statistical variation in transistor BTI behavior. It is shown that a universal logarithmic law describes the time dependence of charge trapping in both stress and recovery phases, and that the time dependence may be separated from the temperature and bias point dependence. Analytical equations for the statistical parameters are provided. The model is compared with experimental data and Monte Carlo simulation results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5910375/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","volume":"58","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"12120802","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5910375/","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Model for MOSFET Bias Temperature Instability Component Due to Charge Trapping","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Model for MOSFET Bias Temperature Instability Component Due to Charge Trapping","sourcePdf":"ted-wirth-2157828-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079514S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5959271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"5959271","articleId":"5910375","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5910378,"authors":[{"name":"Thang N.

The proposed CCPSO2 builds on the success of an early CCPSO that employs an effective variable grouping technique random grouping. CCPSO2 adopts a new PSO position update rule that relies on Cauchy and Gaussian distributions to sample new points in the search space, and a scheme to dynamically determine the coevolving subcomponent sizes of the variables. On high-dimensional problems (ranging from 100 to 2000 variables), the performance of CCPSO2 compared favorably against a state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm sep-CMA-ES, two existing PSO algorithms, and a cooperative coevolving differential evolution algorithm. In particular, CCPSO2 performed significantly better than sep-CMA-ES and two existing PSO algorithms on more complex multimodal problems (which more closely resemble real-world problems), though not as well as the existing algorithms on unimodal functions. Our experimental results and analysis suggest that CCPSO2 is a highly competitive optimization algorithm for solving large-scale and complex multimodal optimization problems.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2011.2112662","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2011.2112662","startPage":"210","endPage":"224","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/6176231/05910380.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6176231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperatively Coevolving Particle Swarms for Large Scale Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5910380/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Cooperatively Coevolving Particle Swarms for Large Scale Optimization","volume":"16","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","accessionNumber":"12638454","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5910380/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Cooperatively Coevolving Particle Swarms for Large Scale Optimization","sourcePdf":"tevc-li-2112662-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135506S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"6176231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"411","xplore-issue":"6176231","articleId":"5910380","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5910404,"authors":[{"name":"Naoki Shirai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoki","lastName":"Shirai","id":"37721278500"},{"name":"Satoshi Uchida","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Uchida","id":"37396799900"},{"name":"Fumiyoshi Tochikubo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Fumiyoshi","lastName":"Tochikubo","id":"37568415400"},{"name":"Shozo Ishii","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shozo","lastName":"Ishii","id":"37286678800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0093-3813"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9375"}],"articleNumber":"5910404","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":405},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5910404","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Anodes","Pattern formation","Discharges","Glow discharges","Helium","Metals","Conductivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anodes","glow discharges","pattern formation","plasma diagnostics","plasma pressure","plasma sources","plasma transport processes","self-adjusting systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self organized anode pattern","liquid anode surface","metal anode surface","atmospheric DC glow discharges","pattern formation","electrode gap length","helium flow rate","discharge current","anode luminous spot","self organized patterns","liquid conductivity","pressure 1 atm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Atmospheric dc glow discharge","liquid electrode discharge","self-organization"]}],"abstract":"Self-organized anode patterns were observed on the surface of a liquid or metal anode when an atmospheric dc glow discharge with helium flow was generated.

The impact of physical layer parameters such as the GOOC cross-correlation value and the OPPM overlapping index on key performance benchmarks such as network throughput and delay are analyzed. We also study the stability of the network based on the number of backlogged users, using the expected state drift. It has been shown that using GOOC instead of strict optical orthogonal codes improves the network average delay and throughput. Moreover, by comparing M-ary OPPM and conventional OOK signaling with a fair criterion we have demonstrated that OPPM signaling can substantially improve both steady state and transient network characteristics. This improvement can be obtained without introducing additional complexity in the receiver and transmitter structure.","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.3.000568","publicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563700/6016521/05910463.pdf","startPage":"568","endPage":"576","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.3.000568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6016521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Slotted ALOHA Random Access Packet-Switching Optical CDMA Networks Using Generalized Optical Orthogonal Codes and M-ary Overlapping PPM Signaling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5910463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5910463/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Slotted ALOHA Random Access Packet-Switching Optical CDMA Networks Using Generalized Optical Orthogonal Codes and M-ary Overlapping PPM Signaling","volume":"3","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12227826","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5910463/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Slotted ALOHA Random Access Packet-Switching Optical CDMA Networks Using Generalized Optical Orthogonal Codes and M-ary Overlapping PPM Signaling","sourcePdf":"568.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114618S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4563700","isNumber":"6016521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6016521","articleId":"5910463","onlineDate":"23 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":5910464,"authors":[{"name":"Halina Kwasnicka","affiliation":["Wroclaw University of Technology, Wroclaw, Poland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/6044604/5910464/5910464-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Halina Kwasnicka received the D.Sc. degree in 2000.","She is currently a Professor of computer science, the Head of Artificial Intelligence Division, and the Deputy Director for Scientific Research of the Institute of Informatics, Wroclaw University of Technology, Wroclaw, Poland.

We show that recorded neuronal signals represent convoluted mixtures, and we present a BSS algorithm. The algorithm uses the nonlinear energy operator as preprocessor and an extended method of independent-component analysis to separate convoluted mixtures. The algorithm is applied to recordings from retinal ganglion cells, and its performance is evaluated.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 5th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5773344/5910465/05910476.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2011 5th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering","doi":"10.1109/NER.2011.5910476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NER.2011.5910476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5910465","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5910476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind source separation for spike sorting of high density microelectrode array recordings","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Electrodes","Signal to noise ratio","Sorting","Timing","Integrated circuits","Retina"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arrays","biomedical electrodes","blind source separation","cellular biophysics","convolution","independent component analysis","medical signal processing","microelectrodes","neurophysiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","spike sorting","high density microelectrode array recordings","HD-MEA","densely packed electrodes","BSS algorithm","nonlinear energy operator","independent-component analysis","convoluted mixtures","retinal ganglion cells"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5910476/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 27 2011-May 1 2011","displayDocTitle":"Blind source separation for spike sorting of high density microelectrode array recordings","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5910476/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12073755","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","conferenceDate":"27 April-1 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind source separation for spike sorting of high density microelectrode array recordings","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"0020031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045611S","chronDate":"April 27 2011-May 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5773344","isNumber":"5910465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5773344","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5910465","articleId":"5910476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"M Akay and K.

A major impediment in this development is practical realization of complex conductance-based models of biophysical neural and synaptic dynamics in nanoscale electronics. Here we present such highly compact and low-power realizations, where each conductance is implemented using a single MOS transistor operating in subthreshold. Three alternative realizations are shown, implementing log-domain transformations of the conductance-based dynamics using translinear current scaling, capacitance scaling, and voltage scaling. Transistor level simulations validate the linearity of single transistor neural and synaptic conductance-capacitance dynamics in a 90nm CMOS process.","doi":"10.1109/NER.2011.5910490","publicationTitle":"2011 5th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 5th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5773344/5910465/05910490.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NER.2011.5910490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5910465","startPage":"68","endPage":"71","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subthreshold MOS dynamic translinear neural and synaptic conductance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5910490","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Subthreshold MOS dynamic translinear neural and synaptic conductance","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 27 2011-May 1 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5910490/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27 April-1 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12073769","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5910490/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subthreshold MOS dynamic translinear neural and synaptic conductance","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"0160175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057617S","chronDate":"April 27 2011-May 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5773344","isNumber":"5910465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5773344","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5910465","articleId":"5910490","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"M Akay and K.

A 1,600-neuron version of this network was within 0.27%, and run in real-time on a 3GHz PC. These results demonstrate that a SNN can implement a statistical signal processing algorithm widely used as the decoder in high-performance neural prostheses (Kalman filter), and achieve similar results with just a few thousand neurons.

Some methods have been proposed in the literature to determine the minimum break point set (MBPS) before the coordination procedure. In this paper, a new method is presented which coordinates overcurrent relays and simultaneously determines minimum unsatisfied constraints as broken constraints (BCs). For the implementation of this method, a new objective function (OF) is defined that also includes constraints with various weightings. These weightings determine the priority of constraints for being satisfied which are obtained by means of some expert rules. The expert rules of previous papers are modified and weighted to determine the priority of constraints. The genetic algorithm is used to optimize the OF that has an internal feedback for determining the minimum BCs considering coordination criterion. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is demonstrated by comparing the results of two sample networks with those obtained by using the recently developed techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2123117","startPage":"1927","endPage":"1938","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5910683/05910691.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2123117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5910683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overcurrent Relays Coordination Considering the Priority of Constraints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmission line matrix methods","Fault currents","Protective relaying","Circuit breakers","Optimization","Generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","overcurrent protection","relay protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["overcurrent relay coordination","constraint priority","interconnected networks","minimum break point set","overcurrent relays","genetic algorithm","MBPS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coordination","minimum break point set (MBPS)","protection","protective relaying","relay settings"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5910691/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"Overcurrent Relays Coordination Considering the Priority of Constraints","volume":"26","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5910691/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12073167","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overcurrent Relays Coordination Considering the Priority of Constraints","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-askarianabyaneh-2123117-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124084S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5910683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"5910683","articleId":"5910691","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5910701,"authors":[{"name":"Tetsuya Yamamoto","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Communication Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuya","lastName":"Yamamoto","id":"37538814400"},{"name":"Kazuki Takeda","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Communication Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuki","lastName":"Takeda","id":"37395678500"},{"name":"Fumiyuki Adachi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Communication Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Fumiyuki","lastName":"Adachi","id":"37280708600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-887-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-885-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-886-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5910701","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Frequency domain analysis","Multiplexing","Matrix decomposition","MIMO","Discrete Fourier transforms","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HARQ throughput enhancement","maximum likelihood block detection","recursive QR packet","M-algorithm","single-carrier MIMO","multiinput multioutput spatial multiplexing","hybrid automatic repeat request","bit-level log likelihood ratio packet combining","frequency-domain detection","minimum mean square error criterion","MMSED"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SC","MIMO","HARQ","QR decomposition","M-algorithm"]}],"abstract":"For achieving very high-speed and high quality packet transmission, the joint use of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) spatial multiplexing and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) is very effective.

Therefore, we have to implement Detect-And-Avoid (DAA) techniques to detect the primary system and control the signal transmitted from the UWB devices. Although there is the energy detection scheme for detecting the primary signal based on a threshold, it is difficult to find an appropriate threshold. In this paper, we investigate a novel detection scheme for UWB Multi-Band OFDM system. The proposed method detects the presence of the primary system using estimates of the primary signal and the noise variance based on the maximum likelihood criterion. Moreover, we introduce Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) in order to select the most suitable primary signal model out of some possible models. As a result, the proposed method dynamically find the threshold to detect the presence of the primary signal in sharp contrast to the conventional energy detection method which uses a static threshold. By the computer simulations, we show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional method with respect to missed-detection and false-detection probabilities.","doi":"10.1109/MC-SS.2011.5910703","publicationTitle":"2011 8th International Workshop on Multi-Carrier Systems & Solutions","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 8th International Workshop on Multi-Carrier Systems & Solutions","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783417/5910698/05910703.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MC-SS.2011.5910703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5910698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study on interference detection scheme using AIC for UWB MB-OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5910703","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5910703/","displayDocTitle":"A study on interference detection scheme using AIC for UWB MB-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12073927","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5910703/","conferenceDate":"3-4 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study on interference detection scheme using AIC for UWB MB-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Herrsching, Germany","sourcePdf":"03AStudyonInterferenceDetectionSchemeusingAIC.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084282S","chronDate":"3-4 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783417","isNumber":"5910698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783417","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5910698","articleId":"5910703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5910705,"authors":[{"name":"Yoko Masuda","affiliation":["Department of Applied Electronics, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoko","lastName":"Masuda","id":"37717930800"},{"name":"Kohei Ohno","affiliation":["Department of Applied Electronics, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Kohei","lastName":"Ohno","id":"37264993800"},{"name":"Makoto Itami","affiliation":["Department of Applied Electronics, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Itami","id":"37284644000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-887-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-885-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-886-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5910705","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Signal to noise ratio","Additive noise","Receivers","Shape","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative detection","precoded OFDM","frequency domain","precoding data symbols","signal-to-noise ratio","additive noise","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]}],"abstract":"The performance of OFDM is improved by pre-coding data symbols in the frequency domain.

Unlike related work where the design of the MU-MIMO component is jointly performed with the subcarrier allocation among the users (e.g. some form of OFDMA is present), here it is assumed that the selected users will have to share the utilization of all the subcarriers in the system. This scenario would be typical of deployments based on time multiplexing policies (e.g., WLANs) where the proposed MU-MIMO add-on would serve to increase the system capacity. A new algorithm is introduced to select the users taking into account their channel response over all subcarriers and performing a joint frequency-space power allocation. Numerical results demonstrate very significant improvements in terms of sum-rate capacity in comparison to a conventional (opportunistic) TDMA scheme.","doi":"10.1109/MC-SS.2011.5910709","publicationTitle":"2011 8th International Workshop on Multi-Carrier Systems & Solutions","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 8th International Workshop on Multi-Carrier Systems & Solutions","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783417/5910698/05910709.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MC-SS.2011.5910709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5910698","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic multiuser MIMO for OFDM networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5910709","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic multiuser MIMO for OFDM networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5910709/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-4 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12073933","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5910709/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic multiuser MIMO for OFDM networks","confLoc":"Herrsching, Germany","sourcePdf":"09OpportunisticMultiuserMIMOforOFDMNetworks.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058931S","chronDate":"3-4 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783417","isNumber":"5910698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783417","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5910698","articleId":"5910709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5910710,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyi Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Xiaoyi","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37536984800"},{"name":"Angela Doufexi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Angela","lastName":"Doufexi","id":"37276844100"},{"name":"Taskin Kocak","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Bahcesehir University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Taskin","lastName":"Kocak","id":"38266211600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-887-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-885-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-886-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5910710","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1382},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Signal to noise ratio","Throughput","Antennas","OFDM","Bit error rate","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","error statistics","OFDM modulation","personal area networks","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beamforming performance analysis","OFDM based IEEE 802.11ad","millimeter-wave WPAN","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","wireless personal area networks","symbol-wise beamforming","subcarrier-wise beamforming","hybrid beamforming","bit error rate","BER performance","frequency 60 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WPAN","60 GHz","IEEE 802.11ad","OFDM","Beamforming","Codebook"]}],"abstract":"This paper exploits the performance of three types of beamforming techniques over the 60 GHz orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based wireless personal area networks (WPANs).

Then, an adaptive HARQ strategy is formulated whose aim is maximizing the goodput (GP) metric, i.e., the number of error-free information bits delivered to the user by unit of time, over the coding rate, the bit distribution and an on-off power allocation across the active subchannels.

Large distances between the base stations result in unavoidable differences in time of arrival between the users' signals which in turn lead to inter-symbol interference in OFDM systems if the cyclic prefix length is exceeded. Moreover, carrier frequency offsets which are caused by imperfect oscillators lead to inter-carrier interference and are in particular a problem in the downlink due to the feedback delay of the measured channel state information. In this paper we derive metrics for evaluating the impact of time and frequency asynchronisms in CoMP systems with large base station distances. We compare performance results for CoMP and single user transmission techniques in a selected transmission scenario where we use a 3GPP/LTE baseline system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 8th International Workshop on Multi-Carrier Systems & Solutions","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783417/5910698/05910719.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2011 8th International Workshop on Multi-Carrier Systems & Solutions","doi":"10.1109/MC-SS.2011.5910719","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MC-SS.2011.5910719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5910698","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5910719","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On synchronization requirements and performance limitations for CoMP systems in large cells","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","OFDM","Base stations","Joints","Receivers","Signal to noise ratio","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","intercarrier interference","intersymbol interference","Long Term Evolution","OFDM modulation","synchronisation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronization requirements","CoMP systems","base stations","intersymbol interference","OFDM systems","intercarrier interference","imperfect oscillators","feedback delay","channel state information","frequency asynchronisms","coordinated multipoint systems","3GPP-LTE baseline system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5910719/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"On synchronization requirements and performance limitations for CoMP systems in large cells","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5910719/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12073941","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","conferenceDate":"3-4 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On synchronization requirements and performance limitations for CoMP systems in large cells","confLoc":"Herrsching, Germany","sourcePdf":"17OnSynchronizationRequirementsandPerformance.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085784S","chronDate":"3-4 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783417","isNumber":"5910698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783417","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5910698","articleId":"5910719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5910720,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Sanguinetti","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Sanguinetti","id":"37269450000"},{"name":"Michele Morelli","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Morelli","id":"37273534500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-887-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-885-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-886-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5910720","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":202},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distance measurement","Timing","IEEE 802.16 Standards","OFDM","Tiles","Discrete Fourier transforms","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjacent channel interference","error statistics","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","synchronisation","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE 802.16 based OFDMA system","IEEE 802.16 standard","nomadic wireless metropolitan area network","orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access","timing error","uplink signal","base station","interchannel interference","multiple-access interference","error-rate performance","ranging scheme","uplink synchronization","multipath distortion"]}],"abstract":"The IEEE 802.16 family of standards for nomadic wireless metropolitan area networks adopts orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access as an air interface.

First, an analytical characterization of the nonlinear distortion effects caused by the amplifier on bandlimited BIC-OFDM signals is carried out by resorting to the extended version of the Bussgang theorem. Then, the equivalent additive noise model provided by the Bussgang-based analysis is taken into account in the derivation of a novel link quality prediction method, named B\u03baESM. Finally, the novel B\u03baESM tool is employed in the link design phase for choosing the best amplifier setting, aimed at maximizing the layer-3 offered traffic over a realistic wireless channel, featuring both multipath propagation and nonlinear distortions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A performance prediction model for BIC-OFDM transmissions with AMC over nonlinear fading channels","publicationTitle":"2011 8th International Workshop on Multi-Carrier Systems & Solutions","doi":"10.1109/MC-SS.2011.5910726","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 8th International Workshop on Multi-Carrier Systems & Solutions","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783417/5910698/05910726.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MC-SS.2011.5910726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5910698","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5910726","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5910726/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"A performance prediction model for BIC-OFDM transmissions with AMC over nonlinear fading channels","conferenceDate":"3-4 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5910726/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12073948","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A performance prediction model for BIC-OFDM transmissions with AMC over nonlinear fading channels","confLoc":"Herrsching, Germany","sourcePdf":"24APerformancePredictionModelforBICOFDMTransm.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058615S","chronDate":"3-4 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783417","isNumber":"5910698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783417","xplore-issue":"5910698","articleId":"5910726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5910727,"authors":[{"name":"Carsten Bockelmann","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Brethemen, Germany"],"firstName":"Carsten","lastName":"Bockelmann","id":"37568999500"},{"name":"Dirk W\u00fcbben","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Brethemen, Germany"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"W\u00fcbben","id":"37269338400"},{"name":"Karl-Dirk Kammeyer","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Brethemen, Germany"],"firstName":"Karl-Dirk","lastName":"Kammeyer","id":"37270666500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-887-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-885-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-886-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5910727","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Loading","OFDM","Robustness","Modulation","Least squares approximation","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","data communication","Long Term Evolution","modulation coding","OFDM modulation","telecommunication links","telecommunication network reliability","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outage capacity","link adaptation","BICM-OFDM","imperfect CSI","wireless data transmission","channel code","LTE","turbo code","bit interleaved coded modulation","orthogonal frequency division multiplex"]}],"abstract":"Adapting the modulation, power and channel code to the current channel state for OFDM systems is an important topic for future wireless data transmission to fully utilize the given channel conditions.

In centralized coordinated transmission from a cluster of base stations, the channel state information (CSI) of users needs to be sent to a central processor for precoding and resource allocation. Real time CSI feedback from the users to their home base station and from the base stations to the central processor is a serious challenge from a practical point of view. A hybrid mode transmission scheme with reduced feedback requirement exploiting user location information and cell sectorization is proposed, in which some users are served using single-cell multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) approach and some using the network MIMO approach. Using a virtual MIMO downlink channel model the feedback requirement, complexity of user scheduling and precoding/power allocation with most multiuser MIMO precoding techniques is substantially reduced compared to the corresponding case using full CSI. Dirty paper coding (DPC) and zero forcing beamforming (ZFBF) precoding techniques are used to demonstrate the performance of the hybrid mode network MIMO technique.","doi":"10.1109/MC-SS.2011.5910731","publicationTitle":"2011 8th International Workshop on Multi-Carrier Systems & Solutions","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 8th International Workshop on Multi-Carrier Systems & Solutions","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783417/5910698/05910731.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MC-SS.2011.5910731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5910698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid mode user-location-aware network MIMO with limited feedback for cellular downlink","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5910731","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5910731/","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid mode user-location-aware network MIMO with limited feedback for cellular downlink","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12073953","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5910731/","conferenceDate":"3-4 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid mode user-location-aware network MIMO with limited feedback for cellular downlink","confLoc":"Herrsching, Germany","sourcePdf":"29AHybridModeUserLocationAwareNetworkMIMOwith.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060663S","chronDate":"3-4 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783417","isNumber":"5910698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783417","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5910698","articleId":"5910731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5910733,"authors":[{"name":"Charlotte Langlais","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Institut Telecom-Telecom Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Charlotte","lastName":"Langlais","id":"37281915300"},{"name":"Salim Haddad","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Institut Telecom-Telecom Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Salim","lastName":"Haddad","id":"37709563400"},{"name":"Yves Louet","affiliation":["IETR-SUPELEC, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Louet","id":"37571400800"},{"name":"Nejla Mazouz","affiliation":["IETR-SUPELEC, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Nejla","lastName":"Mazouz","id":"37706110900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-887-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-885-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-886-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5910733","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":292},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Bit error rate","Receivers","Parity check codes","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","forward error correction","iterative methods","OFDM modulation","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FEC codes","PAPR reduction","OFDM signals","peak to average power ratio reduction","signal to noise ratio","forward error correcting coded systems","BER performance","iterative clipping noise cancellation receiver","clipped LDPC coded OFDM system","genie aided performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PAPR","classification","OFDM","clipping","iterative cancellation","LDPC"]}],"abstract":"By virtue of its simplicity, clipping appears to be one of the most attractive methods to mitigate Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) in OFDM systems.

The technique is named uplink interference protection (ULIP). ULIP exploits existing reference signals transmitted by all base stations (BSs). The fact that path loss and lognormal shadowing can be considered reciprocal in such frequency-division duplex (FDD) systems is exploited. Therefore, no additional signalling is required for a new mobile station (MS) to estimate the level of inter-cell interference it would cause to ongoing uplink transmissions in neighbouring cells. Using the acquired knowledge, MSs can adjust their transmit power to ensure that existing links are not forced into outage. A scheduling scheme is suggested in which a fair allocation of priority resource blocks (RBs), based on user signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs), enhances both cell-edge throughput and user throughput fairness. Through this, also significant system throughput gains are generated. Finally, it is demonstrated that as a side effect of the interference reductions, considerable energy savings can be achieved.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uplink interference protection and fair scheduling for power efficient OFDMA networks","publicationTitle":"2011 8th International Workshop on Multi-Carrier Systems & Solutions","doi":"10.1109/MC-SS.2011.5910735","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 8th International Workshop on Multi-Carrier Systems & Solutions","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783417/5910698/05910735.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MC-SS.2011.5910735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5910698","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5910735","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5910735/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Uplink interference protection and fair scheduling for power efficient OFDMA networks","conferenceDate":"3-4 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5910735/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12073957","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink interference protection and fair scheduling for power efficient OFDMA networks","confLoc":"Herrsching, Germany","sourcePdf":"33UplinkInterferenceProtectionandFairScheduli.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079108S","chronDate":"3-4 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783417","isNumber":"5910698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783417","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5910698","articleId":"5910735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5910736,"authors":[{"name":"Guangxia Zhou","affiliation":["Intel Mobile Communications GmbH, Germany"],"firstName":"Guangxia","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38183038400"},{"name":"Gerhard Bauch","affiliation":["Institut for Information Processing, Universit\u00e4t der Bundeswehr Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Bauch","id":"37266555700"},{"name":"Jens Berkmann","affiliation":["Intel Mobile Communications GmbH, Germany"],"firstName":"Jens","lastName":"Berkmann","id":"37375105800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-887-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-885-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-886-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5910736","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"abstract":"In this paper, a downlink multi-cell orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access (OFDMA) system using the same carrier frequency is studied.

This will result in multiple access interference with the collapse of orthogonality among OFDMA subcarriers due to carrier frequency and timing offsets of IVC. This paper proposes a frequency sharing scheduling to suppress the interference to RVC by selecting subcarriers and controlling power properly during the period allocating the time slots and the subcarriers of OFDMA to multiple pairs of IVC and RVC, respectively.

Extensive simulations are carried out with LTE system compliance and results show the proposed scheduler effectively improves the system throughput up to a moderate resource utilization.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical resource scheduling and power control optimization for LTE femtocell networks","publicationTitle":"2011 8th International Workshop on Multi-Carrier Systems & Solutions","doi":"10.1109/MC-SS.2011.5910738","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 8th International Workshop on Multi-Carrier Systems & Solutions","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783417/5910698/05910738.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MC-SS.2011.5910738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5910698","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5910738","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5910738/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Practical resource scheduling and power control optimization for LTE femtocell networks","conferenceDate":"3-4 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5910738/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12073960","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical resource scheduling and power control optimization for LTE femtocell networks","confLoc":"Herrsching, Germany","sourcePdf":"36PracticalResourceSchedulingandPowerControlO.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049154S","chronDate":"3-4 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783417","isNumber":"5910698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783417","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5910698","articleId":"5910738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5914459,"authors":[{"name":"Yin Liu","affiliation":["School of Management, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Yin Liu","id":"37087397843"},{"name":"Liang Ma","affiliation":["School of Management, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Liang Ma","id":"37087332145"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-109-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-108-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-107-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5914459","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Optimization","Shape","Computational modeling","Convergence","Artificial neural networks","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","particle swarm optimisation","travelling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TSP","fuzzy particle swarm algorithm","fuzzy rules","travelling salesman problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Traveling salesman problem","Fuzzy rules","Particle swarm algorithm","Fuzzy particle swarm algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5914459","abstract":"Fuzzy particle swarm algorithm is a novel optimization method for solving real problems by using both the fuzzy rules and the characteristics of particle swarm algorithm.

By controlling the array through a real-time optimization process, the adaptive techniques diminish the impact of system component noise and mitigate the effects of interfering radiation to ensure the delivery of a maximum fidelity signal. This paper deals with the possibilities to cancel unwanted signals by steering nulls of the pattern in the direction of high interference without affecting the main beam. We propose a null steering beamforming algorithm allowing us to suppress the interference based on the genetic algorithm (GA). The method used to calculate the position perturbations of selected elements is based on minimization of the power at the null locations and the power fluctuation in the main beam. The proposed null steering beamforming algorithm and the adaptive null steering method are compared with respect to the initial pattern using complex weights. We find that the proposed null steering beamforming algorithm possesses the better performance. Computer simulation shows the effectiveness of the proposed beamforming algorithm for wireless communication systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5915514/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12074990","htmlLink":"/document/5915514/","conferenceDate":"22-25 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Null steering beamforming for wireless communication system using genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Null steering beamforming for wireless communication system using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0087A3004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043138S","chronDate":"22-25 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5871807","isNumber":"5915149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5871807","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5915149","articleId":"5915514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5915517,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen''s Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Li","id":"37715797800"},{"name":"Imran Shoaib","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen''s Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Imran","lastName":"Shoaib","id":"37319039200"},{"name":"Shihua Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen''s Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Shihua","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406385300"},{"name":"Xiaodong Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen''s Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37278211900"},{"name":"Zhinong Ying","affiliation":["Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Zhinong","lastName":"Ying","id":"37305489700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8559-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8556-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8558-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5915517","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":743},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Antenna radiation patterns","MIMO","Channel capacity","Correlation","Microwave antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","channel capacity","dielectric resonator antennas","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern reconfigurable DRA array","MIMO communication system","dielectric resonator antenna","antenna array","radiation pattern reconfiguration","channel capacity","frequency 2.4 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dielectric resonator antenna (DRA)","reconfigurable","pattern reconfigurable","MIMO channel capacity"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents our study on the dielectric resonator antennas (DRA) to achieve pattern reconfigurability.

Moreover, it exhibits nearly omnidirectional radiation patterns and stable gain across the operating band.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compact band-notched UWB slot antenna optimized by genetic algorithm","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Microwave Technology & Computational Electromagnetics","doi":"10.1109/ICMTCE.2011.5915520","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Microwave Technology & Computational Electromagnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5871807/5915149/05915520.pdf","startPage":"313","endPage":"315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMTCE.2011.5915520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5915149","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5915520","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5915520/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"A compact band-notched UWB slot antenna optimized by genetic algorithm","conferenceDate":"22-25 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5915520/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12074996","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compact band-notched UWB slot antenna optimized by genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0093A21001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064622S","chronDate":"22-25 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5871807","isNumber":"5915149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5871807","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5915149","articleId":"5915520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5915529,"authors":[{"name":"Zhong-Bo Zhang","affiliation":["School of Science, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhong-Bo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37715574600"},{"name":"Li-Xin Guo","affiliation":["School of Science, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Li-Xin","lastName":"Guo","id":"37306671900"},{"name":"Zhong-Yu Liu","affiliation":["School of Science, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhong-Yu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37711254300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8559-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8556-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8558-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5915529","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diffraction","Reflection","Buildings","Loss measurement","Ray tracing","Electric fields","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microcellular radio","radiowave propagation","ray tracing","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reverse ray tracing","radio propagation prediction","tree-building process","RT algorithm","virtual source tree","urban microcell"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Path loss","Ray tracing","Urban microcell"]}],"abstract":"Recursive way is usually applied to Tree-building process for common ray tracing (RT) algorithm based on virtual source tree. Owing to limiting the maximum number of layer, this paper presents a new method to build tree layer by layer in cyclic way.

A comparison between the calculated and measured results is presented, which shows high predicting accuracy.

Then, based on the characteristics of hybrid models, the permittivity can be formulated by rational polynomial fraction in j \u03c9. The conversion equation from frequency-domain to time-domain and the shift operator method are then applied to obtain the constitutive relation at modified electrical points and the time-domain recursive formula for D and E.

The algorithm of parallel FDTD is a powerful tool for solving large electrical objects for its parallel nature. The Tianhe-1A supercomputer is the fastest one in the world at present, which can provide very high computational capability. An efficient FDTD simulator combined with the supercomputer is urgent for actual applications. We have developed a high performance parallel Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) algorithm based on the Tianhe-1A supercomputer. Our goal is to effectively solve the problems of complex structures and large electricity object. By using parallel computations, we are able to complete a calculation on 7200 processors in less than 48 hours, where a serial version would have taken over several decades.

The BMUD for STBC-OFDM system has been extensively studied in future communication systems. The proposed receivers implemented by linearly constrained minimum variance filters are designed to achieve this goal. However, the filter suffers from the heavy computational load and slow convergence speed. The proposed two-stage receiver contains adaptive BMUD then followed by a channel estimator and RAKE receiver. The two-stage receiver which uses the property of STBC to design receiver, reduces the bit-error-rate (BER) tremendously for the compared receivers. Finally, Computer simulations demonstrate that the proposed two-stage receiver has better performance than the traditional receiver with much lower computational load.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simplified blind multiuser receiver for OFDM system with space-time block codes","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Business Management and Electronic Information","doi":"10.1109/ICBMEI.2011.5917956","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Business Management and Electronic Information","pdfPath":"/iel5/5871804/5917827/05917956.pdf","startPage":"500","endPage":"502","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBMEI.2011.5917956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5917827","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5917956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5917956/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Simplified blind multiuser receiver for OFDM system with space-time block codes","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5917956/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12074614","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simplified blind multiuser receiver for OFDM system with space-time block codes","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"0337B1220361.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060868S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5871804","isNumber":"5917827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5871804","xplore-issue":"5917827","articleId":"5917956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5918003,"authors":[{"name":"Guoqi Zeng","affiliation":["UAV Research Academy, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guoqi","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37087881512"},{"name":"Zhang Feng","affiliation":["UAV Research Academy, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Feng","id":"37087827244"},{"name":"Siying Li","affiliation":["UAV Research Academy, Beijing Aeronautics and Astronautics University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Siying","lastName":"Li","id":"37087825057"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-109-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-108-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-107-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5918003","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5918003","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Extrapolation","Genetic algorithms","Current density","Frequency estimation","Moment methods","Time frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational electromagnetics","current density","genetic algorithms","method of moments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","frequency extrapolation method","multiple trace current density","MOM","method of moment","ESPRIT method","wide band scatting","optical function","paraboloid","electromagnetic wave incidence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Method of Moment","Frequency Extrapolation","Genetic Algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICBMEI.2011.5918003","pdfPath":"/iel5/5871804/5917827/05918003.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Business Management and Electronic Information","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Business Management and Electronic Information","startPage":"677","endPage":"680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5917827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBMEI.2011.5918003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The application of genetic algorithm on the frequency extrapolation method using current density from the MOM","abstract":"The multiple trace current density, from the result of MOM (Method of Moment), model varying with the frequency was created, ESPRIT method is used to evaluate the parameters of the model based the current densities at several frequency points, it is easy to obtain the more wide frequencies current density and it saves lots of time to calculate the wide band scatting; it is indicated that the extrapolation results agree with the results using the strict MOM when the extrapolation scope less than six, but the results become disperse when the extrapolation scope enlarge more, and extrapolation scope is not stable.
