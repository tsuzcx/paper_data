There are two ways to suppress the islanding phenomenon, one of them is performed on the utility side, the other one on the PV side. On the utility side the reactor insertion method and the capacitor insertion method are advocated. The islanding phenomenon suppression characteristics of these two methods are compared in tests. Further, it is proved that the process, leading to the suppression of islanding phenomena, can be described in general power supply theory.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCPEC.1994.520070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11458","startPage":"759","endPage":"762 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE 1st World Conference on Photovoltaic Energy Conversion - WCPEC (A Joint Conference of PVSC, PVSEC and PSEC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3971/11458/00520070.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Islanding phenomenon elimination study at Rokko test center","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/520070/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"Islanding phenomenon elimination study at Rokko test center","conferenceDate":"5-9 Dec. 1994","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5175970","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Islanding phenomenon elimination study at Rokko test center","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00520070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.019402S","chronDate":"5-9 Dec 1994","isNumber":"11458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3971","citationCount":"25","articleId":"520070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":520112,"authors":[{"name":"L.E. de Graaf","affiliation":["Ecofys Research and Consultancy, Utrecht, Netherlands"],"firstName":"L.E.","lastName":"de Graaf","id":"37348659400"},{"name":"T.C.J. van der Weiden","affiliation":["Ecofys Research and Consultancy, Utrecht, Netherlands"],"firstName":"T.C.J.","lastName":"van der Weiden","id":"37348657700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1460-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"520112","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Energy loss","Manufacturing","Prototypes","Monitoring","Thermal stresses","Insulation","Thermal loading","Power engineering and energy","Renewable energy resources"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["photovoltaic power systems","solar cell arrays","solar cells","invertors","DC-AC power convertors","losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["small grid connected PV-systems","AC-modules","inverter","reduced energy losses","mismatch","partial shading","Ecofys building roof","Utrecht","Netherlands","polycrystalline AC-modules","system efficiency","performance ratio","11 percent"]}],"abstract":"AC-modules are PV-panels with an inverter on the rear of the module.

One of the advantages is the possibility to realise small grid connected PV-systems, because each AC-module is an independent unit. Other important advantages are ease of engineering and reduced energy losses caused by mismatch and partial shading. On the roof of the Ecofys building in Utrecht (Netherlands), a pilot system consisting of 20 polycrystalline AC-modules was realized.

The parametric procedures such as the maximum likelihood classifier are statistically stable and robust. However they lack flexibility and and are incapable of making correct area estimates. On the other hand, nonparametric classifiers are generally very sensitive to distribution of anomalies and critically dependent on training sample size. These problems can be improved by providing prior probabilities derived from a non-parametric process in a conventional parametric classifier. In this paper, a method to merge the advantages of parametric and non-parametric strategies is presented by using Kohonen neural network and multilayer neural network with a backpropagation algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Jul1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/520304/","accessionNumber":"5106282","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-14 July 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Classification of multispectral image using neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of multispectral image using neural network","confLoc":"Firenze, Italy","sourcePdf":"00520304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052612S","chronDate":"10-14 Jul1995","isNumber":"11409","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3940","citationCount":"2","articleId":"520304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":520306,"authors":[{"name":"L.

This technique used the internal capacitance of a voltage op-amp to derive the filter transfer function, and showed potential advantages in terms of high-frequency performance and IC integration. However the main disadvantages of the technique were found to be the strong temperature-dependence of the filter centre-frequency, and the limited dynamic range due to op-amp slew rate limitations. By applying the active-R technique to current-feedback op-amps, it is found that these major disadvantages are overcome. Thus the active-R technique applied to current-feedback op-amps seems a very promising method for the implementation of high-frequency integrated analog filter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/520360/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 1995-May 3 1995","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 April-3 May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5112867","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The active-R filter technique applied to current-feedback op-amps","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The active-R filter technique applied to current-feedback op-amps","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00520360.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043461S","chronDate":"April 30 1995-May 3 1995","isNumber":"11413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3941","citationCount":"18","articleId":"520360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":520383,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This is due primarily to the use of more efficient training algorithms and better understanding of their capabilities and limitations. NNs have been found to be robust and well suited for the wide variety of data found in remote sensing. They are used in the classification of land-use as well as in the estimation of target properties. The type of neural network to use, the method of training, and the capabilities and limitations of the various neural networks are still the subject of some debate. This paper examines the performance of four neural network algorithms found in the literature: (1) the traditional multi-layer perceptron trained with the well known back-propagation algorithm of Werbos (1974) and Rumelhart and McClelland (1988) (BP-MLP), (2) the dynamic-learning NN (DLNN) of Tzeng et al. (1994) trained using a linear Kalman-based technique, (3) the fast learning NN (FL-MLP) of Manry et al.

Many embedded computing systems are distributed systems: communicating periodic processes executing on several CPUs/ASICs connected by communication links. We use performance estimates to compute a local sensitivity of the design to process allocation. We propose a priority prediction method to schedule processes. Based on these techniques, we develop a gradient-search algorithm which co-synthesizes heterogeneous distributed systems of arbitrary topology and the associated application software architecture.

Starting from the most promising circuit concepts and an adequate resistance level, the transistor geometries must be optimized very carefully using advanced transistor models. It is shown how the bond inductances can be favorably used and how the (critical) on-chip wiring must be taken into account. An inexpensive mounting technique proved to be well suited up to 50 Gb/s.

The asymmetric polyphase filter makes it possible to suppress the mirror signal not at HF, but after quadrature demodulation at a low IF. The most important parameters for the polyphase filter are a high dynamic range and a good mirror signal suppression. This paper reports on the realisation in a 1.2 /spl mu/m CMOS process of a 5th order Butterworth polyphase filter with a bandwidth of 220 kHz centered around 250 kHz. Its measured mirror signal suppression is 64 dB.

In the intended use, a received 160 kb/s binary-FSK signal is amplified at RF, directly downconverted to DC, and applied to the logarithmic amplifier after channel-select filtering. The amplifier provides two useful outputs. First, the limited output from the cascade of clipping amplifiers contains the data encoded as signal phase in the zero-crossings. Second, the circuit produces a logarithmic signal-strength measurement to an accuracy of 1 dB over a 80 dB dynamic range.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/520702/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5205424","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1995","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS limiting amplifier and signal-strength indicator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS limiting amplifier and signal-strength indicator","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"00520702.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062577S","chronDate":"8-10 June 1995","isNumber":"11535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4017","citationCount":"31","articleId":"520702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":520704,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A wider I/O DRAM is necessary to provide a sufficiently small granularity for the memory system. Hierarchical data-line architectures which transfer many bits over the memory array could potentially be used to provide a wide I/O. However, even using these schemes, chip size must expand to accommodate additional devices and wiring as the I/O width increases.

However, in the low-voltage and high-frequency domain this technique will see several crucial problems. Besides, the wide-frequency operation (e.g. an extended data output and a synchronous operation) and the variable-load current (e.g, a variable refresh cycle and a changeable data output) are required. This paper proposes VDC circuit techniques for the low-voltage (less than 2.5 V), wide-frequency, and the variable-load current. The mixed-mode VDC (MM-VDC) provides two-modes of current by the analog VDC (A-VDC) and the digital VDC (D-VDC) supply being suitable for the load current. It also reduces the current consumption in the VDC and guarantees stable operation. Moreover, the impedance adjustment circuitry (IAC) controls the current supply capability of the D-VDC according to the load operation frequency to minimize the bounce of the internal power supply level. The MM-VDC can be applicable to low-voltage wide-frequency DRAMs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/520710/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5212076","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1995","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"A mixed-mode voltage-down converter with impedance adjustment circuitry for low-voltage wide-frequency DRAMs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A mixed-mode voltage-down converter with impedance adjustment circuitry for low-voltage wide-frequency DRAMs","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"00520710.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061053S","chronDate":"8-10 June 1995","isNumber":"11535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4017","citationCount":"1","articleId":"520710","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":520711,"authors":[{"name":"Seung-Jun Lee","affiliation":["Hyundai Electronics, Inc., Ichon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seung-Jun Lee","id":"37087680716"},{"name":"Kee-Woo Park","affiliation":["Hyundai Electronics, Inc., Ichon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kee-Woo Park","id":"37088781320"},{"name":"Chang-Ho Chung","affiliation":["Hyundai Electronics, Inc., Ichon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Chang-Ho Chung","id":"37088776318"},{"name":"Jin-Seung Son","affiliation":["Hyundai Electronics, Inc., Ichon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jin-Seung Son","id":"37087589471"},{"name":"Ki-Hong Park","affiliation":["Hyundai Electronics, Inc., Ichon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ki-Hong Park","id":"37088788060"},{"name":"Sang-Ho Shin","affiliation":["Hyundai Electronics, Inc., Ichon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sang-Ho Shin","id":"37088776305"},{"name":"Seok-Tae Kim","affiliation":["Hyundai Electronics, Inc., Ichon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seok-Tae Kim","id":"37088778582"},{"name":"Jeong-Dong Han","affiliation":["Hyundai Electronics, Inc., Ichon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jeong-Dong Han","id":"37088782391"},{"name":"Hoi-Jun Yoo","affiliation":["Hyundai Electronics, Inc., Ichon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hoi-Jun Yoo","id":"37087160867"},{"name":"Wi-Sik Min","affiliation":["Hyundai Electronics, Inc., Ichon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Wi-Sik Min","id":"37087209814"},{"name":"Kye-Hwan Oh","affiliation":["Hyundai Electronics, Inc., Ichon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kye-Hwan Oh","id":"37087675756"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7800-2599-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"520711","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage","SDRAM","Counting circuits","Clocks","Frequency","Pulse amplifiers","Bandwidth","Surges","Wire","Artificial intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","integrated circuit noise","CMOS memory circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low noise dynamic RAM","synchronous DRAM","column-decoded I/O line","operating current reduction","high clock frequencies","power-line bouncing suppression","split-bank architecture","multiplexed global address-bus","local column address counter","global data-bus architecture","twin-well CMOS process","256 Mbit","32 bit","200 MHz"]}],"abstract":"A 32 bit-wide 256 M synchronous DRAM (SDRAM) has been developed.

High speed low power operation is realized due to reduced junction capacitances. Moreover, since the capacitance ratio Cb/Cs is reduced, the read out signal amplitude increases. For these reasons SOI is well suited to low power supply voltage DRAMs. However, because SOI uses body-floating transistors for memory cells, there is a possibility that majority carriers within the floating body can cause problems. To date, only the static data retention characteristics have been reported, with nothing written about the dynamic data retention characteristics for full DRAM operation. This paper details the results of an analysis of the floating body caused leakage mechanism and its effect on dynamic data retention. A proposal is made to obtain superior dynamic data retention time.","doi":"10.1109/VLSIT.1995.520897","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSIT.1995.520897","publicationTitle":"1995 Symposium on VLSI Technology.

Earlier work has shown that neural networks offer great promise in modeling complex fabrication processes such as reactive ion etching (RIE). Motivated by these results, this paper explores the use of neural networks for real-time, model-based control of semiconductor manufacturing processes. This objective is accomplished in part by constructing a q-step ahead predictive model for the system, which can be inverted (or approximately inverted) to achieve the desired control. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated: (1) using a process simulated by a nonlinear equation; (2) using experimental input/output data from an actual RIE process to examine run-by-run control; and (3) by performing real-time, one-step ahead predictive control of a dynamic process which reflects typical RIE behavior.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.1995.520948","startPage":"1240","endPage":"1244 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","pdfPath":"/iel3/3920/11351/00520948.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.1995.520948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time predictive control of semiconductor manufacturing processes using neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive control","Semiconductor device manufacture","Manufacturing processes","Neural networks","Predictive models","Circuits","Process control","Industrial control","Manufacturing industries","Fabrication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["predictive control","process control","neural nets","sputter etching","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic process","semiconductor manufacturing processes","neural networks","process control","reactive ion etching","real-time model-based control","q-step ahead predictive model","nonlinear equation","experimental input/output data","run-by-run control","real-time one-step ahead predictive control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/520948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Real-time predictive control of semiconductor manufacturing processes using neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1995","accessionNumber":"5058021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time predictive control of semiconductor manufacturing processes using neural networks","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00520948.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038608S","chronDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3920","citationCount":"9","articleId":"520948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":520951,"authors":[{"name":"Y.E.

The neural network is used to identify the relation between system variables and parameters of a dynamical system. Two different algorithms, a block estimation method and a recursive estimation method are presented. In the block estimation method, the neural network approximates the mapping between the system response and the system parameters, while in the recursive method, the parameter estimates are recursively updated by incorporating new information. Both methods are useful for parameter estimation in systems where either the structure of the nonlinearities present are unknown or when the parameters occur nonlinearly. Analytical conditions under which successful estimation can be carried out are studied. How the algorithms can be applied to control of nonlinear systems with unknown parameters and the associated stability issues are also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.1995.520969","pdfPath":"/iel3/3920/11351/00520969.pdf","startPage":"1345","endPage":"1349 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.1995.520969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent control using /spl theta/-adaptive neural networks: a new approach to identification and control of nonlinear systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/520969/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent control using /spl theta/-adaptive neural networks: a new approach to identification and control of nonlinear systems","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5058042","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent control using /spl theta/-adaptive neural networks: a new approach to identification and control of nonlinear systems","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00520969.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03642S","chronDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3920","articleId":"520969","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":520971,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The neural-network controller adapts in real-time to account for multiple destabilizing thruster failures. The adaptive control system is similar in structure to a conventional indirect adaptive control system. While a system identification process builds a model of the robot, a neural controller is trained concurrently using backpropagation to optimize performance using this model. The active controller is updated every few seconds, yielding quick adaptation. Stability is restored within 4 seconds, system identification is complete within 48 seconds, and near-optimal performance is achieved within 2 minutes.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.1995.520971","startPage":"1355","endPage":"1359 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","pdfPath":"/iel3/3920/11351/00520971.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.1995.520971","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable control of a free-flying space robot using neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Orbital robotics","Neural networks","Adaptive control","Robot control","Laboratories","Backpropagation","Attitude control","System identification","Programmable control","Control design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace control","space vehicles","mobile robots","neurocontrollers","adaptive control","backpropagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable neural-network-based adaptive control system","free-flying space robot","position control","attitude control","on-off air thrusters","real-time adaptation","multiple destabilizing thruster failures","indirect adaptive control system","concurrent training","backpropagation","performance optimization","stability","system identification","4 s","48 s","2 min"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/520971/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable control of a free-flying space robot using neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1995","accessionNumber":"5058044","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable control of a free-flying space robot using neural networks","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00520971.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059506S","chronDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3920","citationCount":"15","articleId":"520971","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":520974,"authors":[{"name":"T.-H.

The proposed technique utilizes dimensionality reduction to develop the neural network for sensor failure detection and data recovery. In this work, the sensor validation scheme is applied in closed loop for detection and recovery of sensor faults in a simulation of the Space Shuttle main engine (SSME) control. The performance of the sensor validation scheme is evaluated based on its ability to detect sensor faults and provide estimates of the actual signals for the SSME engine controller after the sensor faults have been detected. In the simulation, a group of eleven sensors with known analytical redundancy on the fuel side of the SSME is selected for the sensor validation algorithm. Four sensor outputs in this group are used by the controller to regulate the key performance parameters such as thrust and mixture ratio of the engine. The generation of the training data and the training techniques are discussed. The simulation results show that the proposed sensor validation scheme can adequately compensate up to three sensor failures without major deterioration in performance. The effect of the delay time in detecting sensor failures and the transition from the failed sensor values to the estimated values for the controller are discussed. Abilities and constraints of the neural network-based sensor validation scheme are also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.1995.520974","startPage":"1367","endPage":"1372 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.1995.520974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11351","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","pdfPath":"/iel3/3920/11351/00520974.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based sensor validation for reusable rocket engines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/520974/","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based sensor validation for reusable rocket engines","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"5058047","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based sensor validation for reusable rocket engines","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00520974.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045817S","chronDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3920","citationCount":"20","articleId":"520974","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":521000,"authors":[{"name":"S.L.

Experimental results are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-level adaptive fuzzy filter for mixed noise removal","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISCAS'95 - International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1995.521425","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISCAS'95 - International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/3941/11413/00521425.pdf","startPage":"1524","endPage":"1527 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1995.521425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11413","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=521425","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/521425/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 1995-May 3 1995","displayDocTitle":"Multi-level adaptive fuzzy filter for mixed noise removal","conferenceDate":"30 April-3 May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5112947","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-level adaptive fuzzy filter for mixed noise removal","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00521425.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051279S","chronDate":"April 30 1995-May 3 1995","isNumber":"11413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3941","citationCount":"17","articleId":"521425","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":521429,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Although the VINCI circuit can be used for real-time encryption in high-speed networks such as ATM, there are requirements for VLSI circuits with faster encryption ability. Further, the implemented test during the normal operation in the VINCI chip cannot detect all possible errors. The proposed new implementation is motivated by the requirement for higher data rates and a new solution for the on-line test problem, which is a main task in implementing cryptographic algorithms. First design results show that the resulting circuit can achieve an encryption rate of about 355 Mb/s. This is achieved by the implementation of one round in a 0.8 /spl mu/m CMOS technology. The architecture includes a concurrent self-test based on a mod-3 residue code self-checking system which allows the detection of permanent and temporary single- and multiple-bit errors in the IDEA datapath and hence the secure prevention of faulty encrypted or decrypted data.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1995.521534","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISCAS'95 - International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISCAS'95 - International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/3941/11412/00521534.pdf","startPage":"397","endPage":"400 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1995.521534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11412","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=521534","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the VLSI implementation of the international data encryption algorithm IDEA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 1995-May 3 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/521534/","displayDocTitle":"On the VLSI implementation of the international data encryption algorithm IDEA","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"30 April-3 May 1995","accessionNumber":"5086505","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the VLSI implementation of the international data encryption algorithm IDEA","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00521534.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065057S","chronDate":"April 30 1995-May 3 1995","isNumber":"11412","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3941","citationCount":"22","articleId":"521534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":521538,"authors":[{"name":"J.

We provide precise theorems which show that even under such situations, stable reconstruction from a nonuniformly decimated version is often possible.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1995.521585","publicationTitle":"1995 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel3/3941/11412/00521585.pdf","startPage":"601","endPage":"604 vol.1","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1995.521585","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction of sequences from nonuniform samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 1995-May 3 1995","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction of sequences from nonuniform samples","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"30 April-3 May 1995","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5105956","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/521585/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction of sequences from nonuniform samples","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00521585.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025531S","chronDate":"April 30 1995-May 3 1995","isNumber":"11412","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3941","citationCount":"11","articleId":"521585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":521587,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The effect of overfitting is shown by: 1) visualising the shape of the decision boundaries in feature space during the learning process, and 2) by plotting the classification accuracy of independent test sets versus the number of training cycles. A solution to the overfitting problem is proposed that, involves pre-processing the training data. The method relies on obtaining an increase of spectral coherence of individual training classes by applying k-nearest neighbour filtering. Points in feature space with class labels inconsistent with those of the majority of their neighbours are removed. This effectively simplifies the training data, and removes outliers and local inconsistencies. It is shown that using this approach can reduce the overfitting effect and increase the resulting classification accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Jul1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/521718/","accessionNumber":"5112834","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-14 July 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Improving neural network generalisation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving neural network generalisation","confLoc":"Firenze, Italy","sourcePdf":"00521718.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05548S","chronDate":"10-14 Jul1995","isNumber":"11410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3940","citationCount":"7","articleId":"521718","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":521719,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This paper investigates a Multilayer Neural Network (MNN) for the real-time identification and control of a DC motor. The MNN is first trained to learn the inverse dynamics of the system and after the training is complete, the neural network is used as a feedforward controller to generate the input voltage for the motor to follow a pre-selected trajectories in position and speed. The training data is generated from the hardware setup (DC motor and servo amplifier) by applying a control voltage to the servo amplifier and observing the system output (motor speed). The main advantage of this scheme is that it does not require any knowledge of the system dynamics (and its nonlinear characteristics) and therefore treat the system as a black box. Experimental results show that the MNN is capable of identifying the motor system accurately and is able to control its position and speed with high degree of accuracy, even in the presence of disturbances.","doi":"10.1109/NAECON.1995.521998","startPage":"593","endPage":"600 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1995 National Aerospace and Electronics Conference.

However, the complexity of robot dynamic model makes this difficult to achieve in practice. Neural networks are an attractive alternative for identification and control of robotic manipulators, because of their ability to learn and approximate functions. This paper presents the development of an adaptive Multilayer Neural Network (MNN) as a feedforward controller for a robotic manipulator. The MNN is trained to identify the unknown nonlinear plant (inverse dynamics of a robotic manipulator) using a modified back-propagation technique. A PD controller is used in the feedback loop to guarantee global asymptotic stability. Also, the output of the PD controller is used as a learning signal for the on-line learning to adjust the weights of the MNN to capture any parameters variation and/or disturbances. The controller architecture developed has been simulated and its effect on the trajectory tracking performance of a manipulator has been evaluated and compared to the conventional adaptive controller.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/521999/","accessionNumber":"5182872","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"22-26 May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive neural network for identification and tracking control of a robotic manipulator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive neural network for identification and tracking control of a robotic manipulator","confLoc":"Dayton, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00521999.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07333S","chronDate":"22-26 May 1995","isNumber":"11342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3912","citationCount":"3","articleId":"521999","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":522079,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Comparing with control devices on InP substrates we conclude that this is a very promising approach for improved manufacturability with uncompromised performance. GaAs- and InP-substrate MODFETs have a similar combination of maximum current and breakdown voltage. GaAs-substrate MODFETs have lower gate leakage and improved pinchoff. The lower leakage reduces the noise, and on a wafer with low interfacial gate resistance a median minimum noise figure of 0.25 dB at 12 GHz, with 15 dB associated gain, was measured on wafer. High cutoff frequencies are maintained when switching to the GaAs substrate, and the g/sub m/-dispersion is reduced. Despite larger dislocation density, mostly contained by the LGLTBL, the FET yield on GaAs appears to be comparable to that on InP.

This study is carried out with PZT P188 and PZT P189 prismatic rods. The inter-electrodes distance is t and L is the length along the polar axis. Samples with aspect ratio t/L lying between 0.04 and 20 have been characterised using a resonance method. The k/sub 15/ coefficient is then derived with either a constant field model (high t/L) or a constant induction model (small t/L). The dependencies of k/sub 15/, d/sub 15/ and /spl epsiv//sub 11//sup T/ on the aspect ratio are given. The derived d/sub 15/ constants are compared with a direct measurement, made in a quasi-static mode using a Laser Doppler Vibrometry technique, and with ATILA F.E.M. simulations. For low t/L ratios, a clamping of the bar is shown. Moreover, /spl epsiv//sub 11//sup T/ is strongly dependent on the aspect ratio. For high t/L ratios, no clamping is observed and the permittivity is roughly constant. Finally, the use of a constant field model is justified.

The nonlinear mapping capabilities of trained neural networks are employed to generate an estimate of the input noise through parallel processing of the Doppler information, the innovation process, and heading change estimate of a maneuvering target in clutter.

In mid-September 1993, both the FOA and SRI sensors collected HH-polarization VHF and UHF band data, respectively, over the forest in northern Maine. The collected data were processed into calibrated SAR imagery. HH foliage backscatter statistics were calculated for all frequency bands. HH foliage-induced attenuation for all frequency bands was calculated by comparing returns from test reflectors hidden by foliage with returns from open-field reflectors. Both backscatter and attenuation results are reported and compared with July 1990 UHF-, L-, and C-band measurements of the Maine site.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rain","Backscatter","Frequency","Attenuation","Synthetic aperture radar","UHF measurements","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Ultra wideband technology","Polarization","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synthetic aperture radar","radar imaging","radar cross-sections","backscatter","electromagnetic wave polarisation","electromagnetic wave reflection","attenuation measurement","VHF radio propagation","UHF radio propagation","radar applications","airborne radar","search radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["northern US forest","airborne surveillance systems","SAR foliage penetration","tropical rain forest","radar measurements","Swedish National Defense Research Establishment","CARABAS sensor","SRI International Ultra-Wideband SAR","UHF data","VHF data","horizontal-transmit/horizontal-receive polarization","Fort Sherman","Panama","C-band measurements","L-band measurements","sensors","northern Maine","calibrated SAR imagery","backscatter statistics","frequency bands","foliage-induced attenuation","test reflectors","open-field reflectors","attenuation results"]}],"doi":"10.1109/RADAR.1995.522538","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings International Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/3929/11378/00522538.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.1995.522538","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAR foliage penetration phenomenology of tropical rain forest and northern US forest","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=522538","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SAR foliage penetration phenomenology of tropical rain forest and northern US forest","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/522538/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5169816","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAR foliage penetration phenomenology of tropical rain forest and northern US forest","confLoc":"Alexandria, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00522538.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037093S","chronDate":"8-11 May 1995","isNumber":"11378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3929","citationCount":"29","articleId":"522538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":522547,"authors":[{"name":"T.H.

The authors introduce a neural network architecture which performs signal detection and direction finding (DF) despite antenna degradations and failures.

They also test and compare the performance of the neural beamformer and monopulse on simulations of antenna models containing induced degradations and failures. Finally, they retrain the neural beamformer with measured antenna data from a 32-element X-band antenna and test its detection and DF performance, comparing DF results with a calibrated monopulse technique and against simulated antenna model performance for several SNRs.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.1995.522547","pdfPath":"/iel3/3929/11378/00522547.pdf","startPage":"213","endPage":"218","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings International Radar Conference","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Radar Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.1995.522547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network antenna processing for detection and direction finding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/522547/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Neural network antenna processing for detection and direction finding","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5169825","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network antenna processing for detection and direction finding","confLoc":"Alexandria, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00522547.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035894S","chronDate":"8-11 May 1995","isNumber":"11378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3929","citationCount":"3","articleId":"522547","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":522551,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The interference is modelled as a random process, representative of voice signal, which produces an RF signal by amplitude modulation (AM), double side band (DSB) modulation or frequency modulation (FM). Several schemes for the radar receiver/signal processor are analyzed to evaluate the effects of interference. The statistical model used for the voice modulating signal is presented, along with the generation of the audio modulated interference. Radar performance evaluation has been carried out by Monte Carlo simulation and the results are presented in terms of the receiver operating characteristics, namely P/sub d/ and P/sub fa/ vs. signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and interference-to-noise ratio (INR). The results are interpreted by means of a statistical analysis of the underlying signals at some relevant points in the receiver.

The severe range migration associated with fine resolution UWB/WB SAR poses a significant problem for the image formation algorithm. The combination of a long synthetic aperture and a wide azimuth beamwidth has important implications for motion compensation implementation and performance. We survey the major challenges to UWB/WB SAR image formation. The emphasis is on the formation of fine resolution digital imagery from low frequency UWB/WB data collected in the stripmap mode by an airborne SAR system. We examine the differences in image formation and data processing between UWB/WB systems and conventional SAR systems.

Short range applications such as collision avoidance and missile seekers use homodyne FMCW radar. Good range resolution is important to target-to-clutter contrast and to support target discrimination. In FMCW radar systems, range resolution depends on the transmitted bandwidth, the processed overlap between the transmitted and received frequency sweeps, the receiver frequency resolution, and the frequency sweep linearity. Frequency sweep nonlinearity is often the limiting factor in FMCW radar range resolution. This paper specifically addresses the effect of both the amplitude and the frequency of the sinusoidal frequency sweep nonlinearity on the target return spectrum and consequently the range resolution. These results are applicable to the design of modem closed-loop linearizers such as those used for varactor tuned Gunn diode oscillators in millimeter wave (MMW) FMCW radars, because after piecewise linear compensation the residual errors are approximately sinusoidal.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.1995.522609","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings International Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/3929/11378/00522609.pdf","startPage":"563","endPage":"567","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.1995.522609","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Homodyne FMCW radar range resolution effects with sinusoidal nonlinearities in the frequency sweep","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=522609","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/522609/","displayDocTitle":"Homodyne FMCW radar range resolution effects with sinusoidal nonlinearities in the frequency sweep","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5161248","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Homodyne FMCW radar range resolution effects with sinusoidal nonlinearities in the frequency sweep","confLoc":"Alexandria, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00522609.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031095S","chronDate":"8-11 May 1995","isNumber":"11378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3929","citationCount":"71","articleId":"522609","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":522611,"authors":[{"name":"G.S.

Considerable work has been done in designing novel architectures to perform the DWT, including a systolic architecture designed by the authors, but little attention has been given to the inverse DWT which is needed in applications such as data compression for signal reconstruction. Despite the fact that the inverse DWT is computationally the reverse of the DWT, the hardware design for the architecture is not simply mirrored. Existing designs expect the architecture for the inverse DWT to be a simple follow-on step from the DWT design, however this is not the case. We present one such problem here, showing the FIFO buffering required on the input of the inverse architecture. We show how the size of this buffer can be calculated and compare it to a fixed data array implementation. This work is based on our systolic array design and is an integral part of the inverse DWT design we are working on for image and video compression.","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.1995.522920","publicationTitle":"Proceedings The International Conference on Application Specific Array Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings The International Conference on Application Specific Array Processors","pdfPath":"/iel3/3953/11435/00522920.pdf","startPage":"166","endPage":"173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.1995.522920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11435","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Input buffering requirements of a systolic array for the inverse discrete wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=522920","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Jul 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/522920/","displayDocTitle":"Input buffering requirements of a systolic array for the inverse discrete wavelet transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5065467","conferenceDate":"24-26 July 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Input buffering requirements of a systolic array for the inverse discrete wavelet transform","confLoc":"Strasbourg, France","sourcePdf":"00522920.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04485S","chronDate":"24-26 Jul 1995","isNumber":"11435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3953","citationCount":"3","articleId":"522920","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":522921,"authors":[{"name":"Jongwoo Bae","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Jongwoo Bae","id":"37290833700"},{"name":"V.K.

Our design offers the following features: (1) The bit-level arrays are estimated to offer 200+% speed-up over word-level arrays. (2) When compared with word-level system with same throughput, the bit-level designs reduce control complexity, bus/routing area, and data buffering.

The radix-4 CORDIC algorithm halves the number of microrotations with respect the traditionally radix-2 algorithm with the drawback of a non-constant scale factor. Seeking a good compromise between silicon area and latency we have used digit on-line processing. This way the data inputs the processor in blocks of bits (digits) in MSD-first mode of processing. We have used redundant carry-save arithmetic to allow carry-free additions and on-line processing.

In this paper we will propose two algorithms and architectures in order to perform the compensation of the scale factor in parallel with the computation of the CORDIC iterations. This way it is not necessary to carry out the final multiplication or add scaling iterations in order to achieve the compensation. With the architectures we propose the dependence on n of the compensation of the scale factor disappears, and this considerably reduces the latency of the system. The architectures developed are optimized solutions for the different operating modes of the CORDIC both in conventional and in redundant arithmetic.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Arithmetic","Iterative algorithms","Vectors","Concurrent computing","Delay","Algebra","Image processing","Matrix decomposition","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel architectures","digital arithmetic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel compensation","scale factor","CORDIC algorithm","CORDIC architectures"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=522930","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.1995.522930","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings The International Conference on Application Specific Array Processors","pdfPath":"/iel3/3953/11435/00522930.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.1995.522930","startPage":"258","endPage":"269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11435","publicationTitle":"Proceedings The International Conference on Application Specific Array Processors","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CORDIC architectures with parallel compensation of the scale factor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"CORDIC architectures with parallel compensation of the scale factor","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/522930/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Jul 1995","conferenceDate":"24-26 July 1995","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5065474","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CORDIC architectures with parallel compensation of the scale factor","confLoc":"Strasbourg, France","sourcePdf":"00522930.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045654S","chronDate":"24-26 Jul 1995","isNumber":"11435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3953","citationCount":"24","articleId":"522930","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":522932,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This is the most complicated rational operation: it involves GCD, exact division, multiplication and addition/subtraction. In particular the implementation of GCD and exact division improve significantly (2 to 4 times) previously known solutions. In contrast to the traditional approach, all operations are performed least-significant digits first. This allows bit-pipelining between partial operations at reduced area-cost. An Atmel FPGA design for 8-bit operands consumes 730 cells (3,500 equivalent gates) and runs at 25 MHz (5 MHz after layout). For 32-bit operands this would be in the same timing range as the software solutions, however a significant speed-up can be expected for longer operands because the linear time-complexity of the hardware algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.1995.522932","publicationTitle":"Proceedings The International Conference on Application Specific Array Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings The International Conference on Application Specific Array Processors","pdfPath":"/iel3/3953/11435/00522932.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.1995.522932","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11435","startPage":"282","endPage":"289","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a systolic coprocessor for rational addition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=522932","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of a systolic coprocessor for rational addition","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Jul 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/522932/","conferenceDate":"24-26 July 1995","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5065476","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a systolic coprocessor for rational addition","confLoc":"Strasbourg, France","sourcePdf":"00522932.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041569S","chronDate":"24-26 Jul 1995","isNumber":"11435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3953","citationCount":"2","articleId":"522932","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":523004,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The ONU-receiver is composed of k-parallel unit memory decoder, k/k+1 rated systematic encoder, cascaded with a PRS channel model. The combined trellis structure of ONU-receiver reduces the state number from 2/sup k/2/sup /spl nu//2/sup k+1/ resulting from k-unit memory of the parallel precoders, /spl nu/ unit memory of the systematic encoder and (k+1) unit memory of the PRS channel model to only 2/sup k+/spl nu//. Therefore considering the PRS channel together with classical trellis coded M-QAM structures does not increase the state number and decoding complexity. The ONU receiver improves both the bandwidth efficiency and error performance with no resulting increase in the decoding complexity. As an example, the error event lower bound of the ONU-receiver is derived for 4QAM-TCM having an encoder memory /spl nu/=1 and /spl nu/=2 in AWGN and colored noise environments.","doi":"10.1109/ICSC.1994.523137","startPage":"76","endPage":"79 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Satellite Communications.

A simpler method is proposed to determine the partial inductance between two or three sources and sinks which are of importance in EMC/EMI considerations.

The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method can model shielding enclosures with complex geometries, but has difficulty modeling wires and cables of arbitrary radii. Modeling the wire by setting the axial component of the electric field to zero in the FDTD results in a wire with a radius determined by the mesh discretisation. Neglecting wire radius in applications such as electromagnetic interference (EMI) or printed circuit board modeling may result in gross errors because near field quantities are typically sensitive to wire thickness. Taflove (1990) developed a wire modeling algorithm for FDTD analysis which models wires well for far-field calculations such as the radar cross section. The method uses a quasi-static field approximation to model wires with a user-specified radius. The wire model is reviewed and investigated for near-field accuracy via input impedance computations, since FCC class A and B regulations are tested in the near field. The input impedance for a center-fed dipole antenna is computed with FDTD methods and compared to the input impedance results from moment methods. A simulation of a shielding enclosure with an attached cable demonstrates the utility of FDTD analysis in EMC applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel3/3965/11452/00523540.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"173","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/ISEMC.1995.523540","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISEMC.1995.523540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11452","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=523540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD modeling of thin wires for simulating common-mode radiation from structures with attached cables","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Wires","Cables","Impedance","Solid modeling","Electromagnetic interference","Apertures","Geometry","Printed circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic interference","electromagnetic compatibility","cables (electric)","finite difference time-domain analysis","electromagnetic shielding","packaging","radar cross-sections","wires (electric)","approximation theory","electric impedance","dipole antennas","antenna feeds","digital simulation","simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["common-mode radiation simulation","cables","thin wires","FDTD modeling","shielding enclosures","apertures","finite-difference time-domain","moment methods","center-fed dipole antenna","electric field","mesh discretisation","wire radius","electromagnetic interference","EMI","printed circuit board modeling","wire thickness","wire modeling algorithm","far-field calculations","radar cross section","quasistatic field approximation","near-field accuracy","input impedance","EMC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/523540/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Aug 195","displayDocTitle":"FDTD modeling of thin wires for simulating common-mode radiation from structures with attached cables","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5231354","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-18 Aug. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD modeling of thin wires for simulating common-mode radiation from structures with attached cables","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00523540.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05052S","chronDate":"14-18 Aug 195","isNumber":"11452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3965","citationCount":"4","articleId":"523540","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":523541,"authors":[{"name":"C.E.

When the linewidth is fixed (/spl Delta//spl nu/T=2%), this code can improve the receiver sensitivity by more than 15 dB.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/3956/11438/00523685.pdf","startPage":"338","endPage":"343","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications","doi":"10.1109/SCAC.1995.523685","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCAC.1995.523685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11438","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=523685","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coding to relax laser linewidth requirements for multichannel CPFSK coherent optical communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase noise","Laser noise","Optical receivers","Band pass filters","Distributed feedback devices","Delay","Optical crosstalk","Optical mixing","Optical sensors","Optical fiber communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical crosstalk","Reed-Solomon codes","phase noise","laser noise","frequency shift keying","continuous phase modulation","optical communication","optical receivers","adjacent channel interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichannel coherent communication system","CPFSK","optical communication","Reed-Solomon codes","crosstalk","adjacent channels","laser phase noise","optimum code rate","coding scheme","laser linewidth requirements","receiver sensitivity","100 Mbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/523685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 1995","displayDocTitle":"Coding to relax laser linewidth requirements for multichannel CPFSK coherent optical communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5176458","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding to relax laser linewidth requirements for multichannel CPFSK coherent optical communications","confLoc":"Alexandria, Egypt","sourcePdf":"00523685.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044605S","chronDate":"27-29 July 1995","isNumber":"11438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3956","articleId":"523685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":523703,"authors":[{"name":"E.

In pulp making process, the quality of pulp is measured by the K# which is related to the lignin content remaining in the pulp. Availability of an accurate K# during any time of digester operation is very critical in quality control and saving of million of dollars by reducing energy and raw material consumption. To assure quality control in the digester operation, K# is currently measured by human experts who analyze pulp samples in the plant's laboratory and then decide how to control process variables. Unfortunately, the long measurement time of K# coupled with process time delays has proven to be too costly economically and qualitatively. In our study, a radial basis function (RBF) neural network was implemented for prediction of K#. This network was trained with 350 and tested with 325 hours of real digester operation.

This approach does not require any active memory or A/D and D/A converters, and can be utilized in the design of operational amplifiers and voltage comparators built in a standard CMOS technology. The input offset voltage is constantly adjusted for improved time and temperature stability. The effect of clock feedthrough voltage on the input offset is reduced by employing a new low frequency clocking scheme with long rise and fall times. Continuous operation is achieved by using a parallel processing configuration where two amplifiers operate sequentially for half of each clock period. Power consumption and die area are considerably lower than any other methods with equivalent performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/523871/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 1995-May 3 1995","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 April-3 May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5125430","volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A new offset cancellation technique for CMOS differential amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new offset cancellation technique for CMOS differential amplifiers","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00523871.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02422S","chronDate":"April 30 1995-May 3 1995","isNumber":"11414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3941","citationCount":"5","articleId":"523871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":523872,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The method is first designed for the coherent case (where the desired signal shape is a priori known) and later extended to include the non-coherent case based on orthogonal signal expansion.

Long burst trains with zeroes inserted into the inter-burst intervals can be processed coherently. This kind of processing preserves the phase information of the data. Due to the interference of the burst images the impulse response shows a periodic modulation that can be eliminated by a subsequent low-pass filtering of the detected image. This strategy allows an easy and safe adaptation of existing SAR processors to ScanSAR data if throughput is not an issue. The images are automatically consistent with regular SAR mode images both with respect to geometry and radiometry.

A rate-1/3 convolutional code of constraint length 9, with hard decision Viterbi decoding is considered. The system capacity degradation due to open-loop power control error, which is approximated by a log-normally distributed random variable, is estimated.

The algorithm accommodates different QOS requirements by assigning different power levels to each traffic type, and can add or drop connections dynamically while ensuring that QOS specifications are satisfied.

Also, due to the long term dependency in the traffic and the validity of the Poisson model for a very short interval, the congestion probability formula is approximated with a neural network.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1995.524215","startPage":"810","endPage":"814 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Communications ICC '95","pdfPath":"/iel3/3942/11416/00524215.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Communications ICC '95","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1995.524215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ANN approach for congestion control in packet switch OBP satellite","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Packet switching","Satellites","Neural networks","Traffic control","Communication system traffic control","Telecommunication traffic","Delay estimation","Artificial neural networks","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["satellite links","satellite communication","telecommunication congestion control","packet switching","neural nets","telecommunication traffic","queueing theory","delays","Poisson distribution","estimation theory","prediction theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["congestion control","packet switch OBP satellite","ANN","neural networks application","traffic intensity estimation","downlink queue","traffic load status prediction","frame","round trip delay","linear estimator","nonlinear estimator","Poisson model","congestion probability formula","approximation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/524215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"ANN approach for congestion control in packet switch OBP satellite","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 1995","accessionNumber":"5205228","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ANN approach for congestion control in packet switch OBP satellite","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00524215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049292S","chronDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11416","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3942","citationCount":"5","articleId":"524215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":524223,"authors":[{"name":"P.B.

The services which can benefit from antenna arraying include the planned Motorola's Iridium, power-limited satellites, and NASA's next generation all digital receiver. A full spectrum combining (FSC) system is proposed for coherent staggered-QPSK (SQPSK) signaling and its performance is analyzed assuming imperfect carrier and symbol timing recovery. In order to align the signals for an array of L antennas, the combining system utilizes L-1 differential phase estimators. Each one of these phase difference estimators is shown to be an open loop maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). The performance of this estimator is derived and the variance of the estimate error is compared to the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Next, the performance of this FSC technique is quantified based on the bit error rate loss. The results are verified by simulation for a scenario of two identical base stations arrayed together. The calculated and measured gain when operating at a data rate of 16 kbps and a BER of 10/sup -3/ is 2.8 dB, compared to the ideal (i.e., no losses due to combining or imperfect references) gain of 3 dB in this case.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full spectrum combining of staggered-QPSK signals","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Communications ICC '95","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1995.524228","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Communications ICC '95","pdfPath":"/iel3/3942/11416/00524228.pdf","startPage":"879","endPage":"883 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1995.524228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11416","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=524228","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/524228/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Full spectrum combining of staggered-QPSK signals","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5211725","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full spectrum combining of staggered-QPSK signals","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00524228.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046793S","chronDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11416","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3942","articleId":"524228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":524231,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Wideband CDMA systems offer potential advantages in capacity and ability to integrate different rate services in wireless access systems. We investigate the receiver design alternatives for wideband CDMA systems in microcellular environments. To implement CDMA systems with a bandwidth larger than 10 MHz, the high chip rate presents a major challenge to achieve a receiver with low complexity and low power consumption. The main objective of this paper is to find ways to minimize the receiver complexity and power consumption without introducing significant performance degradation. We consider the use of a receiver with significantly reduced oversampling for wider bandwidths. Measured channel impulse response estimates are used to estimate the performance of this RAKE receiver. The results indicate that for CDMA systems with bandwidth near 20 MHz, one sample per chip may be adequate for the digital RAKE receiver in the outdoor microcellular environment. Two samples per chip may be enough for the indoor systems and the outdoor 10 MHz system.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1995.524232","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Communications ICC '95","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Communications ICC '95","pdfPath":"/iel3/3942/11416/00524232.pdf","startPage":"900","endPage":"904 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1995.524232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complexity considerations in the design of wideband microcellular CDMA receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=524232","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/524232/","displayDocTitle":"Complexity considerations in the design of wideband microcellular CDMA receivers","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5211729","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complexity considerations in the design of wideband microcellular CDMA receivers","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00524232.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053267S","chronDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11416","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3942","citationCount":"1","articleId":"524232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":524233,"authors":[{"name":"M.-H.

Bhargava (1994) proposed using a single line rate (adjusted data rate before spreading) to accommodate traffic with a wide range of source rates. For traffic with source rates higher than the line rate, the authors propose using concatenated orthogonal/PN spreading sequences to subdivide a high rate stream into several parallel line rate streams. The performance of the concatenated orthogonal-PN spreading sequence for homogenous voice traffic in various cellular mobile environments with multipath fading, log-normal shadowing and path loss, is first analyzed and compared with that of the conventional non-concatenated long PN sequence. The authors then evaluate the performance of a system with integrated traffic of voice and video. In conjunction with this, they propose the use of cosets of Walsh-Hadamard (WH) codes to reduce the multi-user interference. Different methods of assigning the spreading sequences among the cosets which improve the capacity of both voice and video users, are investigated.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1995.524233","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Communications ICC '95","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Communications ICC '95","pdfPath":"/iel3/3942/11416/00524233.pdf","startPage":"905","endPage":"909 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1995.524233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concatenated orthogonal/PN spreading scheme for cellular DS-CDMA systems with integrated traffic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=524233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/524233/","displayDocTitle":"Concatenated orthogonal/PN spreading scheme for cellular DS-CDMA systems with integrated traffic","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5211730","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concatenated orthogonal/PN spreading scheme for cellular DS-CDMA systems with integrated traffic","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00524233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057171S","chronDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11416","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3942","citationCount":"6","articleId":"524233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":524249,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Analysis shows that significant reductions in cell loss rate (relative to an uncoded system) and varying degrees of payload error protection are realized with a minimal increase in required bandwidth.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable rate error control for wireless ATM networks","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Communications ICC '95","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1995.524249","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Communications ICC '95","pdfPath":"/iel3/3942/11416/00524249.pdf","startPage":"988","endPage":"992 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1995.524249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11416","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=524249","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/524249/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Variable rate error control for wireless ATM networks","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5211746","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable rate error control for wireless ATM networks","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00524249.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033928S","chronDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11416","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3942","citationCount":"22","articleId":"524249","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":524251,"authors":[{"name":"J.

However, this algorithm, even in its recursive form, poses technical difficulties because of numerical representation problems, the necessity of nonlinear functions and a high number of additions and multiplications. MAP like algorithms operating in the logarithmic domain presented in the past solve the numerical problem and reduce the computational complexity, but are suboptimal especially at low SNR (a common example is the max-log-MAP because of its use of the max function). A further simplification yields the soft-output Viterbi algorithm (SOVA). We present a log-MAP algorithm that avoids the approximations in the max-log-MAP algorithm and hence is equivalent to the true MAP, but without its major disadvantages. We compare the (log-)MAP, max-log-MAP and SOVA from a theoretical point of view to illuminate their commonalities and differences. As a practical example forming the basis for simulations, we consider Turbo decoding, where recursive systematic convolutional component codes are decoded with the three algorithms, and we also demonstrate the practical suitability of the log-MAP by including quantization effects. The SOVA is, at 10/sup -4/, approximately 0.7 dB inferior to the (log-)MAP, the max-log-MAP lying roughly in between. We also present some complexity comparisons and conclude that the three algorithms increase in complexity in the order of their optimality.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1995.524253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1995.524253","startPage":"1009","endPage":"1013 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Communications ICC '95","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Communications ICC '95","pdfPath":"/iel3/3942/11416/00524253.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of optimal and sub-optimal MAP decoding algorithms operating in the log domain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/524253/","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of optimal and sub-optimal MAP decoding algorithms operating in the log domain","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5211750","publicationDate":"1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of optimal and sub-optimal MAP decoding algorithms operating in the log domain","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00524253.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053S","chronDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11416","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3942","citationCount":"1056","articleId":"524253","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":524254,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The performance of such a system is usually given in terms of the bit error rate as a function of the number of active users for a given signal to noise ratio. We have investigated the degradation in the performance of a BPSK modulated, bi-phase spread DS CDMA system due to synchronization errors. A Fourier series approach has been used to find an infinite series representation for the probability of error when both chip timing and carrier phase errors are present. The analysis requires the characteristic functions of both the multiple access interference and self interference and these functions have been expressed in terms of the special functions of mathematical physics. Computation of the infinite series is very fast as a whole bit error curve can be generated in minutes on a Sparc IPX workstation. The infinite series is also compared with the standard Gaussian approximation and an alternative Gaussian approximation found in the literature. The series is then used to assess the reduction in system capacity when synchronization errors are present in the system. We have expressed this degradation in the system performance as an effective processing gain reduction.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1995.524257","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Communications ICC '95","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Communications ICC '95","pdfPath":"/iel3/3942/11416/00524257.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1995.524257","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11416","startPage":"1029","endPage":"1035 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensitivity of a DS CDMA system with long PN sequences to synchronization errors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=524257","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity of a DS CDMA system with long PN sequences to synchronization errors","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/524257/","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5211754","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity of a DS CDMA system with long PN sequences to synchronization errors","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00524257.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038505S","chronDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11416","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3942","citationCount":"15","articleId":"524257","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":524260,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A unified digital bandwidth on demand platform is realized by allocating multiple codes (on demand), and hence increased capacity, to users. This approach, dubbed multi-code CDMA (MC-CDMA), will enable efficient delivery of all services made possible by digital cellular, CDPD, and other PCS technologies. Since a large variety of services (voice, data, image, and perhaps video) is expected in future wireless networks, users with very different, and time-varying, source rates will have to be accommodated. MC-CDMA is a wireless system whose rate (which is proportional to the number of codes assigned to the user) and service are dynamically matched to users' needs and can evolve from commercial digital cellular systems. This system retains the CDMA advantage in combating multipath and does not require significant modifications of the radio frequency (RF) circuitry. The dynamic, packet-like capacity access enabled by MC-CDMA will allow users to access the base station at different source rates, and when all other users are idle, will provide peak rate access to a single user.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1995.524263","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Communications ICC '95","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Communications ICC '95","pdfPath":"/iel3/3942/11416/00524263.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1995.524263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11416","startPage":"1060","endPage":"1064 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-code CDMA wireless personal communications networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=524263","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-code CDMA wireless personal communications networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/524263/","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5211760","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-code CDMA wireless personal communications networks","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00524263.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04626S","chronDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11416","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3942","citationCount":"148","articleId":"524263","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":524285,"authors":[{"name":"Q.

In this paper, we propose and study an efficient demand assignment channel access protocol, which we call distributed-queueing request update multiple access (DQRUMA). The protocol can be used for a wide range of applications and geographic distances. Mobiles need to send requests to the base station only for packets that arrive to an empty buffer. For packets that arrive to a non-empty buffer transmission requests are placed collision-free by piggybacking the requests with packet transmissions. The simulation results show that even with the \"worst possible\" traffic characteristics, the delay-throughput performance of DQRUMA is close to the best possible with any access protocol. In addition, explicit slot-by-slot announcement of the \"transmit permissions\" gives the base station a lot of control over the order in which mobiles transmit their packets.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed-queueing request update multiple access (DQRUMA) for wireless packet (ATM) networks","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Communications ICC '95","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1995.524295","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Communications ICC '95","pdfPath":"/iel3/3942/11416/00524295.pdf","startPage":"1224","endPage":"1231 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1995.524295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11416","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=524295","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/524295/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Distributed-queueing request update multiple access (DQRUMA) for wireless packet (ATM) networks","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5218620","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed-queueing request update multiple access (DQRUMA) for wireless packet (ATM) networks","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00524295.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028838S","chronDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11416","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3942","citationCount":"135","articleId":"524295","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":524296,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The bit error probability of OOK/CDMA is evaluated, and the upper bound on the bit error probability of PPM/CDMA is derived. Further, the performance is compared for some values of the average signal count per second, the length of prime sequences, and the number of simultaneous users under the constraint on throughput. It is found that PPM/CDMA performs better than OOK/CDMA by the pulse position multiplicity. It is also found that as the number of slots per frame of PPM increases, the bit error probability performance is improved. Moreover, it is found that CDMA with longer prime sequence codes has better performance. Therefore, we show that in order to achieve the low bit error probability and many simultaneous users, we should employ PPM/CDMA with larger number of slots and longer prime sequence codes.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1995.524416","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Communications ICC '95","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Communications ICC '95","pdfPath":"/iel3/3942/11417/00524416.pdf","startPage":"1312","endPage":"1316 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1995.524416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11417","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of optical direct-detection CDMA systems using prime sequence codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/524416/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Performance of optical direct-detection CDMA systems using prime sequence codes","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5211767","volume":"3","publicationDate":"1995","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of optical direct-detection CDMA systems using prime sequence codes","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00524416.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050228S","chronDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11417","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3942","citationCount":"11","articleId":"524416","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":524417,"authors":[{"name":"W.C.

The paper analyses the two effects of phase-noise: inter-carrier interference (ICI) and a phase error common to all OFDM sub-carriers. Through numerical integration, the ICI power can be evaluated and is shown as a function of the number of OFDM sub-carriers and various parameters of the phase-noise model. Increasing the number of sub-carriers causes an increase in the ICI power, which our analysis indeed shows to become a potential problem, since it can lead to a BER floor. The analysis allows the design of low-cost tuners through specifying the required phase-noise characteristics. A similar technique is applied to calculate the variance of the common phase error. After showing that the common phase error is essentially uncorrelated from symbol to symbol, we propose a simple feed-forward correction technique based on pilot cells, that dramatically reduces the degradation due to phase-noise. This is confirmed by BER simulations of a coded OFDM scheme (proposed for terrestrial transmission of digital television) with 64 QAM.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the effects of phase-noise in orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) systems","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Communications ICC '95","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1995.524481","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Communications ICC '95","pdfPath":"/iel3/3942/11417/00524481.pdf","startPage":"1652","endPage":"1657 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1995.524481","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11417","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=524481","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/524481/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the effects of phase-noise in orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) systems","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5211832","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the effects of phase-noise in orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) systems","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00524481.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03852S","chronDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11417","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3942","citationCount":"157","articleId":"524481","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":524486,"authors":[{"name":"M.

For instance a single bit error in the bitstream will cause a high degradation of picture quality due to error propagation. Hence, for picture replenishment error concealment techniques (ECTs) may be required at the receiver. The aim of the article is to study different ECTs for MPEG-2 hierarchical coded pictures applied for terrestrial broadcasting. For the base layer different temporal and spatial ECTs are investigated. Two temporal ECTs are considered: a simple temporal error concealment (EC) and a temporal EC with motion compensation. The latter method provides the best results in inter coded pictures (where motion vectors exist). For the intra coded pictures, where no motion information exists, two spatial interpolation techniques are considered. The main problem for spatial EC in MPEG-2 coded pictures is that only the top and the bottom macroblock can be used for interpolation, since one error in the bitstream causes one damaged horizontal stripe of macroblocks in the picture. Different ECTs for the upper layer of hierarchical coded pictures are also investigated.

One fading simulator is based on DSP firmware and realizes the Rician fading model with time variation based on the vehicle Doppler frequency. We also present results that include a commercial channel simulator that operates at an intermediate frequency of 70 MHz. Our experiments are all conducted at a transmission rate of 4800 bps and the results are expected to be applicable to DSP based, mobile satellite communications.

The MIT Alewife machine, a prototype implementation of the architecture, demonstrates that a parallel system can be both scalable and programmable. Four mechanisms combine to achieve these goals: software-extended coherent shared memory provides a global, linear address space; integrated message passing allows compiler and operating system designers to provide efficient communication and synchronization; support for fine-grain computation allows many processors to cooperate on small problem sizes; and latency tolerance mechanisms-including block multithreading and prefetching-mask unavoidable delays due to communication. Microbenchmarks, together with over a dozen complete applications running on the 32-node prototype, help to analyze the behavior of the system. Analysis shows that integrating message passing with shared memory enables a cost-efficient solution to the cache coherence problem and provides a rich set of programming primitives. Block multithreading and prefetching improve performance by up to 25%, individually, and 35% together. Finally, language constructs that allow programmers to express fine-grain synchronization can improve performance by over a factor of two.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 22nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel3/4007/11522/00524544.pdf","startPage":"2","endPage":"13","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 22nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","doi":"10.1109/ISCA.1995.524544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCA.1995.524544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11522","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=524544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The MIT Alewife machine: architecture and performance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prototypes","Message passing","Delay","Multithreading","Prefetching","Mesh networks","Costs","Software prototyping","Computer architecture","Operating systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["message passing","parallel machines","parallel architectures","reconfigurable architectures","parallel programming","shared memory systems","performance evaluation","cache storage","synchronisation","program compilers","operating systems (computers)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIT Alewife machine","multiprocessor architecture","processing nodes","performance","cost-effective mesh network","scalable mesh network","constant cost","prototype implementation","parallel system","programmable system","software-extended coherent shared memory","global linear address space","integrated message passing","compiler designers","operating system designers","synchronization","communication","fine-grain computation","latency tolerance mechanisms","block multithreading","prefetching","microbenchmarks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/524544/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 1995","displayDocTitle":"The MIT Alewife machine: architecture and performance","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5086777","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2005","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The MIT Alewife machine: architecture and performance","confLoc":"Santa Margherita Ligure, Italy","sourcePdf":"00524544.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075289S","chronDate":"22-24 June 1995","isNumber":"11522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4007","citationCount":"118","articleId":"524544","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":524546,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.

One is to quantitatively characterize the SPLASH-2 programs in terms of fundamental properties and architectural interactions that are important to understand them well. The properties we study include the computational load balance, communication to computation ratio and traffic needs, important working set sizes, and issues related to spatial locality, as well as how these properties scale with problem size and the number of processors. The other, related goal is methodological: to assist people who will use the programs in architectural evaluations to prune the space of application and machine parameters in an informed and meaningful way. For example, by characterizing the working sets of the applications, we describe which operating points in terms of cache size and problem size are representative of realistic situations, which are not, and which re redundant.

DSI eliminates invalidation messages by having a processor automatically invalidate its local copy of a cache block before a conflicting access by another processor. Eliminating invalidation overhead is particularly important under sequential consistency: where the latency of invalidating outstanding copies can increase a program's critical path. DSI is applicable to software, hardware, and hybrid coherence schemes. We evaluate DSI in the context of hardware directory-based write-invalidate coherence protocols. Our results show that DSI reduces execution time of a sequentially consistent full-map coherence protocol by as much as 41%. This is comparable to an implementation of weak consistency that uses a coalescing write-buffer to allow up to 16 outstanding requests for exclusive blocks. When used in conjunction with weak consistency DSI can exploit tear-off blocks-which eliminate both invalidation and acknowledgment messages-for a total reduction in messages of up to 26%.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 22nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel3/4007/11522/00524548.pdf","startPage":"48","endPage":"59","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 22nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11522","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=524548","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic self-invalidation: reducing coherence overhead in shared-memory multiprocessors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aerospace electronics","Permission","Delay","Hardware","Government","Distributed computing","Cache memory","Access protocols","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protocols","shared memory systems","cache storage","software performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic self-invalidation","shared-memory multiprocessors","cache coherence overhead reduction","invalidation message elimination","local cache block copy","conflicting access","sequential consistency","outstanding copies","program critical path","hybrid coherence schemes","hardware","software","hardware directory-based write-invalidate coherence protocols","execution time","sequentially consistent full-map coherence protocol","coalescing write-buffer","outstanding requests","exclusive blocks","tear-off blocks","acknowledgment message elimination"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/524548/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 1995","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic self-invalidation: reducing coherence overhead in shared-memory multiprocessors","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5086781","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2005","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic self-invalidation: reducing coherence overhead in shared-memory multiprocessors","confLoc":"Santa Margherita Ligure, Italy","sourcePdf":"00524548.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08327S","chronDate":"22-24 June 1995","isNumber":"11522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4007","citationCount":"53","articleId":"524548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":524556,"authors":[{"name":"S.A.

Although the potential benefits of predicated execution are high, the tradeoffs involved in the design of an instruction set to support predicated execution can be difficult. On one end of the design spectrum, architectural support for full predicated execution requires increasing the number of source operands for all instructions. Full predicate support provides for the most flexibility and the largest potential performance improvements. On the other end, partial predicated execution support, such as conditional moves, requires very little change to existing architectures. This paper presents a preliminary study to qualitatively and quantitatively address the benefit of full and partial predicated execution support. With our current compiler technology, we show that the compiler can use both partial and full predication to achieve speedup in large control-intensive programs. Some details of the code generation techniques are shown to provide insight into the benefit of going from partial to full predication. Preliminary experimental results are very encouraging: partial predication provides an average of 33% performance improvement for an 8-issue processor with no predicate support while full predication provides an additional 30% improvement.","doi":"10.1145/223982.225965","pdfPath":"/iel3/4007/11522/00524556.pdf","startPage":"138","endPage":"149","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 22nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 22nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/223982.225965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11522","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of full and partial predicated execution support for ILP processors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/524556/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 1995","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of full and partial predicated execution support for ILP processors","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2005","accessionNumber":"5093631","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of full and partial predicated execution support for ILP processors","confLoc":"Santa Margherita Ligure, Italy","sourcePdf":"00524556.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042672S","chronDate":"22-24 June 1995","isNumber":"11522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4007","citationCount":"54","articleId":"524556","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":524567,"authors":[{"name":"F.

One of the factors is the increasing complexity of memory hierarchies. Most modern machines now use at least one level of cache memory. To reduce execution stalls, cache misses must be very low. Software techniques used to improve locality have been developed for numerical codes, such as loop blocking and copying. Unfortunately, the behavior of direct mapped and set associative caches is still erratic when large numerical data is accessed. Execution time can vary drastically for the same loop kernel depending on uncontrolled factors such as array leading size. The only software method available to improve execution time stability is the copying of frequently used data, which is costly in execution time. Users are not usually cache organisation experts. They are not aware of such phenomena, and have no control over it. In this paper, we show that the recently proposed four-way skewed associative cache yields very stable execution times and good average miss ratios on blocked algorithms. As a result execution time is faster and much more predictable than with conventional caches. As a result of its better comportment, it is possible to use larger blocks sizes with blocked algorithms, which will furthermore reduce blocking overhead costs.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 22nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel3/4007/11522/00524567.pdf","startPage":"265","endPage":"274","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 22nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11522","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=524567","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Skewed associativity enhances performance predictability","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Permission","Kernel","Electronic mail","Stability","Costs","Distributed computing","Computational efficiency","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","content-addressable storage","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["skewed associativity","performance predictability","complexity","memory hierarchies","cache memory","cache misses","loop blocking","copying","set associative caches","execution time stability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/524567/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 1995","displayDocTitle":"Skewed associativity enhances performance predictability","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5086792","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2005","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Skewed associativity enhances performance predictability","confLoc":"Santa Margherita Ligure, Italy","sourcePdf":"00524567.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026987S","chronDate":"22-24 June 1995","isNumber":"11522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4007","citationCount":"12","articleId":"524567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":524568,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Fetch prediction is the process of determining the next instruction to request from the memory subsystem. Branch prediction is the process of predicting the likely out-come of branch instructions. Several researchers have proposed very effective fetch and branch prediction mechanisms including branch target buffers (BTB) that store the target addresses of taken branches. An alternative approach fetches the instruction following a branch by using an index into the cache instead of a branch target address. We call such an index a next cache line and set (NLS) predictor. A NLS predictor is a pointer into the instruction cache, indicating the target instruction of a branch. In this paper we examine the use of NLS predictors for efficient and accurate fetch and branch prediction. Previous studies associated each NLS predictor with a cache line and provided only one-bit conditional branch predictors. Our study examines the use of NLS predictors with highly accurate two-level correlated conditional branch architectures. We examine the performance of decoupling the NLS predictors from the cache line and storing them in a separate tag-less memory buffer. Our results show that the decoupled architecture performs better than associating the NLS predictors with the cache line, that the NLS architecture benefits from reduced cache miss rates, and it is particularly effective for programs containing many branches. We also provide an in-depth comparison between the NLS and BTB architectures, showing that the NLS architecture is a competitive alternative to the BTB design.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=524569","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 22nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 22nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel3/4007/11522/00524569.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11522","startPage":"287","endPage":"296","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/524569/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 1995","displayDocTitle":"Next cache line and set prediction","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2005","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 1995","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5086794","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Next cache line and set prediction","confLoc":"Santa Margherita Ligure, Italy","sourcePdf":"00524569.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052148S","chronDate":"22-24 June 1995","isNumber":"11522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4007","citationCount":"24","articleId":"524569","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":524573,"authors":[{"name":"T.M.

These processors are also powered by highly-parallel superscalar cores. The potential performance can only be exploited when fed by high instruction bandwidth. This task is the responsibility of the instruction fetch unit. Accurate branch prediction and low I-cache miss ratios are essential for the efficient operation of the fetch unit. Several studies on cache design and branch prediction address this problem. However, these techniques are not sufficient. Even in the presence of efficient cache designs and branch prediction, the fetch unit must continuously extract multiple, non-sequential instructions from the instruction cache, realign these in the proper order, and supply them to the decoder. This paper explores solutions to this problem and presents several schemes with varying degrees of performance and cost. The most-general scheme, the collapsing buffer, achieves near-perfect performance and consistently aligns instructions in excess of 90% of the time, over a wide range of issue rates. The performance boost provided by compiler optimization techniques is also investigated. Results show that compiler optimization can significantly enhance performance across all schemes. The collapsing buffer supplemented by compiler techniques remains the best-performing mechanism. The paper closes with recommendations and suggestions for future.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 22nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel3/4007/11522/00524573.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11522","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 22nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","startPage":"333","endPage":"344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of instruction fetch mechanisms for high issue rates","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=524573","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 1995","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of instruction fetch mechanisms for high issue rates","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/524573/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5086798","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2005","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of instruction fetch mechanisms for high issue rates","confLoc":"Santa Margherita Ligure, Italy","sourcePdf":"00524573.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051169S","chronDate":"22-24 June 1995","isNumber":"11522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4007","citationCount":"53","articleId":"524573","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":524574,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This paper presents evidence that current software-development practices produce applications that exhibit substantially higher instruction-cache miss ratios than do the SPEC benchmarks. To represent these trends, we have assembled a collection of applications, called the instruction benchmark suite (IBS), that provides a better test of instruction-cache performance. We discuss the rationale behind the design of IBS and characterize its behavior relative to the SPEC benchmark suite. Our analysis is based on trace-driven and trap-driven simulations and takes into full account both the application and operating-system components of the workloads. This paper then reexamines a collection of previously-proposed hardware mechanisms for improving instruction-fetch performance in the context of the IBS workloads. We study the impact of cache organization transfer bandwidth, prefetching, and pipe-lined memory systems on machines that rely on the use of relatively small primary instruction caches to facilitate increased clock rates. We find that, although of little use for SPEC, the right combination of these techniques substantially benefits IBS. Even so, under IBS, a stubborn lower bound on the instruction-fetch CPI remains as an obstacle to improving overall processor performance.","startPage":"345","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 22nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 22nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel3/4007/11522/00524574.pdf","endPage":"356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11522","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Instruction fetching: Coping with code bloat","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/524574/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 1995","displayDocTitle":"Instruction fetching: Coping with code bloat","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5086799","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2005","publicationDate":"1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Instruction fetching: Coping with code bloat","confLoc":"Santa Margherita Ligure, Italy","sourcePdf":"00524574.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070916S","chronDate":"22-24 June 1995","isNumber":"11522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4007","citationCount":"36","articleId":"524574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":524578,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

Simultaneous multithreading has the potential to achieve 4 times the throughput of a superscalar, and double that of fine-grain multi-threading. We evaluate several cache configurations made possible by this type of organization and evaluate tradeoffs between them. We also show that simultaneous multithreading is an attractive alternative to single-chip multiprocessors; simultaneous multithreaded processors with a variety of organizations outperform corresponding conventional multiprocessors with similar execution resources.

Generating the corner cases to test these designs is a mostly manual process, where completion is hard to judge. Experience shows that the errors that are caught late in the design, many post-silicon, are interactions between different components in very improbable corner case situations. In this paper we present a technique that targets such error-causing interactions by automatically generating test vectors that will cause the processor to exercise all transitions of the control logic in simulation. We use techniques from formal verification to derive transition tours of a fully enumerated state graph of the control logic of the processor. Our system works from a Verilog description of the original machine and is currently being used to validate an embedded dual-issue processor in the node controller of the Stanford FLASH Multiprocessor. Modeling the processor control results in 200 K states and an 8M instruction trace to check all transitions of control arcs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architecture validation for processors","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 22nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 22nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel3/4007/11522/00524579.pdf","startPage":"404","endPage":"413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11522","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=524579","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/524579/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 1995","displayDocTitle":"Architecture validation for processors","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2005","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5086804","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecture validation for processors","confLoc":"Santa Margherita Ligure, Italy","sourcePdf":"00524579.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03522S","chronDate":"22-24 June 1995","isNumber":"11522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4007","citationCount":"60","articleId":"524579","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":524580,"authors":[{"name":"G.S.

A single program is divided into a collection of tasks by a combination of software and hardware. The tasks are distributed to a number of parallel processing units which reside within a processor complex. Each of these units fetches and executes instructions belonging to its assigned task. The appearance of a single logical register file is maintained with a copy in each parallel processing unit. Register results are dynamically routed among the many parallel processing units with the help of compiler-generated masks. Memory accesses may occur speculatively without knowledge of preceding loads or stores. Addresses are disambiguated dynamically, many in parallel, and processing waits only for true data dependences. This paper presents the philosophy of the multiscalar paradigm, the structure of multiscalar programs, and the hardware architecture of a multiscalar processor. The paper also discusses performance issues in the multiscalar model, and compares the multiscalar paradigm with other paradigms. Experimental results evaluating the performance of a sample of multiscalar organizations are also presented.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Parallel processing","Registers","Counting circuits","Concurrent computing","High level languages","Program processors","Legged locomotion","Aggregates","VLIW"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel processing","performance evaluation","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiscalar processors","instruction level parallelism","ordinary high level language programs","parallel processing units","logical register file","compiler-generated masks","hardware architecture","performance evaluation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=524580","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 22nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel3/4007/11522/00524580.pdf","startPage":"414","endPage":"425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11522","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 22nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiscalar processors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiscalar processors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/524580/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 1995","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 1995","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2005","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5086805","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiscalar processors","confLoc":"Santa Margherita Ligure, Italy","sourcePdf":"00524580.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057227S","chronDate":"22-24 June 1995","isNumber":"11522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4007","citationCount":"234","articleId":"524580","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":524607,"authors":[{"name":"H.C.

About 4000 /spl Aring/ field oxide grown in a 1100/spl deg/C wet ambient is found to be optimal for field oxide thinning and bird's beak \"punch-through\" effects. At a given pad oxide thickness of 100 /spl Aring/ the end-of-line encroachment is the largest for MSL isolation, which essentially rules out MSL as a possible candidate. Although both SSMSL and RSSMSL have similarly good isolation characteristics and diode leakages, only RSSMSL has the undesirable subthreshold double-hump effect and reduced gate oxide integrity, both of which are due to the sharp corners associated with the silicon recess etch of the RSSMSL structure. Therefore, for the three structure studied, only SSMSL is a viable candidate for the 0.6 /spl mu/m-pitch isolation of 256 Mbit DRAM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/524628/","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 May-2 Jun 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5205268","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"31 May-2 June 1995","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"A comparative study of LOCOS-type isolations for 256 Mbit DRAM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparative study of LOCOS-type isolations for 256 Mbit DRAM","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00524628.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040759S","chronDate":"31 May-2 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4008","citationCount":"1","articleId":"524628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":524641,"authors":[{"name":"H.H.

Previously we established the link formation and link failure models. According to these models the link formation is due to the melting of electrodes at the highest temperature area. Also, the switch-off phenomenon has been explained as the melting of the conductive link caused by joule heating of the link. Detail mathematical treatment has been presented here and the theory shows good agreement with the experimental data. Furthermore, the WLR method of determining the lifetime of unprogrammed and programmed antifuses has been presented.

Possession of a card by an authorised person has been the traditional approach to high security access control. These cards range from simple magnetic swipe cards through to proximity smart cards for identification. More recently, serious attempts have been made to identify appropriate biometric characteristics of individuals to provide positive identification. The more popular biometric access control techniques have included facial images, hand geometry, fingerprints and retina patterns. Also, the dynamics of keyboard input, handwritten signature and voice patterns have been reasonably successful in identifying authorised persons. This paper describes research that has been undertaken by the authors to use the subcutaneous vascular network (vein pattern) of the back of the hand as a unique personal biometric for identification. An outline will be given of a prototype low cost automatic thermographic imaging system which has been developed by the authors to obtain vein patterns for positive identification. The paper includes consideration of the image acquisition, image processing and vein pattern matching strategies.

By using two counteracting forces, one performing gradient search in the primal space (of the original variables) and the other in the dual space (of the Lagrangian variables), we show that our search algorithm does not get trapped in local minima and reaches equilibrium only when a feasible assignment to the original problem is found. We present experimental results comparing our method with backtracking and local search (based on random restarts). Our results show that 0-1 ILPF problems of reasonable sizes can be solved by an order of magnitude faster than existing methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Nineteenth Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC'95)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4006/11521/00524774.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"161","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Nineteenth Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC'95)","doi":"10.1109/CMPSAC.1995.524774","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMPSAC.1995.524774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=524774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lagrangian techniques for solving a class of zero-one integer linear programs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lagrangian functions","Integer linear programming","Search methods","Computer applications","Application software","Simulated annealing","Genetic algorithms","Minimization methods","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer programming","linear programming","backtracking","search problems","constraint handling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Lagrangian techniques","zero-one integer linear programs","zero-one integer programming feasibility problems","binary variables","gradient search","dual space","primal space","search algorithm","backtracking","local search"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/524774/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"Lagrangian techniques for solving a class of zero-one integer linear programs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5100734","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-11 Aug. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lagrangian techniques for solving a class of zero-one integer linear programs","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00524774.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047691S","chronDate":"9-11 Aug 1995","isNumber":"11521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4006","citationCount":"3","articleId":"524774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":524849,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Moreover, multicasting is needed as there are usually more than two peers who communicate together using multimedia applications. As for the routing, the network has to find an optimum (least cost) multicast route, that has enough resources to provide or guarantee the required QoS. This problem is called QoS constrained multicast routing and was proved to be an NP-complete problem. In contrast to the existing heuristic approaches, in this paper we propose a modified version of a Hopfield neural network model to solve QoS (delay) constrained multicast routing. By the massive parallel computation of neural networks, it can find a near optimal multicast route very fast, when implemented in hardware. Simulation results show that the proposed model has performance near to the optimal solution and comparable to existing heuristics.","doi":"10.1109/ICNP.1995.524849","startPage":"332","endPage":"339","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Network Protocols","pdfPath":"/iel3/4039/11585/00524849.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Network Protocols","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNP.1995.524849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11585","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network approach to multicast routing in real-time communication networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Routing","Quality of service","Communication networks","Multimedia communication","Cost function","NP-complete problem","Hopfield neural networks","Computer networks","Concurrent computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer networks","telecommunication network routing","Hopfield neural nets","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","multicast routing","real-time communication networks","multimedia","QoS","constrained multicast routing","Hopfield neural network model","massive parallel computation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/524849/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov 1995","displayDocTitle":"A neural network approach to multicast routing in real-time communication networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 1995","accessionNumber":"5218476","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network approach to multicast routing in real-time communication networks","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00524849.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045256S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov 1995","isNumber":"11585","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4039","citationCount":"13","articleId":"524849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":524892,"authors":[{"name":"M.

At the same time the facilities should be extendible to people from different facets of life. The present infrastructure is not ready to assimilate such enormously big and divergent elements under a single framework. Flexible computing environment is a step towards defining and implementing such an environment. The main problem is the adaptation of the different elements to changes.

The utility of the CMAC NN in controlling a nonlinear system with unknown dynamics is demonstrated through numerical examples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/525048/","accessionNumber":"5106432","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Control of unknown nonlinear dynamical systems using CMAC neural networks: structure, stability, and passivity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of unknown nonlinear dynamical systems using CMAC neural networks: structure, stability, and passivity","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00525048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026987S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug 1995","isNumber":"11509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3999","citationCount":"15","articleId":"525048","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":525049,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The aim of the implemented controller is to provide consistent inspection performance while using machine vision for automated inspection of dishes in large commercial dish washing operations. With no dynamic model available for camera performance, FLC is implemented using the histogram of a multiple gray level vision target to control the vision parameters \"gain\" and \"offset\" to yield desired minimum and maximum gray levels of the target. The second layer of a two-layer FLC is used to partition the ZERO fuzzy set of the first layer into three subsets, which results in reduced oscillations of the system output. It is shown through experimental studies that the multilayer FLC performs well in controlling vision parameters. The multilayer FLC yields faster response with less overshoot than that of a conventional single layer FLC, and provides excellent camera performance.","doi":"10.1109/ISIC.1995.525079","startPage":"332","endPage":"337","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Tenth International Symposium on Intelligent Control","pdfPath":"/iel3/3999/11509/00525079.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Tenth International Symposium on Intelligent Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIC.1995.525079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11509","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy logic controller for automatic vision parameter adjustment in a robotic dish handling system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy logic","Automatic control","Nonhomogeneous media","Robot vision systems","Cameras","Inspection","MIMO","Lighting control","Control systems","Fluctuations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["materials handling","surface cleaning","manipulators","catering industry","fuzzy control","robot vision","optical variables control","gain control","MIMO systems","multivariable control systems","automatic optical inspection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer MIMO fuzzy logic controller","automatic vision parameter adjustment","robotic dish handling system","vision parameter adjustment","gain adjustment","offset adjustment","threshold adjustment","machine-vision based integrated robotic dish handling system","commercial dish washing operations","histogram","multiple gray level vision target","ZERO fuzzy set partition","vision parameter control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/525079/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy logic controller for automatic vision parameter adjustment in a robotic dish handling system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5106463","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy logic controller for automatic vision parameter adjustment in a robotic dish handling system","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00525079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048225S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug 1995","isNumber":"11509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3999","citationCount":"3","articleId":"525079","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":525083,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Each robots is a mobile processor that, at each discrete time instant, observes the relative positions of those robots that are within distance V of itself, computes its new position using the given algorithm, and then moves to that position. The main difference between this work and many of the previous ones is that, here, the visibility of the robots is assumed to be limited to within distance V, for some constant V>0. The problems the authors discuss include the formation of a single point by the robots and agreement on a common x-y coordinate system and the initial distribution, and they present algorithms for these problems, except for the problem of agreement on direction (a subproblem of agreement on a coordinate system), which is not solvable even for robots with unlimited visibility. The discussions the authors present indicate that the correctness proofs of the algorithms for robots with limited visibility can be considerably more complex than those for robots with unlimited visibility.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/525098/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug 1995","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5106482","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Formation and agreement problems for synchronous mobile robots with limited visibility","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Formation and agreement problems for synchronous mobile robots with limited visibility","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00525098.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034243S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug 1995","isNumber":"11509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3999","citationCount":"59","articleId":"525098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":525105,"authors":[{"name":"W.K.

They were introduced in 1993 by Berrou, Glavieux and Thitimajshima, and claimed to achieve near Shannon-limit error correction performance with relatively simple component codes and large interleavers. A required E/sub b//N/sub o/ of 0.7 dB was reported for BER of 10/sup -5/ and code rate of 1/2. However, some important details that are necessary to reproduce these results were omitted. This paper confirms the accuracy of these claims, and presents a complete description of an encoder/decoder pair that could be suitable for PCS applications. We describe a new simple method for trellis termination, we analyze the effect of interleaver choice on the weight distribution of the code, and we introduce the use of unequal rate component codes which yields better performance. Turbo codes are extended to encoders with multiple codes and a suitable decoder structure is developed, which is substantially different from the decoder for two-code based encoders.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1995.525138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1995.525138","startPage":"54","endPage":"59 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Communications ICC '95","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Communications ICC '95","pdfPath":"/iel3/3942/11415/00525138.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turbo codes for PCS applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/525138/","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Turbo codes for PCS applications","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5188383","publicationDate":"1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbo codes for PCS applications","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00525138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031893S","chronDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3942","citationCount":"262","articleId":"525138","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":525166,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

Our approach employs an adaptive rate based feedback control algorithm using reinforcement learning neural networks (NNs). The reinforcement learning NN controller provides an adaptive optimal control solution. This is achieved via the formulation of a performance measure function (cost function) that is used to, adaptively, tune the weights of the NN. The cost function is defined in terms of two main objectives: (1) to minimize the cell loss rate (CLR), i.e., control congestion and (2) to preserve the quality of the voice/video traffic via maintaining the original coding rate of the multimedia sources. The results show that the NN control system is adaptive in the sense that it is applicable to any type of multimedia traffic. Also, the control signal is optimal in the sense that it maximizes the performance of the system which is defined in terms of its performance measure function. Hence, our novel approach is very effective in controlling the congestion of multimedia traffic in ATM networks.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1995.525166","startPage":"206","endPage":"210 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Communications ICC '95","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1995.525166","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11415","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Communications ICC '95","pdfPath":"/iel3/3942/11415/00525166.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Congestion control mechanism for ATM networks using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/525166/","displayDocTitle":"Congestion control mechanism for ATM networks using neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5188411","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Congestion control mechanism for ATM networks using neural networks","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00525166.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035618S","chronDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3942","citationCount":"15","articleId":"525166","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":525168,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Its main characteristics are that only one user transmits over the entire bandwidth at any particular time instant and that the users are allocated more power when their channels are good, and less when they are bad. Moreover, these features are independent of the statistics of the fading. Numerical results are presented for the case of single-path Rayleigh fading. We show that an increase in capacity over a perfectly-power controlled (Gaussian) channel can be achieved, especially if the number of users is large. By examining the bit error-rate with antipodal signalling, we show the inherent diversity in multiuser communications over fading channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/525188/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5188434","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Information capacity and power control in single-cell multiuser communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information capacity and power control in single-cell multiuser communications","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00525188.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026102S","chronDate":"18-22 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3942","citationCount":"1433","articleId":"525188","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":525191,"authors":[{"name":"C.S.

The energy-based neural network that have been proposed to solve this problem usually take a long time to converge to solutions. The authors previously (1994) proposed a new neural model which needs no special convergence procedure and can find optimal or near-optimal solutions of the problem at a much faster speed. However, in this model as well as other energy-based models, the number of neurons are proportional to the lot sizes of the jobs. This may complicate the implementation. In this paper, we extend our model to solve this problem. In this extended model, the number of neurons are fixed for different lot sizes. These results are quite good in terms of quality and speed. Furthermore, in this new model, mn(n+7) number of neurons are needed to solve an n-job m-machine problem with an arbitrary lot size for each job.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1995.525286","startPage":"202","endPage":"207 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel3/3951/11429/00525286.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1995.525286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network model for the job-shop scheduling problem with the consideration of lot sizes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Job shop scheduling","Neurons","Oceans","Shortest path problem","Manufacturing systems","Scheduling algorithm","Power generation economics","Robotics and automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scheduling","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network model","job-shop scheduling problem","lot sizes","job batch sizes","energy-based neural network","near-optimal solutions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/525286/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-27 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"A neural network model for the job-shop scheduling problem with the consideration of lot sizes","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-27 May 1995","accessionNumber":"5085874","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network model for the job-shop scheduling problem with the consideration of lot sizes","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00525286.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047034S","chronDate":"21-27 May 1995","isNumber":"11429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3951","citationCount":"4","articleId":"525286","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":525308,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The control system proposed is based on the impedance control with virtual internal models (VIMs) driven by the sum of two forces detected on a master and a slave. The sufficient condition for the stability with arbitrary time delay is given based on small gain theorem. The sufficient condition can be satisfied by choosing appropriate parameters of the VIMs. Consequently, the control system is stable under any time delay. The proposed control system is applied to an experimental teleoperation system, which consists of two manipulators different in size. Data for teleoperation are transmitted through wireless LAN (256 kbps, max.). With this system, a stable contact task (to teach a desired position of the slave) was accomplished even with the time delay of 0.5 second. And it has been experimentally verified that the system is stable when time delay varies at random or when data transmission ceases and resumes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/525308/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-27 May 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5085896","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-27 May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Bilateral telemanipulator system with communication time delay based on force-sum-driven virtual internal models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bilateral telemanipulator system with communication time delay based on force-sum-driven virtual internal models","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00525308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041362S","chronDate":"21-27 May 1995","isNumber":"11429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3951","citationCount":"20","articleId":"525308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":525322,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Deformation of these objects is often utilized in order to manipulate them successfully while the manipulation sometimes fails because of unexpected deformation of the objects. Modeling of deformable objects is thus required so that the shape of the objects can be evaluated on a computer in advance. In this paper, we develop an analytical method to model the shape of a deformable linear object such as cords and tubes. First, a geometric representation to describe the shape of a linear object with bending and torsional deformation is introduced. The potential energy of the object and the geometric constraints imposed on it are then formulated. The shape of the object in the stable state can be derived by minimizing the potential energy under the geometric constraints. Next, procedure to compute the deformed shape is developed by applying a nonlinear programming technique. Finally, some numerical examples are shown in order to demonstrate how deformed shapes of linear objects are computed using the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1995.525322","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel3/3951/11429/00525322.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1995.525322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11429","startPage":"433","endPage":"438 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of linear objects considering bend, twist, and extensional deformations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=525322","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of linear objects considering bend, twist, and extensional deformations","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-27 May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/525322/","conferenceDate":"21-27 May 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5085909","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of linear objects considering bend, twist, and extensional deformations","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00525322.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031491S","chronDate":"21-27 May 1995","isNumber":"11429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3951","citationCount":"32","articleId":"525322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":525342,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

The \"Mercury Project\" consists of an industrial robot arm fitted with a CCD camera and a pneumatic system. We placed a sandbox filled with buried artifacts in the robot workspace.

This approach has major implications in terms of cost, size, and power consumption. Other methods have involved sub-sampling an image to reduce cost and complexity. This has the disadvantage of information loss. We present a low cost, low powered, reduced complexity vision system capable of intelligently sampling an image to reduce this information loss. The design philosophy and methodology is discussed, along with sample applications. Primarily we demonstrate how the reduced complexity vision system will be used to aid in navigation of an autonomous flying vehicle. This is quantified by showing how having multiple sampling schemes result in increased robustness and accuracy of our helicopter line tracking algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1995.525377","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel3/3951/11429/00525377.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1995.525377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11429","startPage":"776","endPage":"780 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A reduced complexity vision system for autonomous helicopter navigation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=525377","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A reduced complexity vision system for autonomous helicopter navigation","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-27 May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/525377/","conferenceDate":"21-27 May 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5085964","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A reduced complexity vision system for autonomous helicopter navigation","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00525377.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036972S","chronDate":"21-27 May 1995","isNumber":"11429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3951","citationCount":"3","articleId":"525377","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":525384,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The geometric modeling module employs the restricted Coulomb energy (RCE) paradigm to describe the spatial occupancy of a 3-D object by a number of overlapping spheres. The collision detection module receives the geometric pattern in the robot's environment and updates the spherical representation to perform geometric computation for existence of interference. The decision support module, using neural networks, provides online information for the collision detection module. A PUMA 560 robot's CAD model was built to test the scheme.

A two-stage control scheme consisting of a motion controller and a joint torque controller is established in a systematic way for the general n-link case. To deal with uncertainties in the robotic system, a robust adaptive control algorithm is developed assuming that all system parameters including the joint flexibility values are unknown except for some of their bounds. The system stability is analyzed via Lyapunov stability theory. The result has the distinct feature that no restriction of joint flexibility, nor exact knowledge of the parameters of rotor subsystem is required. The outcome is a useful framework for generalization of control methods previously developed for rigid robots. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel3/3951/11429/00525448.pdf","startPage":"1229","endPage":"1234 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1995.525448","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1995.525448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11429","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=525448","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust adaptive control of flexible joint robots with joint torque feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Adaptive control","Robots","Motion control","Torque control","Control systems","Manipulators","Feedback","Uncertainty","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","motion control","robust control","manipulators","flexible structures","torque control","Lyapunov methods","feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust adaptive control","flexible joint robots","joint torque feedback","motion control","two-stage control scheme","uncertainties","Lyapunov stability theory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/525448/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-27 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Robust adaptive control of flexible joint robots with joint torque feedback","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5086035","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-27 May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust adaptive control of flexible joint robots with joint torque feedback","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00525448.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035329S","chronDate":"21-27 May 1995","isNumber":"11429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3951","citationCount":"25","articleId":"525448","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":525485,"authors":[{"name":"E.M.

Delaunay triangulation provides a good criteria for constructing a continuous linear approximation to the true function from neighborhood points of the query. For comparison purposes we solve the same problem with a neural network trained with error backpropagation.

A neural net can be trained to exhibit such a behaviour. The advantage is that, it relates the desired motion directly to the sensor inputs, obviating the need of modeling and planning. In this work, a feedforward neural net is trained to output reactive motion, in response to sonar range inputs, with data generated artificially on the computer screen. The authors develop input and output representations appropriate to this problem. A reactive robot, being totally insensitive to context, often gets trapped in oscillations in front of a wide object. To overcome this problem, the authors introduce a notion of memory into the network by including context units at the input layer. The authors discuss the mode of training for such a network and present simulated runs of the trained net in various situations. The authors conclude by demonstrating a short tour of an actual mobile robot in their laboratory under the control of the trained neural net.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1995.525488","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel3/3951/11430/00525488.pdf","startPage":"1503","endPage":"1508 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1995.525488","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11430","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile robot navigation using a neural net","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=525488","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-27 May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/525488/","displayDocTitle":"Mobile robot navigation using a neural net","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5087838","conferenceDate":"21-27 May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile robot navigation using a neural net","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00525488.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04316S","chronDate":"21-27 May 1995","isNumber":"11430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3951","citationCount":"12","articleId":"525488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":525508,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The advantage of such a control paradigm is the ability to manipulate in both unconstrained and constrained environments. Unlike hybrid control methods that attempt to control forces and motions in orthogonal directions, impedance control consists of a single control law that accommodates external forces. One problem associated with such a controller is the selection of the robot's target impedance. This paper illustrates, through analysis and experimentation, the shortcoming of improper target impedance selection. The integration of a real time estimate of the robot's environment with the impedance controller resolves this problem.

A displacement sensor and a force/torque sensor are introduced to measure vibration. Based on the proposed neural network controller, which employs the feedback error learning method as the basic control architecture, this paper deals with the spillover effect to asymptotic convergence of learning. The conditions for asymptotic convergence of feedback error learning method for each trials are obtained. The influence of the vibration modes unmodeled on the conditions for asymptotic convergence is discussed. Based on the results obtained here, we present a new learning method to improve the control performance. The control system consists of a low pass filter and two neural networks. The learning method is to change the learning rate according to the convergence conditions. From simulation results, we show that the tracking performance is improved by using proposed learning method.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1995.525580","startPage":"2162","endPage":"2167 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel3/3951/11430/00525580.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1995.525580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11430","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network controller for flexible plate considering spillover effect on learning process","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Learning systems","Convergence","Force measurement","Vibration measurement","Neurofeedback","Robot sensing systems","Manipulators","Force sensors","Displacement measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["manipulators","neurocontrollers","displacement control","force control","torque control","vibration control","feedback","learning (artificial intelligence)","intelligent control","low-pass filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network controller","flexible plate handling","learning process","noncontact sensing","robotic manipulator","displacement sensor","force/torque sensor","vibration control","feedback error learning","spillover effect","asymptotic convergence","low pass filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/525580/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-27 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Neural network controller for flexible plate considering spillover effect on learning process","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-27 May 1995","accessionNumber":"5094278","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network controller for flexible plate considering spillover effect on learning process","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00525580.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03185S","chronDate":"21-27 May 1995","isNumber":"11430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3951","citationCount":"2","articleId":"525580","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":525592,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Equally important, factors such as labor shortages and reduced work hours are expected to become more of an issue in the coming years. It is extremely important, therefore, to address the qualitative and quantitative issues of labor in the design and manufacturing aspects of the assembly line, as well as the issue of the assembly operators themselves. To address these issues, we have developed and put into practical use a multi-arm type assembly robot capable of handling complex and both-hands assembly operations.

The developed robot has the following functions to perform such a security service: autonomous navigation, master-slave manipulation system with force feedback, a remotely operated camera vision system with wide and stereoscopic view modes. The experiments conducted with the robot show that the robot can navigate autonomously in simple environments with a maximum speed of 1 m/s.

A new scheme, named the \"linear inverted pendulum mode\" is utilized for controlling biped walking on rugged terrain. We developed a 6 d.o.f. biped robot \"Meltran II\" which has light weight legs and moves in a two dimensional vertical plane. To check the effects not well discussed in the theory, we carried out two experiments, the support phase experiment and the support exchange experiment. The support phase experiment was carried out to check the actual dynamics of biped walking when using the proposed control. It was shown that the dynamics of the robot can be regarded as linear even though the mass of the legs, which was neglected in the theory, exists, The support exchange experiment was performed to check leg support exchange. We found that a smooth leg support exchange is achieved by making the foot contact with a certain vertical speed and holding two leg support for a certain short period. Based on these results, a whole biped control system was implemented. In our experiment the robot walked over a box of 3.5 cm height at a speed of 20 cm/s.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1995.525693","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel3/3951/11431/00525693.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1995.525693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11431","startPage":"2885","endPage":"2891 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental study of biped dynamic walking in the linear inverted pendulum mode","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=525693","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Experimental study of biped dynamic walking in the linear inverted pendulum mode","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-27 May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/525693/","conferenceDate":"21-27 May 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5094314","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental study of biped dynamic walking in the linear inverted pendulum mode","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00525693.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0727S","chronDate":"21-27 May 1995","isNumber":"11431","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3951","citationCount":"79","articleId":"525693","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":525715,"authors":[{"name":"P.O.

In experimental applications, noise on position and torque measurements, friction modeling error and bad excitation restrict dramatically the identification. This paper presents a methodology to overcome these difficulties. The proposed identification method is based on experiments which are designed by means of physical interpretation and spectrum analysis of the robot dynamic model in order to reduce sensitivity to noise. These experiments are planned in order to ensure optimal condition number of the observation matrix. The proposed algorithms have been integrated in a software package called Robot Identification Software Tool (RIST). The successful application of this new method to a 3 degrees of freedom robot proves the efficiency of the algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel3/3951/11431/00525715.pdf","startPage":"3033","endPage":"3038 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1995.525715","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1995.525715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11431","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=525715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of robots inertial parameters by means of spectrum analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robotics and automation","Manipulator dynamics","Friction","Robot sensing systems","Parameter estimation","Noise reduction","Software algorithms","Torque control","Least squares methods","Torque measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noise","parameter estimation","least squares approximations","spectral analysis","robot dynamics","software packages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inertial parameters","spectrum analysis","robots","linear model","base parameters","standard least squares techniques","torque measurements","position measurements","friction modeling error","bad excitation","identification method","robot dynamic model","optimal condition number","observation matrix","software package","Robot Identification Software Tool","3 degrees of freedom robot"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/525715/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-27 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Identification of robots inertial parameters by means of spectrum analysis","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5094336","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-27 May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of robots inertial parameters by means of spectrum analysis","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00525715.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055152S","chronDate":"21-27 May 1995","isNumber":"11431","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3951","citationCount":"9","articleId":"525715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":525724,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Kinetic Sciences Inc. has developed a hybrid electric-pneumatic tentacular robot called the KSI tentacle manipulator. It has variable compliance, can bend independently in two or more regions, and can extend to more than five times its contracted length. In total, the Tentacle has six degrees of freedom-or seven with the addition of a distal wrist-rotate joint. The Tentacle's unusual kinematics and inherent compliance demand new approaches to control. Three schemes are considered here: joystick-based teleoperation, inverse kinematics-based tendon length control, and machine vision-based fine position control. Under control, the Tentacle has broad potential in many applications, including teleoperated vacuuming and spray washing (for nuclear hot cell decontamination), general materials handling, agricultural harvesting, robotic refueling, and endoscopy.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel3/3951/11431/00525733.pdf","startPage":"3149","endPage":"3154 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1995.525733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1995.525733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11431","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=525733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The KSI tentacle manipulator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Manipulators","Arm","Kinetic theory","Kinematics","Tendons","Position control","Spraying","Decontamination","Materials handling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["manipulators","flexible structures","kinematics","materials handling","telerobotics","compliance control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tentacle manipulator","Kinetic Sciences","electric-pneumatic tentacular robot","distal wrist-rotate joint","kinematics","joystick-based teleoperation","inverse kinematics-based tendon length control","machine vision-based position control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/525733/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-27 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"The KSI tentacle manipulator","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5094354","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-27 May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The KSI tentacle manipulator","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"00525733.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038856S","chronDate":"21-27 May 1995","isNumber":"11431","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3951","citationCount":"87","articleId":"525733","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":525800,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Based on the discussion on sensing and communication for cooperative multiple mobile robots, requirements for the sensory system are derived. Then, the infra-red sensory system is designed and developed taking account of the required function.

The maps, described with respect to the robot's inertial frame, are developed in real time by correlating robot position and sensory data. This latter feature characterizes part of the uniqueness of the authors' approach. These maps are topologically isomorphic to the maps created for the same room(s) by humans. The methodology exploits the principle of self-organization, implemented as an artificial neural network module which processes incoming sensor range data. The generation of environmental maps can be visualized as an elastic string of neurons whereby every neuron represents a finite portion of the physical world. This elastic string stretches dynamically so as to take on the shape of the environment, a unique characteristic of the authors' methodology. In this respect, the neural net provides a discretized representation of the \"continuous\" physical environment as the latter is seen through the robot's own sensors. Experiments, focused on indoor applications, have successfully demonstrated the ability of a robot to build maps of geometrically complex environments. The results presented in this paper, compared with the authors' earlier efforts, show significant improvement in that every single sensor data point contributes equally to the location of the neurons of the spatial map at the end of the learning process. This is important because the authors wish to minimize the effect of the order in which data points are processed.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.1995.525808","startPage":"277","endPage":"284 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1995 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.

Despite this tradition, reducing interface stiffness offers a number of advantages, including greater shock tolerance, lower reflected inertia, more accurate and stable force control, less inadvertent damage to the environment, and the capacity for energy storage. As a trade-off, reducing interface stiffness also lowers zero motion force bandwidth. In this paper, the authors propose that for natural tasks, zero motion force bandwidth isn't everything, and incorporating series elasticity as a purposeful element within the actuator is a good idea. The authors use the term elasticity instead of compliance to indicate the presence of a passive mechanical spring in the actuator. After a discussion of the trade-offs inherent in series elastic actuators, the authors present a control system for their use under general force or impedance control. The authors conclude with test results from a revolute series-elastic actuator meant for the arms of the MIT humanoid robot Cog and for a small planetary rover.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Aug 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/525827/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5094160","conferenceDate":"5-9 Aug. 1995","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Series elastic actuators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Series elastic actuators","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00525827.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038806S","chronDate":"5-9 Aug 1995","isNumber":"11432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3952","citationCount":"1087","articleId":"525827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":525868,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Applications include training doctors to use tools during surgery, and training astronauts to use tools during EVA. This paper describes some of the challenges of creating realistic haptic perceptions of tool use. Many of these challenges stem from the importance of unilateral constraints during tool use. Unilateral constraints occur whenever rigid bodies collide, resisting the interpenetration of the bodies, but not holding the bodies together. To identify unilateral constraints, a tool/environment simulation must perform collision detection. To respond properly to a collision, the simulation must estimate the forces that ensue, and integrate the equations of motion. All of these computations must occur in real time, and the simulation as a whole must be stable (to ensure the user's safety). Approaches to these problems are described.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.1995.525875","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1995 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.

Such skill models, however, can be used not only for transferring human control strategy to robots, but also for helping less-skilled human operators improve their performance. The authors propose a two-step approach for transferring skill from human expert to human apprentice. An expert's relevant control strategies or skills are first abstracted into a sensory-based computational model. Afterwards, this trained computational model is used to generate on-line advice for less-skilled operators who need to improve their skill. This advice can take advantage of many different sensor modalities, thereby potentially improving both the quality and speed of learning for the apprentice. Furthermore, this approach allows for the efficient transfer of skill from a single expert to many apprentices, as well as from many experts to a single apprentice. In this paper, the authors first describe a flexible neural-network-based method for modeling human control strategy and provide motivation for its use. The authors then present a case study for teaching control strategy from one person to another in this two-step approach of transferring skill.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.1995.525902","startPage":"314","endPage":"319 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1995 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.

It has been shown that the problem of tracking a specified reference trajectory and specified force profile with a preset quality of their transient response can be efficiently solved by means of application of the four-layer perceptron.

The algorithm is able to find the pseudonoise (PN) code delay estimates for the RAKE branches in a multipath fading channel.

Variations in the process output are classified as the drift and the shift. The drift is caused by a natural noise that changes over a period of time slowly and steadily partly due to the aging of equipment. Although the drift moves the process output away from the target value, its variation is infinitesimal. On the other hand, the shift results in a larger variation due to the various causes and its width is normally greater than that of the drift. Without appropriate procedures, the process output will move away from the target value greatly. Therefore the control strategy is to minimize the process shifts, in which process outputs are measured by monitoring wafers periodically.","doi":"10.1109/IEMT.1995.526118","startPage":"218","endPage":"223","publicationTitle":"Seventeenth IEEE/CPMT International Electronics Manufacturing Technology Symposium.

These adhesive forces arise primarily from surface tension, Van der Waals, and electrostatic attractions and can be a fundamental limitation to part handling in a gas environment. While it is possible to fabricate miniature versions of conventional robot grippers, for example from polysilicon, it appears that it will be difficult to overcome adhesion effects for the smallest parts.

The authors propose an approach based on geometrical interaction between a sensor and an environment, this approach is enlarged with Gaussian approximation to take into account the measurement noise. The Bayes reasoning allows one to estimate the information given by the multi-sensor system for a given scene. Our model takes into account the number of use of each sensor. This characteristic interests us in two ways: it is possible to discard useless sensors, and it is possible to estimate the acquisition delay for a given multi-sensor system site. With this approach, we propose a quadratic criterion which is able to describe the distance between the desired information and an available information. The effectiveness of this procedure is illustrated with an example of application concerning the sensor placement problem.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.1995.526271","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1995 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.

The first pertains to the family of feedforward neural networks with temporal recurrent elements added to the neurons. This structure allows memory neuron networks to identify systems without having to feed past inputs and outputs explicitly. The second ANN is recurrent Its architecture looks like a discrete state-space system with a sigmoidal function in the recurrent loop. The main attraction of this three-layer recurrent neural network is its simplicity of use and the faster speed of convergence of the learning phase. The two ANNs have been tested on two dynamical systems, a fifth-order discrete theoretical plant with many multiplications between internal states in order to introduce nonlinearities, and a nonlinear transfer function from the terminal voltage to the magnetizing flux in a power transformer The challenge the ANNs is to catch the ferroresonance phenomenon as seen from the primary of the set-up transformer after a fault. The performance of these ANNs is discussed in light of various aspects of their utilisation. The comparison is based on important points such as difficulties of use, their speed and ability to converge, and their ability to generalize the behaviour of the system to inputs not available for training.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1995.526278","pdfPath":"/iel3/4014/11532/00526278.pdf","startPage":"606","endPage":"612 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1995 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1995 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.1995.526278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11532","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applications of artificial neural networks to the identification of dynamical systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/526278/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Applications of artificial neural networks to the identification of dynamical systems","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5205320","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications of artificial neural networks to the identification of dynamical systems","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00526278.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053757S","chronDate":"5-8 Sep 1995","isNumber":"11532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4014","citationCount":"2","articleId":"526278","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":526280,"authors":[{"name":"Weichun Yu","affiliation":["Centre for Industrial control, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"lastName":"Weichun Yu","id":"37087761527"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2766-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"526280","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":41},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear systems","Recurrent neural networks","Neurons","Artificial neural networks","Multi-layer neural network","Neurofeedback","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Neural networks","Industrial control","Mechanical engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear dynamical systems","modelling","feedforward neural nets","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear dynamical systems","modelling","feedforward neural network","recurrent neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=526280","abstract":"Two types of artificial neural networks are studied in this paper in modelling nonlinear dynamical systems: a feedforward neural network and a recurrent neural network.

Suitable number of past inputs and outputs depends on the assumption on model structure. For the recurrent network with a hybrid (feedforward and feedback) structure, explicit use of past inputs and outputs is not necessary for modelling since their effects are captured by the network internal states.

Two fully interconnected feed-forward multilayered neural networks with necessary layers trained by back-propagation supervised learning algorithm using the min-max amplitude ranges of the output signals of UWLM are designed and evaluated. These are based on synthetic data, to estimate the parameters of the media including attenuation factors, reflection coefficients, travel times and decay values. Based on experiments estimating the parameters of the media and predicting its output signal, the networks produce results very close to those of the original assumed media structure The results suggest that the proposed networks can supplement, or replace conventional techniques for parameter estimation and output prediction in system identification. The method presented also offers advantages in speed and efficiency over existing estimates techniques.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1995.526281","pdfPath":"/iel3/4014/11532/00526281.pdf","startPage":"621","endPage":"626 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1995 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1995 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.1995.526281","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11532","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Underwater signal prediction and parameter estimation using artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/526281/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Underwater signal prediction and parameter estimation using artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5212035","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Underwater signal prediction and parameter estimation using artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00526281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047588S","chronDate":"5-8 Sep 1995","isNumber":"11532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4014","citationCount":"1","articleId":"526281","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":526286,"authors":[{"name":"T.

An input LC filter is required to suppress the current harmonics injected into AC mains. The input filter affects the input displacement factor (IDF) of the system, which varies with the rectifier operating point and may result in unacceptable low values. In this paper, closed-loop control of the input line currents is proposed to achieve near unity IDF independent of the load conditions. The current reference template is generated from the filter capacitor voltages, the need for damping resistors is eliminated and efficiency is increased. The output DC current is regulated by varying the amplitudes of the current references. The proposed scheme features good steady state results, fast transient response and higher efficiency. The paper includes analysis, a design example and simulation results for steady state and transient conditions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11532","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.1995.526594","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1995 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1995 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/4014/11532/00526594.pdf","startPage":"987","endPage":"990 vol.2","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1995.526594","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A current controlled near unity power factor three-phase PWM buck rectifier without passive damping requirements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"A current controlled near unity power factor three-phase PWM buck rectifier without passive damping requirements","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 1995","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5205407","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/526594/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A current controlled near unity power factor three-phase PWM buck rectifier without passive damping requirements","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00526594.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024733S","chronDate":"5-8 Sep 1995","isNumber":"11532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4014","citationCount":"1","articleId":"526594","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":526597,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada"],"lastName":"Fang Wang","id":"37087180114"},{"name":"Q.J.

This paper focuses on the computational constraints of the minimal realization algorithm (time and memory requirements) applied to such huge systems. It also discusses comparative results demonstrating the tradeoffs in identification accuracy using different algorithmic settings. A scalar metric is suggested, which allows quantitative assessment of the precision of the state matrices (a,b,c,d). The best settings are then selected by minimizing this performance measure, keeping in mind the associated computational cost. From the system matrices (a,b,c,d), the authors derive several types of very promising numerical tools, including controllability and observability measures, which illustrate the system natural frequencies and damping as well as the contribution of the hydraulic power plants to common and local modes dynamics.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1995 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/4014/11532/00526622.pdf","startPage":"1102","endPage":"1106 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1995 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1995.526622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.1995.526622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11532","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=526622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experience with the minimal realization approach identifying large MIMO system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse power systems","Power generation","Power system transients","Power system stability","Power system modeling","MIMO","Pulse generation","Computational efficiency","Controllability","Observability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system state estimation","state-space methods","observability","MIMO systems","matrix algebra","transient response","frequency-domain analysis","power system control","power system stability","power system transients","controllability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimal realization approach","large MIMO system identification","state-space identification technique","impulse responses","transient stability program","large power system","minimal realization algorithm","algorithmic settings","computational cost","system matrices","controllability","observability","natural frequencies","damping","hydraulic power plants","local modes dynamics","common dynamics","frequency domain analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/526622/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 1995","displayDocTitle":"Experience with the minimal realization approach identifying large MIMO system","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5218862","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experience with the minimal realization approach identifying large MIMO system","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00526622.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031538S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 1995","isNumber":"11532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4014","citationCount":"2","articleId":"526622","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":526664,"authors":[{"name":"N.

We also establish a result for differential inclusions which is analogous to invariance theory type results for differential equations. To demonstrate applicability, we use the above results in the analysis of the absolute stability problem of regulator systems with multinonlinearities and time delays. Also, we apply the above results in the stability analysis of operating points (equilibria) of a class of integrated circuits with time delays, with an emphasis on a class of artificial neural networks for associative memories. In the applications, we reduce the stability problem of some given nonlinear systems with time delays to the stability problem of a finite number of linear systems with time delays.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/526677/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","volume":"43","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5367230","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Stability analysis of differential inclusions in Banach space with applications to nonlinear systems with time delays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability analysis of differential inclusions in Banach space with applications to nonlinear systems with time delays","sourcePdf":"00526677.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059458S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"24","articleId":"526677","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":526680,"authors":[{"name":"S.H.

The combinatorial minimization of the detection cost Is performed through the optimization of a concave Lyapunov function associated with the network, and truly paralleled operations can be achieved via the collective computational behaviors. In addition, the MLSE performance can be improved by a paralleled annealing technique which has been developed for obtaining optimal or near-optimal solutions in high-speed, real-time applications. Given a sequence of length n, the network of complexity and throughput rate are O(L) and n/T/sub c/, respectively, where L is the number of symbols the inference spans and T/sub c/ is the convergence time. The hardware architecture as well as network models, neuron models, and methods of feeding the input to the network are addressed in terms of the probability of error. Through the simulations, it is demonstrated that the proposed compact neural network approach is an efficient method of realizing the MLSE receiver.","doi":"10.1109/81.526680","startPage":"644","endPage":"655","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/11189/00526680.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.526680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network for detection of signals in communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Signal detection","Maximum likelihood estimation","Maximum likelihood detection","Digital communication","Cost function","Lyapunov method","Computer networks","Concurrent computing","Annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital communication","maximum likelihood detection","sequential estimation","neural net architecture","simulated annealing","Lyapunov methods","telecommunication computing","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neuron model","signal detection","maximum-likelihood sequence estimation","digital communications","combinatorial minimization","optimization","concave Lyapunov function","parallel operation","collective computation","parallel annealing","high-speed real-time systems","hardware architecture","error probability","simulation","MLSE receiver","compact neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/526680/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"A neural network for detection of signals in communication","volume":"43","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5367233","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network for detection of signals in communication","sourcePdf":"00526680.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077962S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"21","articleId":"526680","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":526681,"authors":[{"name":"Qicheng Yu","affiliation":["Crystal Semiconductor Corporation, Nashua, NH, USA"],"lastName":"Qicheng Yu","id":"37349952800"},{"name":"C.

It combines two new approximation-during-computation strategies with a variation of the classical two-graph tree enumeration method. The first strategy is to generate common trees of the two-graphs, and therefore the product terms in the symbolic network function, in the decreasing order of magnitude. This is made possible by our algorithm for generating color-constrained spanning trees in the order of weight. It avoids the burden of computing all the product terms only to find most of them numerically negligible. The second approximation strategy is the sensitivity-based simplification of two-graphs, which excludes from the two-graphs many of the insignificant circuit elements that have little effect on the network function being derived. It significantly reduces the complexity of the two-graphs before tree enumeration. Our approach is therefore able to symbolically analyze much larger analog integrated circuits than previously reported, using complete small signal models for the semiconductor devices. We show accurate yet reasonably sized symbolic network functions for integrated circuits with up to 39 transistors whereas previous approaches were limited to less than 15. For even larger circuits, the limit is imposed mainly by the interpretability of the generated symbolic network function.","doi":"10.1109/81.526681","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/11189/00526681.pdf","startPage":"656","endPage":"669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.526681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A unified approach to the approximate symbolic analysis of large analog integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/526681/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"A unified approach to the approximate symbolic analysis of large analog integrated circuits","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5367234","volume":"43","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified approach to the approximate symbolic analysis of large analog integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"00526681.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022055S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"76","articleId":"526681","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":526685,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Using PNN we could make a complimentary linearized controller and then, after starting the learning, in an online manner it will be extended to a nonlinear dominant controller.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Jul 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/526694/","accessionNumber":"5119947","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Controller design using parametric neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Controller design using parametric neural networks","confLoc":"Hokkaido, Japan","sourcePdf":"00526694.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03235S","chronDate":"26-28 Jul 1995","isNumber":"11583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4037","articleId":"526694","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":526696,"authors":[{"name":"A.H.

Scientific research conducted in the oceans and coastal areas could benefit through the reduction of cost for acquisition and downloading of data from remote monitoring sites. Undersea robotics could benefit through improvement of the communications features of manned and unmanned underwater vehicles for control and for near real-time conveyance of data and images. The theoretical formulation of the underwater acoustic data communications problem includes modeling of the stochastic channel to incorporate a variety of impairments and environmental uncertainties; and proposal of compound strategies for parallel data transmission systems using multicarrier modulation (MCM) in a higher-order statistics (HOS) signal processing domain. An MCM system obtains enhanced usage of available bandwidth, as well as higher transmission rate and error threshold in comparison to the single carrier modulation (SCM) type, and thus establishes a faster communication link which is inherently more immune to impulsive type impairments.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1995.526822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11611","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.1995.526822","endPage":"599 vol.1","publicationTitle":"'Challenges of Our Changing Global Environment'.

The first part of the paper discusses the feasibility of using this processing in the sea. We distinguish deep and shallow water cases, short and long range transmissions. Adaptive beamforming or parametric transmission can be used to reduce the channel time-spreading. In the second part we give results obtained by applying the Viterbi algorithm with a self-optimised LMS filter used for channel identification. Through simulations we emphasize the influence of signal-to-noise ratio, channel shape (particularly non-minimum phase one), delays... . One Atlantic (Azores) transmission (60 km range) helped to show the superiority of Viterbi on a linear equalizer (even with adaptive step) processing, due to its ability to follow channel variations (interesting for moving transmitter-receivers).

A study of significant disturbances reported by NERC in the period from 1984 through 1988 indicates that protective relays are involved in one way or another in 75 percent of major disturbances. A common scenario is that the relay has an undetected (hidden) defect that was exposed due to the conditions created by other disturbances. For example, nearby faults, overloads, or reverse power flows expose the defective relay and cause a false trip, which exacerbates the situation. Given the importance of hidden failure modes in traditional relaying systems, intervention by computer-based rational control schemes is proposed in this article.

A framework for developing an integrated regional health telematics system is presented, based on the functional and data integration of federated autonomous information systems. The concept of the patient meta-record is introduced as a central element in achieving integration in terms of content, structure, and access to information resources. Intelligent image management at the level of either a single health care provider (hospital) or a regional health telematics network is addressed and is achieved through event and model-driven strategies enabled by a distributed hierarchical storage management system.

The goal of the design was to increase the computational horsepower available for this problem by about three orders of magnitude under the tight constraints of size, weight and power which are typical of an orbiting satellite. By combining the CORDIC rotation algorithm, systolic array concepts, Givens transformations, and restructurable VLSI, we built a system as small as a package of cigarettes, but capable of the equivalent of almost three billion operations per second. Our work was motivated by the severe limitations of size, weight and power which apply to computation aboard a spacecraft, although the same factors impose costs which are worth reducing in other circumstances. For an array of N antennas, the cost of the adaptive nulling computation grows as N/sup 3/, so simply using more resources when N is large is not practical. The architecture developed, called MUSE (matrix update systolic experiment) determines the nulling weights for N=64 antenna elements in a sidelobe cancelling configuration. After explaining the antenna nulling system, we discuss another DSP computation that might benefit from similar architecture, technology, or algorithms: the solution of Toeplitz linear equations.","doi":"10.1109/79.526897","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/79.526897","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel4/79/11081/00526897.pdf","startPage":"29","endPage":"49","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI systolic arrays for adaptive nulling [radar]","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/526897/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1996","displayDocTitle":"VLSI systolic arrays for adaptive nulling [radar]","volume":"13","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1996","accessionNumber":"5345791","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI systolic arrays for adaptive nulling [radar]","sourcePdf":"00526897.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083023S","chronDate":"Jul 1996","isNumber":"11081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"63","articleId":"526897","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":526899,"authors":[{"name":"H.

A review of the area of array processing is given. The focus is on parameter estimation methods, and many relevant problems are only briefly mentioned. We emphasize the relatively more recent subspace-based methods in relation to beamforming. The article consists of background material and of the basic problem formulation. Then we introduce spectral-based algorithmic solutions to the signal parameter estimation problem. We contrast these suboptimal solutions to parametric methods. Techniques derived from maximum likelihood principles as well as geometric arguments are covered. Later, a number of more specialized research topics are briefly reviewed. Then, we look at a number of real-world problems for which sensor array processing methods have been applied. We also include an example with real experimental data involving closely spaced emitters and highly correlated signals, as well as a manufacturing application example.","doi":"10.1109/79.526899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/79.526899","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel4/79/11081/00526899.pdf","startPage":"67","endPage":"94","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two decades of array signal processing research: the parametric approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1996","displayDocTitle":"Two decades of array signal processing research: the parametric approach","volume":"13","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1996","accessionNumber":"5345793","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/526899/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two decades of array signal processing research: the parametric approach","sourcePdf":"00526899.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108954S","chronDate":"Jul 1996","isNumber":"11081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"2775","articleId":"526899","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":526912,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.

Yet complete decoupling of the aircraft as a nonlinear system is a formidable problem. Such a task requires accurate aircraft state information and rapid computing. The difficulties are compounded when the dynamics or the aerodynamics of the aircraft fall in the highly nonlinear regimes. The authors demonstrate the potential for an artificial neural network in conjunction with a linear compensator to perform such a function. The authors show that the linear compensator is unable to control the aircraft in the absence of the neural network. A neural network can be trained to produce the large nonlinear portion of the control inputs; however, a hybrid combination of the neural network and the compensator based on the linearized equations of motion gives the best results. Furthermore, The authors demonstrate that such a hybrid system can tolerate a large amount of noise in the network input. Several examples are shown, with and without the linear compensator. Finally, the authors demonstrate generalization within the training domain through accurately predicting a case that was absent in the training domain.","doi":"10.1109/37.526912","startPage":"22","endPage":"30","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/37.526912","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11106","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/5488303/11106/00526912.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear and neural network feedback for flight control decoupling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/526912/","displayDocTitle":"Linear and neural network feedback for flight control decoupling","volume":"16","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5348268","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear and neural network feedback for flight control decoupling","sourcePdf":"00526912.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043022S","chronDate":"Aug.  1996","isNumber":"11106","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"22","articleId":"526912","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":526915,"authors":[{"name":"Youbin Peng","affiliation":["Department of Control Engineering CP 165, Free University of Brussels, Brussels, Belgium"],"lastName":"Youbin Peng","id":"37354550600"},{"name":"D.

In this case, we propose the anti-windup method with a free parameter tuned to obtain a compromise between the incremental algorithm and the conditioning technique. We also introduce the new notion of conditioned transfer, and we it to be a more suitable solution than bumpless transfer.

The O(N) computational burden of the SFTF, compared with the O(N/sup 2/) burden of an RLS algorithm, allows the receiver to run in real-time, at reasonable cost, using commercially available digital signal processors.

Such embedded systems typically have soft or hard performance constraints. The increasing complexity of these systems makes them vulnerable to failures and their use in many safety-critical applications makes fault tolerance an important requirement. This peeper is the first to address the problem of automatic hardware-software co-synthesis of fault-tolerant embedded distributed real-time systems in a generalized scenario. We present an algorithm which tales as input the specification of the data-flow information in the form of a task graph, the performance constraints, the fault tolerance requirements and the available hardware resources in the form of processor, ASIC and link libraries. Our algorithm then synthesizes the required hardware as a distributed system in terms of the component processors, ASICs and interconnection links. The tasks are mapped to this hardware such that the overall system cost is minimized while still meeting the performance constraints and the fault tolerance requirements. Our algorithm uses clustering techniques to perform the synthesis. Fault tolerance is added using CRAFT, a technique we recently proposed for CRiticAlity based Fault Tolerance in real-time distributed systems.","doi":"10.1109/EURDAC.1995.527426","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of EURO-DAC.

Neural networks are useful at various levels in electronic eye applications, including low-level processing (feature extraction, active sensing, object detection) and high-level processing (object recognition, scene analysis, decision, control, and system integration). Neural networks are amenable to systems with a large number of processing cells enhanced by hierarchically structured interconnection. Their effective application-specific implementation hinges upon a thorough understanding of hierarchical network structure, training efficiency, real-time retrieving, and parallel processing technology. Particularly promising is a recently proposed decision-based Neural network (DBNN). We shall describe a face recognition system based on DBNN, developed jointly by Siemens Corporate Research and Princeton University. The system has yielded very high recognition accuracies based on experiments on public and in-house face databases. Issues on implementation and technology integration will be addressed. In terms of recognition accuracies, processing speeds, and parallel processing, the hierarchical DBNN perform far superior to that of the conventional multilayel perceptron (MLP).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/527473/","accessionNumber":"5225190","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-18 Sept. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks for electronic eyes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks for electronic eyes","confLoc":"Sakai, Japan","sourcePdf":"00527473.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049205S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4015","articleId":"527473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":527487,"authors":[{"name":"T.C.

We derive folding equations and use retiming for folding multirate systems to synthesize the control circuitry. A scheduling algorithm is presented which retimes the multirate filter bank to keep the memory requirements of the architecture low. Our approach can be used to design architectures for a wide variety of applications of full and pruned tree-structured filter banks including subband decompositions, discrete wavelet transforms, and computation of wavelet packet bases.","doi":"10.1109/VLSISP.1995.527487","publicationTitle":"VLSI Signal Processing, VIII","displayPublicationTitle":"VLSI Signal Processing, VIII","pdfPath":"/iel3/4015/11533/00527487.pdf","startPage":"157","endPage":"166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSISP.1995.527487","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11533","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=527487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systematic design of architectures for M-ary tree-structured filter banks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/527487/","displayDocTitle":"Systematic design of architectures for M-ary tree-structured filter banks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-18 Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5225203","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systematic design of architectures for M-ary tree-structured filter banks","confLoc":"Sakai, Japan","sourcePdf":"00527487.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030202S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4015","citationCount":"6","articleId":"527487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":527501,"authors":[{"name":"J.

With the multi-stage single chip mode, the lattice filtering and adaptation operations are done recursively each time a new input data arrives. With the multi-stage multi-chip mode, cascading multiple identical chips can extend the filter to a higher desired order. With the single-stage multi-chip mode, L chips can be connected as a pipeline to form a L-stage lattice filter with each chip serving as one lattice stage.

To solve the problems and improve the numerical performance, we propose an improved MAP (IMAP) algorithm, which is especially beneficial for high-Q ultra-high-speed digital filters. The IMAP algorithm is optimized in the aspect of the minimization of augmented pipelining order and undesirable quantization effects simultaneously. Performance of IMAP is compared with that of the conventional MAP algorithm, to demonstrate the advantage of the IMAP algorithm.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pipeline processing","Digital filters","Clustering algorithms","Prototypes","Scattering","Minimization methods","Parallel processing","Delay effects","Transfer functions","Very large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital filters","filtering theory","pipeline processing","quantisation (signal)","noise","recursive filters","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum-order augmented pipelining algorithm","clustered look-ahead filters","scattered look-ahead filters","MAP algorithm","optimized pipelining coefficients","numerical performance","high-Q ultra-high-speed digital filters","minimization","quantization effects"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VLSISP.1995.527520","publicationTitle":"VLSI Signal Processing, VIII","displayPublicationTitle":"VLSI Signal Processing, VIII","pdfPath":"/iel3/4015/11533/00527520.pdf","startPage":"491","endPage":"500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSISP.1995.527520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved minimum-order augmented pipelining algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=527520","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improved minimum-order augmented pipelining algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/527520/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5231517","conferenceDate":"16-18 Sept. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved minimum-order augmented pipelining algorithm","confLoc":"Sakai, Japan","sourcePdf":"00527520.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033728S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4015","citationCount":"2","articleId":"527520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":527526,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The new rotation sequences and schemes make CORDIC and CCM algorithms highly compatible in hardware implementation. Besides, cos/sup -1 /and sin/sup -1/ functions can also be realized with the new algorithm, which is hard for conventional algorithms. Moreover, this new rotation sequence can be applied to both trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. In implementation, the new algorithm results in smaller ROM size, smaller barrel shifters, simpler scaling factor compensation, and richer functional capabilities than conventional CORDIC processors.

In the worst case, the model takes mn(m+3) neurons and mn(n/sup 2/+n+5) interconnections to solve an n-job m-machine problem. However, the number of operations that can be handled is mn.

Several types of a neural network controller have been studied in order to incorporate these characteristics in servo controllers.

Most neural network controllers have to express the inverse dynamics of many-to-one plants. However the neural network output can only express one value. In this case the neural network appears to express only a part of the inverse dynamics. Therefore, one should investigate the characteristics of the neural network controller for a many-to-one plant.

In high voltage engineering, ANN have been applied efficiently and effectively for pattern recognition of partial discharges. A major field of ANN application is function estimation, because the useful properties of ANN such as adaptivity and non-linearity are well suited to function estimation tasks where the equation describing the function is unknown as the only prerequisite is a representative sample of the function's behavior. In this paper, the pre-requisite training data are available from experimental studies performed on models of polluted insulators under power frequency voltages representing different pollution levels ranging from light to severe pollutions. Extensive detailed studies and tests have been carried out to determine the ANN parameters to give the best available results and to assess the effect of the presence of inadequate data in the training set on modelling accuracy. The new approach using an ANN as a function estimator is employed to model accurately the relationship t=f(V, L, R/sub p/). It is found that, when training is complete, the ANN is capable of estimating the flashover time very efficiently and effectively even when the inadequate data are incorporated in the training set. The present study clearly indicates the efficacy of ANNs as function estimators in the insulator flashover studies.","doi":"10.1109/IACET.1995.527582","startPage":"320","endPage":"327","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE Conference on Industrial Automation and Control Emerging Technology Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IACET.1995.527582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11534","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE Conference on Industrial Automation and Control Emerging Technology Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4016/11534/00527582.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of polluted insulators flashover time using artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/527582/","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of polluted insulators flashover time using artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5099331","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"22-27 May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 May 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of polluted insulators flashover time using artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00527582.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046446S","chronDate":"22-27 May 1995","isNumber":"11534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4016","citationCount":"2","articleId":"527582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":527583,"authors":[{"name":"Jyh-Shan Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jyh-Shan Chang","id":"37087474751"},{"name":"Jenn-Huei Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jenn-Huei Lin","id":"37087679925"},{"name":"Tzi-Dar Chiueh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tzi-Dar Chiueh","id":"37087157344"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2645-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"527583","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Control systems","Multi-layer neural network","Artificial neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Recurrent neural networks","Computational modeling","Nonlinear control systems","Computer networks","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer perceptrons","feedforward neural nets","recurrent neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","generalisation (artificial intelligence)","road vehicles","neurocontrollers","digital simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["truck backer-upper control system","artificial neural networks","highly nonlinear control systems","radial-basis function network","recurrent neural networks","computer simulated truck","loading dock","planar parking lot","training samples","generalization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=527583","abstract":"Artificial neural networks have been studied for many years in the hope of achieving human-like performance in many fields.

Analysis of the B-ISDN network reveals that it is possible to incorporate a simplified fuzzy neural scheme into the call-connection model that can effect an efficient system. The network consists of interior nodes that interface to other nodes and exterior nodes that interface to the clients and network clients which are all interconnected by fibre optic links. Each node in the network contains an ATM packet switch now modified to include the fuzzy-neural scheme. This is expected to increase the efficiency of the switch architecture. This architecture now consists of the fuzzy-neural broadcast packet network (FNBPN). This FNBPN consists of a modified fuzzy-neural copy network (FNCN) interconnected in a maze to a fuzzy-neural routing network (FNRN). The arbitrary nature of the path of the point-to-point cells is controlled more systematically by the control processor (CP). This CP through a learning process configures the switch hardware to route incoming cells to the corresponding outgoing-cells and effecting efficient connections. The neural net learning function uses the backpropagation to learn the needed membership functions from a set of training examples if the output type is continuous and the learning method is supervised and the probabilistic method if the output type is discrete and the learning method is supervised; otherwise the popular Kohonen/LVQ is used as an unsupervised learning method. It can be concluded that the use of fuzzy-neural networks is beneficial in complex ATM processing.","doi":"10.1109/IACET.1995.527603","pdfPath":"/iel3/4016/11534/00527603.pdf","startPage":"459","endPage":"463","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE Conference on Industrial Automation and Control Emerging Technology Applications","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE Conference on Industrial Automation and Control Emerging Technology Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IACET.1995.527603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11534","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient call-connection model for multipoint connections in an ATM/B-ISDN network using fuzzy neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/527603/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Efficient call-connection model for multipoint connections in an ATM/B-ISDN network using fuzzy neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5099350","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"22-27 May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient call-connection model for multipoint connections in an ATM/B-ISDN network using fuzzy neural networks","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00527603.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046228S","chronDate":"22-27 May 1995","isNumber":"11534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4016","citationCount":"1","articleId":"527603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":527606,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The WFM filter is powerful for removing heavy additive impulse noises from images. By the filtering of each WFM filter, the filtered output signal is the mean value of the corrupted signals in a sample matrix, and these signals are weighted respectively by a membership grade of an associated fuzzy number stored in a knowledge base. The knowledge base contains a set of fuzzy numbers decided by experts or derived from the histogram of referred image. When the probability of occurrence of mixed impulse noises is over 0.3, the WFM filter can recover the noise-corrupted image quite well in contrast with the conventional filters, for examples, the median filters, nonlinear mean filters, RCRS, WOS, CWM, and stack filters, based on the mean absolute error (MAE) and mean square error (MSE) criteria. Besides, on the subjective evaluation of filtered images, the WFM filter results in a higher quality of global restoration.","doi":"10.1109/ISUMA.1995.527763","pdfPath":"/iel3/4012/11529/00527763.pdf","startPage":"601","endPage":"606","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd International Symposium on Uncertainty Modeling and Analysis and Annual Conference of the North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd International Symposium on Uncertainty Modeling and Analysis and Annual Conference of the North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISUMA.1995.527763","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weighted fuzzy mean filters for heavy-tailed noise removal","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/527763/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Weighted fuzzy mean filters for heavy-tailed noise removal","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5094000","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighted fuzzy mean filters for heavy-tailed noise removal","confLoc":"College Park, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00527763.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028075S","chronDate":"17-19 Sep 1995","isNumber":"11529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4012","citationCount":"8","articleId":"527763","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":527794,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In addition to this we show how one can use a genetic algorithm to optimize the controller and we present the concept of fuzzy situations for a sequential optimization. Thus we consider in one optimization phase the control behavior belonging to only one starting condition. We obtain a controller optimized for this situation. After optimizing two situations we combine the two controllers by a fusion algorithm, which is based on the different activation degrees in the last test runs. Our approach leads to a quite good control behavior, also when the control task is very complex. We show some results on the simulation of the well-known cart-pole-problem.","doi":"10.1109/ISUMA.1995.527794","startPage":"777","endPage":"781","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd International Symposium on Uncertainty Modeling and Analysis and Annual Conference of the North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISUMA.1995.527794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11529","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd International Symposium on Uncertainty Modeling and Analysis and Annual Conference of the North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society","pdfPath":"/iel3/4012/11529/00527794.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithms and fuzzy situations for sequential optimization of control surfaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/527794/","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithms and fuzzy situations for sequential optimization of control surfaces","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5094031","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sep 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithms and fuzzy situations for sequential optimization of control surfaces","confLoc":"College Park, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00527794.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027297S","chronDate":"17-19 Sep 1995","isNumber":"11529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4012","articleId":"527794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":527812,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The objective is to permit safe and inexpensive testing of low power circuits and bare dies that would otherwise require expensive heat removal equipment for testing at high speeds. Three new functions, namely transition controllability, observability and test generation costs, have been defined. It has been shown that the transition test generation cost is the minimum number of transitions required to test the corresponding stuck-at fault in fanout free circuits. This cost function is used for target fault selection while the other two functions are used to guide the backtrace and objective selection procedures of PODEM. The tests generated by the proposed ATPG decrease heat dissipation during test application by a factor of 2-23 for benchmark circuits.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., International Test Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/4035/11581/00527956.pdf","startPage":"250","endPage":"258","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., International Test Conference","doi":"10.1109/TEST.1994.527956","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.1994.527956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11581","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=527956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ATPG for heat dissipation minimization during test application","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic test pattern generation","Circuit testing","Automatic testing","Circuit faults","Test pattern generators","Design for testability","Power dissipation","CMOS technology","Cost function","Circuit synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooling","minimisation","integrated circuit testing","CMOS integrated circuits","economics","integrated circuit manufacture","heat sinks","cost optimal control","electronic engineering computing","logic testing","controllability","observability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ATPG","heat dissipation minimization","test application","low power circuits","bare dies","transition controllability","observability","test generation costs","transition test generation cost","stuck-at fault","fanout free circuits","target fault selection","backtrace","heat dissipation","benchmark circuits"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/527956/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Oct1994","displayDocTitle":"ATPG for heat dissipation minimization during test application","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4846978","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-6 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ATPG for heat dissipation minimization during test application","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00527956.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048874S","chronDate":"2-6 Oct1994","isNumber":"11581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035","citationCount":"33","articleId":"527956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":527963,"authors":[{"name":"J.

These are linear feedback shift registers over a Galois field GF(2/sup /spl delta//), (/spl delta/>1). Unlike conventional LFSRs, which are over GF(2), these generators are not equivalent to cellular arrays, and are shown do achieve significantly higher fault coverage. Experimental results are presented in this paper depicting that the proposed GLFSR can attain fault coverage equivalent to the LFSR, but with significantly fewer patterns. Specifically, results obtained demonstrate that in combinational circuits, for both stuck-at as well as transition faults, the proposed GLFSR outperforms all conventional pattern generators. Moreover, these experimental results are validated by certain randomness tests which demonstrate that the patterns generated by GLFSR achieve a higher degree of randomness.","doi":"10.1109/TEST.1994.527990","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., International Test Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., International Test Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/4035/11581/00527990.pdf","startPage":"481","endPage":"490","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.1994.527990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GLFSR-a new test pattern generator for built-in-self-test","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","conferenceDate":"2-6 Oct. 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/527990/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Oct1994","displayDocTitle":"GLFSR-a new test pattern generator for built-in-self-test","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4847013","publicationDate":"1994","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GLFSR-a new test pattern generator for built-in-self-test","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00527990.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054132S","chronDate":"2-6 Oct1994","isNumber":"11581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035","citationCount":"22","articleId":"527990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":527994,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

These techniques, along with on-chip test logic, which allows the DRAM core to be tested using conventional low-speed memory test equipment, enable full characterization of high bandwidth memories.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/527994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Oct1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4847017","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-6 Oct. 1994","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"Techniques for characterizing DRAMs with a 500 MHz interface","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Techniques for characterizing DRAMs with a 500 MHz interface","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00527994.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07093S","chronDate":"2-6 Oct1994","isNumber":"11581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035","citationCount":"3","articleId":"527994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":527995,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-Chul Oh","affiliation":["Memory Business Division, Samsung Electrical Company Limited, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sang-Chul Oh","id":"37350131000"},{"name":"Jae-Ho Kim","affiliation":["Memory Business Division, Samsung Electrical Company Limited, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jae-Ho Kim","id":"37351550200"},{"name":"Ho-Jeong Choi","affiliation":["Memory Business Division, Samsung Electrical Company Limited, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ho-Jeong Choi","id":"37348945400"},{"name":"Si-Don Choi","affiliation":["Memory Business Division, Samsung Electrical Company Limited, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Si-Don Choi","id":"37350658100"},{"name":"Ki-Tae Park","affiliation":["Memory Business Division, Samsung Electrical Company Limited, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ki-Tae Park","id":"37067231800"},{"name":"Jong-Woo Park","affiliation":["Memory Business Division, Samsung Electrical Company Limited, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong-Woo Park","id":"37281004200"},{"name":"Wha-Joon Lee","affiliation":["Memory Business Division, Samsung Electrical Company Limited, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Wha-Joon Lee","id":"37065769800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2103-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-3539"}],"articleNumber":"527995","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Failure analysis","Random access memory","System testing","Dielectric substrates","Material storage","Automatic testing","Subthreshold current","Feedback","Manufacturing processes","Dielectric materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["failure analysis","DRAM chips","fault diagnosis","automatic testing","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic failure analysis","high density DRAM","random bit failure","yield drop","electrical analysis","feedback","test vector generation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the automatic failure analysis method based on the random bit failure causing the major yield drop in DRAM and the analysis system named \"SEC FAILURE ANALYSIS SYSTEM\" are discussed.

We study the testability of analog circuits in the frequency domain by introducing the analog fault observability concept. This testability evaluation will be helpful in generating the test vectors and for selecting test nodes for the various types of faults. In the proposed approach test vector generation and test point selection allow a significant reduction in the number of measured output parameters necessary for testing (to one or two parameters) without a loss in fault coverage. The T-BIST approach consists of verifying whether or not the tested parameters for the given test vector are within the acceptance range. This technique is based on the conversion of each detected parameter to a DC voltage. Results are presented for different practical filters for which a complete test solution was achieved.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit testing","Circuit faults","Filters","Automatic testing","Voltage","Analog circuits","Frequency domain analysis","Observability","Robustness","Built-in self-test"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue circuits","built-in self test","observability","fault diagnosis","automatic testing","frequency-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog circuit testing","multifrequency test vector generation","testability analysis","output response detection","translation built-in self test","testability","frequency domain","analog fault observability","test point selection","fault coverage","T-BIST","DC voltage","filters","response analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TEST.1994.528008","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., International Test Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., International Test Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/4035/11581/00528008.pdf","startPage":"631","endPage":"640","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11581","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.1994.528008","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An integrated approach for analog circuit testing with a minimum number of detected parameters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=528008","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An integrated approach for analog circuit testing with a minimum number of detected parameters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/528008/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4847031","conferenceDate":"2-6 Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Oct1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An integrated approach for analog circuit testing with a minimum number of detected parameters","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00528008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028316S","chronDate":"2-6 Oct1994","isNumber":"11581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035","citationCount":"54","articleId":"528008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":528013,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Product quality requires the move of test activity downwards, down to IC physical level. High quality test requires the ability to cover physical defects. However, circuit complexity makes test preparation, at transistor level, prohibitive. A methodology for back annotation of physical defects into gate level realistic faults, is proposed in this paper. Bridging faults are selected, as they are the most likely faults in present-day process lines. It is shown that realistic faults, associated with routing patterns, can be used to represent the overall fault set, leading to an accurate evaluation of the defect level, used as the test quality indicator. A method to generate gate-level, realistic fault lists from the IC layout is presented, and is validated by simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/TEST.1994.528018","startPage":"720","endPage":"728","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., International Test Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/4035/11581/00528018.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., International Test Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.1994.528018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Back annotation of physical defects into gate-level, realistic faults in digital ICs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Circuit testing","Integrated circuit layout","Logic testing","Integrated circuit testing","Fault detection","Data mining","Semiconductor device modeling","CMOS technology","Very large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated logic circuits","VLSI","integrated circuit modelling","integrated circuit layout","fault diagnosis","logic testing","production testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physical defects","bridging faults","digital IC","IC complexity","product quality","high quality test","circuit complexity","back annotation","gate level realistic faults","routing patterns","defect level","test quality indicator","IC layout","simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/528018/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Oct1994","displayDocTitle":"Back annotation of physical defects into gate-level, realistic faults in digital ICs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-6 Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4847041","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Back annotation of physical defects into gate-level, realistic faults in digital ICs","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00528018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052975S","chronDate":"2-6 Oct1994","isNumber":"11581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035","citationCount":"10","articleId":"528018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":528065,"authors":[{"name":"D.E.

In optical CDMA, many nodes transmit simultaneously in the same frequency band. Accordingly, signals must be designed to reduce interference. In order to reduce interference among signals to acceptable levels, their bandwidth would be several orders of magnitude greater than the information bandwidth 1/T of the digital modulation; T being a bit duration. In order to do this, each bit is sub-divided into a number of binary \"chips\". The chip sequence constitutes a code that permits a bit stream broadcast on a network to be selected by means of a correlation process at the receiver destination. A large number of chip codes can be assigned to different users. The set of optical sequences essentially becomes a set of address codes or signature sequences for the network. The advantage of CDMA is that it is a true tell-and-go protocol. When one node wants to send traffic to another node, prior coordination is required only with that node. Multiple users can simultaneously access the channel with no waiting time, in contrast to other asynchronous protocols like CSMA or CSMA/CD where each user must wait for the channel to become idle before gaining access.

Vector quantization (VQ) is a powerful technique for very low bit rate image/video compression and is an attractive technique for mobile multimedia applications. Adaptive VQ techniques provide an excellent coding performance at the expense of significant increases in computational complexity making real-time implementation difficult. We propose a VLSI chip-set design to implement a high performance cache based (adaptive) VQ (CVQ) technique using VHDL for real-time video compression.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1995 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/4014/11531/00528091.pdf","startPage":"128","endPage":"131 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1995 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1995.528091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.1995.528091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11531","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=528091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time VLSI architecture for video compression","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Video compression","Image coding","Computational complexity","Computer architecture","Software algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Vector quantization","Bit rate","Videoconference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","video coding","vector quantisation","adaptive signal processing","digital signal processing chips","VLSI","real-time systems","hardware description languages","multimedia communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time VLSI architecture","vector quantization","very low bit rate compression","mobile multimedia applications","adaptive VQ","coding performance","computational complexity","VLSI chip-set design","cache based adaptive VQ","VHDL","real time video compression"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/528091/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Real-time VLSI architecture for video compression","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5199262","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time VLSI architecture for video compression","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00528091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03567S","chronDate":"5-8 Sep 1995","isNumber":"11531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4014","articleId":"528091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":528094,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"lastName":"Jun Huang","id":"37351593900"},{"name":"Tho Le-Ngoc","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"lastName":"Tho Le-Ngoc","id":"37271236200"},{"name":"J.E.

To achieve this goal, on-board packet switching is expected to be more efficient than its circuit-switched counterpart in supporting cell based ATM traffic. For congestion control, a TLB (tunable leaky bucket) scheme is implemented at the ground station to adjust the traffic flow according the predicted congestion status of downlink queue. Congestion in downlink queues is declared when the queue length exceeds a certain threshold. The performance of this broadband satellite communication system is evaluated using a matrix analytic queueing model. Heterogeneous traffic sources are assumed as MMPPs (Markov modulated Poisson process). Numerical results on congestion probability are given.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1995.528094","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1995 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1995 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/4014/11531/00528094.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.1995.528094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11531","startPage":"141","endPage":"144 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of a broadband satellite communications system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=528094","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of a broadband satellite communications system","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sep 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/528094/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5199265","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of a broadband satellite communications system","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00528094.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043177S","chronDate":"5-8 Sep 1995","isNumber":"11531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4014","citationCount":"2","articleId":"528094","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":528107,"authors":[{"name":"N.

We present a pattern discovery self organizing feature map (SOFM), followed by a recurrent dynamic neural network (RDNN) algorithm for signal representation and processing.

Due to nonexhaustive exploration of the trellis, the M-path algorithm is a suboptimal decoding algorithm. On the other hand, this elimination of certain paths from the trellis reduces its complexity in comparison with the Viterbi algorithm. The proposed modification adds to the traditional calculation of the branch metric an algebraic metric representing an estimate of the number of future symbol errors. By this new metric the performance of the M-path decoder is improved by about 0.5 dB.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1995.528115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.1995.528115","startPage":"225","endPage":"228 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1995 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/4014/11531/00528115.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1995 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"M-path decoder with algebraic metric calculation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"M-path decoder with algebraic metric calculation","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 1995","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5199286","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/528115/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"M-path decoder with algebraic metric calculation","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00528115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096795S","chronDate":"5-8 Sep 1995","isNumber":"11531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4014","articleId":"528115","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":528122,"authors":[{"name":"G.I.

Driver fatigue is perceived to be a major cause of these accidents. However, the presence of fatigue as documented in truck accident police reports does not support the commonly held perception that it is a problem. Either fatigue is not as much of a problem as perceived, or more likely, police accident reports significantly underestimate the involvement of driver fatigue in truck accidents. A neural network (NN) model provides a comprehensive method for identifying presence of fatigue in truck accidents from supplementary information in police report. A NN model is proposed to classify truck accident into fatigue and nonfatigue related. The model was able to learn the required function efficiently and a very high performance was observed.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1995.528150","startPage":"362","endPage":"365 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1995 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/4014/11531/00528150.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1995 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.1995.528150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network model for truck driver fatigue accident detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Fatigue","Road accidents","Road transportation","Biological neural networks","Statistical analysis","Civil engineering","Injuries","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","human factors","accidents","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["truck driver fatigue accident detection","neural network model","police accident reports"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/528150/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Neural network model for truck driver fatigue accident detection","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5199321","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network model for truck driver fatigue accident detection","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00528150.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076128S","chronDate":"5-8 Sep 1995","isNumber":"11531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4014","citationCount":"2","articleId":"528150","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":528155,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We consider the performance with different chip pulses and compare deterministic spreading sequences with random spreading sequences.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1995.528160","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1995 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1995 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/4014/11531/00528160.pdf","startPage":"404","endPage":"407 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.1995.528160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DS-CDMA commutation signalling with frequency offsets for wireless communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=528160","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sep 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/528160/","displayDocTitle":"DS-CDMA commutation signalling with frequency offsets for wireless communications","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5204981","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DS-CDMA commutation signalling with frequency offsets for wireless communications","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00528160.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066445S","chronDate":"5-8 Sep 1995","isNumber":"11531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4014","citationCount":"1","articleId":"528160","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":528168,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

In the second stage, an estimate of the corresponding uniform samples is obtained. The third stage consists in the successive application of an iterative procedure that improves the preliminary estimate of the uniform samples, by correcting the values of the nonuniform samples calculated from the estimate of the uniform samples. To obtain the estimate, two different methods are used: one based on the solution of systems of linear equations, and another one based on singular value decomposition.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing","Differential equations","Iterative methods","Sampling methods","Error correction","Finite wordlength effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","signal sampling","singular value decomposition","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-line method","signal recovery","nonuniform samples","block-rearrangement","sample ensemble","iterative procedure","linear equations","singular value decomposition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1995.528172","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1995 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1995 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/4014/11531/00528172.pdf","startPage":"457","endPage":"460 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11531","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.1995.528172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An on-line method for signal recovery from nonuniform samples using block-rearrangement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=528172","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An on-line method for signal recovery from nonuniform samples using block-rearrangement","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/528172/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5204993","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sep 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An on-line method for signal recovery from nonuniform samples using block-rearrangement","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00528172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030824S","chronDate":"5-8 Sep 1995","isNumber":"11531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4014","articleId":"528172","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":528187,"authors":[{"name":"H.R.

Except for the last class of users, mobile communications by radio is the only viable means for delivering this information. By far the largest volume of data that needs to be transferred from the infrastructure to mobile users concerns the state of congestion on highways. Since this can be done in a one-way broadcast mode, significant savings in communications cost and radio-frequency (RF) spectrum acquisition time can be achieved if an existing, widely available medium is used. For ITS purposes analog subcarriers have neither the capacity nor the robustness in a mobile environment to perform traffic data distribution. What is needed is a true digital subcarrier system that has enough capacity to reliably distribute traffic data with low latency in a mobile environment. This paper describes the design, development and testing of a new high-speed digital subcarrier system (HSDSS) called the Subcarrier Traffic Information Channel (STIC). STIC provides a digital data capability that performs extremely well in a multipath fading environment and yields a user data rate of about 8 kilobits per second (kb/s).

This clutter can be due to shadows, puddles, oil stains, tire skid marks, etc. This poses a challenge for edge-based lane detection schemes, as it is often impossible to select a gradient magnitude threshold which doesn't either remove edges of interest corresponding to road markings and edges or include edges corresponding to irrelevant clutter. The approach taken in this work is to use a deformable template model of lane structure to locate lane boundaries without thresholding the intensity gradient information. The Metropolis algorithm is used to maximize a function which evaluates how well the image gradient data supports a given set of template deformation parameters. The result, the LOIS lane detection algorithm (likelihood of image shape), is able to detect lane markings in situations with strong mottled shadows and broken or interrupted lane markings which would pose problems for algorithms which use local, thresholded edge information.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A deformable-template approach to lane detection","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Intelligent Vehicles '95.

The control knowledge is expressed in terms of membership functions for control parameters and a given rule set which defines the relationship among various parameters. Although this technique is robust, it cannot learn and adapt as parameters change over time. Neural network control uses learning for defining mapping between input and output data. By using fuzzy logic rule/membership knowledge and neural network learning capability, this work proposes a new method for combining the two intelligent control methods. The proposed neuro-fuzzy method embeds fuzzy rule and membership knowledge into a neural network for training via a backpropagation algorithm. Results based on fuzzy control, the Iwata-Machida-Toda method, and this proposed method are given for cart-pole problems. The proposed method has the best response time and the smallest magnitude of oscillations near the setpoint.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 Sep 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/528260/","accessionNumber":"5107078","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-26 Sept. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Embedding fuzzy knowledge into neural networks for control applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embedding fuzzy knowledge into neural networks for control applications","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00528260.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045055S","chronDate":"25-26 Sep 1995","isNumber":"11537","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4019","citationCount":"1","articleId":"528260","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":528285,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Since generic model-based recognition schemes are unsuitable for the analysis of traffic scenes and result in very poor performances, each of the different classes of objects which we expect to find in a typical scene is identified according to some selected features. After identifying the object, its main parameters are computed and, when needed, the object is further classified. The classes of objects we have considered included the roadbed, vehicles, buildings, trees, crosswalks and road signs. The method described here has been successfully tested on a wide set of images of traffic scenes and provided a general-purpose reconstruction of the whole traffic scene as viewed by the driver.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.1995.528285","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Intelligent Vehicles '95.

In this contribution we use that information to detect obstacles in front of a moving vehicle. Since the detection is based on motion no a-priori knowledge about obstacle shape is required. Optical flow vectors are estimated from spatio-temporal derivatives of the gray value function which are computed at video frame rate by the custom-designed hardware MiniVISTA. To eliminate outliers and to speed up obstacle detection by data reduction the estimated vectors are clustered before they are passed to the obstacle test. The purpose of the obstacle test is to separate moving objects from the stationary environment and to separate elevated objects from the ground plane. In continuation of our previous work, obstacle detection is regarded as a state estimation problem. This enables us to enlarge the motion stereo basis by applying a Kalman filter to track optical flow vectors over subsequent image frames. Experimental results obtained from image sequences recorded with our experimental vehicle are presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time estimation and tracking of optical flow vectors for obstacle detection","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Intelligent Vehicles '95.

Traffic signs are identified by the interpretation of their ideograms realized by different modules in our TSR. The first module detects the position and direction of arrows. A second tool recognizes numerals and interprets them as reasonable speed limits. A third one is a general nearest neighbor classifier applied to three classes of ideograms (prohibition sign ideograms, speed limits, arrows on mandatory signs). The fourth module is based on neural nets and applied to two of these classes. Some of these components are used competitively in our realtime TSR.

Almost all of the work that has been done in the area of evaluating the performance of these systems has focused on the accuracy of the recovered lane geometry. Reliability of feature detection as a function of intrinsic marking properties, ambient lighting and weather conditions, and viewing geometry is an equally important aspect of algorithm performance which must be explored if progress is to continue in this area of research. This paper reports a small scale effort to attack one aspect of this problem, the automated characterization of the intrinsic visual properties of white painted lane markings. Images of the right lane marking are taken by a camera mounted in an trailer enclosure towed behind a vehicle, allowing control of the lighting conditions. The intensity histogram of each image is examined to select a threshold which is used to classify each pixel as pavement or stripe. The edges of the white stripe are located using robust estimation and a shared vanishing point constraint. Once the stripe edges are located in an image, stripe properties such as width, brightness, and contrast with the pavement are calculated.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11537","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.1995.528330","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Intelligent Vehicles '95.

These accidents are often caused by driver inattention, or driver impairment (e.g. fatigued or intoxicated drivers). A system capable of warning the driver when the vehicle starts to depart the roadway, or controlling the lateral position of the vehicle to keep it in its lane, could potentially eliminate many of these crashes. This paper presents a system called RALPH (Rapidly Adapting Lateral Position Handler) which decomposes the problem of steering a vehicle into three steps, 1) sampling of the image, 2) determining the road curvature, and 3) determining the lateral offset of the vehicle relative to the lane center. The output of the later two steps are combined into a steering command, which can be compared with the human driver's current steering direction as part of a road departure warning system, or sent directly to the steering motor.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.1995.528333","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Intelligent Vehicles '95.

The data base includes 12000 impulse response estimates which were obtained by inverse Fourier transforming of the channel's frequency response profiles. Extensive curve fitting for the distribution of individual multipath components' amplitudes using elaborate tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Wilcoxon procedures shows that amplitude fading is lognormal for both local and global data. For the local data, the lognormal, Nakagami, and Rayleigh distributions passed the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with a 90% confidence level for 76%, 36%, and 13% of cases, respectively. For global data the Wilcoxon test showed that with 99% confidence lognormal is better than Nakagami, and with 94% confidence Nakagami fits the data better than Rayleigh. After establishing the lognormality of signal amplitude fading in these environments, a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution for simulating the log- amplitudes of spatially-adjacent profiles has been proposed and implemented.","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1993.528353","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2nd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2nd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/4060/11625/00528353.pdf","startPage":"84","endPage":"88 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1993.528353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical modeling of signal amplitude fading of indoor radio propagation channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=528353","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/528353/","displayDocTitle":"Statistical modeling of signal amplitude fading of indoor radio propagation channels","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4979365","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical modeling of signal amplitude fading of indoor radio propagation channels","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00528353.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033381S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct 1993","isNumber":"11625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4060","citationCount":"28","articleId":"528353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":528384,"authors":[{"name":"T.

For microcellular systems, synchronization errors between mutual users are relatively small when every reverse-link signal is synchronized with synchronized forward-link signals at the receiver. Orthogonal sequence spreading in the reverse-link reduces the interference generated by users in the same cell without additional processing. The system has a large capacity when the radius is such that interference from users in surrounding cells is comparable to that from users in the same cell.","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1993.528385","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2nd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2nd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/4060/11625/00528385.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1993.528385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11625","startPage":"244","endPage":"248 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reverse-link performance for microcell DS-CDMA system with orthogonal sequence spreading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=528385","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reverse-link performance for microcell DS-CDMA system with orthogonal sequence spreading","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/528385/","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 1993","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4979397","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reverse-link performance for microcell DS-CDMA system with orthogonal sequence spreading","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00528385.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040858S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct 1993","isNumber":"11625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4060","articleId":"528385","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":528396,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Furthermore, the high cost, size, and weight of these systems make them unsuitable for helicopter applications. In this paper, various diversity techniques have been investigated for optimum design. Coding, modulation, and interleaving are all employed to mitigate periodic RF signal blockage, due to the main rotor blades, and high Doppler frequency shifts. At the same time, the helicopter's wide angle rapid flight maneuvers impose restrictions on the antenna requirements for continuous coverage.

The Code Division Testbed (CODIT) project is a research project within the European RACE programme that has the objective to explore the potential of CDMA for a future third generation mobile system like FPLMTS or UMTS. The main activities of the project are: To establish an advanced system concept based on CDMA including advanced radio technologies (radio interface, radio transceivers, etc.) and advanced radio subsystem architecture (micro and picocells, macro diversity, fast and soft handover, frequency management, radio network planning, etc.). To design and build a system demonstrator (testbed) comprising test mobile stations, radio base stations and a radio network controller. To validate the system concept in laboratory and field test, as well as with simulations. The results will be used to improve the concept and to compare with other radio access techniques. The project duration was from February 1992 to December 1994. During 1992 the basis for the system concept was established.

The experiments were designed to test the radio link of a low-power TDMA based system suitable for access to telephone networks. The experimental technology used was proposed and implemented by Bellcore. The tests were conducted in a light business area with heavy tree foliage along the streets in Boulder, CO. Quality metrics used were: Subjective Voice Quality, Word Error Rates (WER), and Received Signal Strength (RSS); for these experiments the radio coverage was power limited, not delay spread limited. Thus, adaptive equalizers were unnecessary. Excellent coverage was obtained within +/- three blocks line of sight from the base (outdoor) and +/- one block from the base in a mixed (indoor-to-outdoors) environment. This work is targeted towards understanding the implications to local exchange network of wireless technology alternatives that could provide access to those networks.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1993.528427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11625","startPage":"458","endPage":"465 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2nd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/4060/11625/00528427.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measured performance of QPSK in a PCS environment for a TDMA portable radio link","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/528427/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"Measured performance of QPSK in a PCS environment for a TDMA portable radio link","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 1993","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4979437","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measured performance of QPSK in a PCS environment for a TDMA portable radio link","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00528427.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037845S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct 1993","isNumber":"11625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4060","articleId":"528427","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":528435,"authors":[{"name":"K.G.

The soft-outputs are not only suitable for improving the performance of a next stage (in this study an outer soft-decision Viterbi decoder), but also for reducing the complexity of the multiuser detector itself. In this way, a family of suboptimum multiuser detectors with adjustable performance/complexity tradeoff is obtained in a structured manner from the optimum multiuser detector. Reliability generation is applied by post-processing hard decisions of an auxiliary (single or multiuser) detector delivering tentative decisions given matched filter outputs. Reduced-complexity multiuser detection is based on exhaustively searching only in a subset of unreliable decisions given the reliability estimates. A decision-feedback mechanism is shown to be included. In particular it is indicated that the decision-feedback multiuser detector is outperformed on a Gaussian channel, and that almost all multiuser interference is cancelled out in a coded multiuser system in Rayleigh fading, i.e., in a severe near-far situation. The latter result corresponds to a gain on the order of 4 dB at a bit error rate of 10 compared to conventional detection, or a loss of only about 1 dB compared to single user system.","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1993.528460","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2nd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2nd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/4060/11626/00528460.pdf","startPage":"641","endPage":"646 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1993.528460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11626","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On channel coding and multiuser detection for DS-CDMA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/528460/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"On channel coding and multiuser detection for DS-CDMA","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4979468","volume":"2","publicationDate":"1993","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On channel coding and multiuser detection for DS-CDMA","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00528460.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066656S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct 1993","isNumber":"11626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4060","citationCount":"21","articleId":"528460","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":528461,"authors":[{"name":"S.H.

Several mobility models have been proposed in the previous studies, each of them depicts the terminal mobility by a simple method. In this paper, the authors studied Thomas's, Hong's and Guerin's mobility models. They find that Thomas's formula for outgoing terminals can be extended to the other two models. Thus, some system performance information derived from Thomas' model can also be used in the other two models. In the next analysis of a mobility model, the probability density function (PDF) of terminal speeds is a very important condition. For a given PDF for total terminals, a subset of terminals, such as the boundary-crossing terminals of the speed-renewing terminals (if the model requires speed-renewing), may have a different PDF, which follows the \"Biased Sampling\" formula. The PDF of moving directions at boundaries is also biased. The proposed formulas, boundary conditions and renewal conditions can be used as the basic components for the future studies of cellular systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2nd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/4060/11626/00528490.pdf","startPage":"803","endPage":"807 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2nd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1993.528490","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1993.528490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11626","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=528490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobility models and biased sampling problem","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Performance analysis","Land mobile radio cellular systems","System performance","Probability density function","Random variables","Laboratories","Information analysis","Boundary conditions","Cellular networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","telecommunication terminals","boundary-value problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biased sampling","cellular networks","mobility models","mobile terminals","probability density function","boundary-crossing terminals","boundary conditions","renewal conditions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/528490/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"Mobility models and biased sampling problem","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4979497","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobility models and biased sampling problem","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00528490.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028855S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct 1993","isNumber":"11626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4060","citationCount":"56","articleId":"528490","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":528493,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Another interesting technique is a CDMA system with Rake-receiver. The main advantages of CDMA are well known, but its capacity is limited by multiuser interference. The aim of this study is to combine the principle of a CDMA system with OFDM. This combination allows one to perform a maximum-likelihood detection (MLD), to use the spectrum in an efficient way, to exploit frequency diversity, and to retain many advantages of a CDMA system. In addition, it permits simple cell-separation by using frequency hopping, and a simple hardware realization. Two examples for mobile communication system using CDMA/OFDM with Walsh-Hadamard code-spreading for the downlink (Base-Mobile) are studied. Different coherent detection algorithms such as conventional detection, MLD, and iterative detection are analyzed. The analytical performance of MLD is evaluated. It is shown that by using BPSK modulation, one can transmit 64 active users at rate of about 16.664 kbit/sec in a 1.28 MHz bandwidth, resulting in a spectral efficiency of 0.8332 bit/sec/Hz. By using QPSK modulation half of this bandwidth will be used. It is also analytically shown that the performance of a CDMA/OFDM with MLD, using frequency-diversity is comparable to an optimum CDMA system with Rake-receiver using multipath diversity. However, in practice providing diversity with OFDM is much simpler than a Rake-receiver. In addition, the OFDM technique simplifies the channel-estimation problem.

Narrowband CDMA with system bandwidth of 1.25 MHz is considered. Coherent reception using a pilot signal, BPSK modulation with 1/2 convolution codes, and power control are considered. Capacity of the downlink is evaluated as a function of multipath diversity, path loss exponent, and power control strategies. Both slow and fast power control on the downlink are considered. With slow power control, the capacity is severely limited. It is observed that fast power control significantly improves the capacity of the downlink.

The architecture is suitable to an environment affected by a large degree of shadowing. In such an environment if the data rate is not excessively high then due to the relatively small excess delays the channel exhibits relatively flat fading. The CDMA antenna concept is a means to artificially increase the excess delay so as to create frequency selective fading over the bandwidth of the transmitted signal, hence, frequency diversity is effectively achieved through the use of a Rake receiver. The architecture is applicable in scenarios where a leaky-feeder cable has traditionally been employed.","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1993.528527","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2nd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2nd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/4060/11626/00528527.pdf","startPage":"990","endPage":"994 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1993.528527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11626","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CDMA distributed antenna system for indoor wireless communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/528527/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"CDMA distributed antenna system for indoor wireless communications","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4979534","volume":"2","publicationDate":"1993","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CDMA distributed antenna system for indoor wireless communications","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00528527.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038202S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct 1993","isNumber":"11626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4060","citationCount":"22","articleId":"528527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":528528,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The authors search for sets of sequences that minimize the probability of bit detection error, given that there is imperfect synchronization among the signals. Orthogonal sequences based on the Sylvester-type Hadamard matrices (Walsh functions) are shown to provide a large improvement over the case where an orthogonal set is chosen at random. For these sequences closed form expressions are derived for the average bit error rate. Computer searches indicate that this set of codes has special properties with respect to minimizing the average cross-correlations between the different signals for small errors in chip synchronization. It appears that these codes are optimal. A multi-carrier signalling scheme designed to help synchronize the CDMA signals at the chip level is also discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2nd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/4060/11626/00528528.pdf","startPage":"995","endPage":"999 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2nd IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1993.528528","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1993.528528","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11626","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=528528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of orthogonal CDMA codes for quasi-synchronous communication systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Signal processing","Bit error rate","Transmitters","Correlators","Computer errors","Error correction","Error correction codes","Signal design","Spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["personal communication networks","code division multiple access","sequences","error statistics","synchronisation","correlation theory","telecommunication signalling","Walsh functions","Hadamard matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal CDMA codes","quasi-synchronous communication systems","direct-sequence CDMA","probability of bit detection error","Sylvester-type Hadamard matrices","Walsh functions","average cross-correlations","chip synchronization","multi-carrier signalling scheme"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/528528/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"Performance of orthogonal CDMA codes for quasi-synchronous communication systems","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4979535","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of orthogonal CDMA codes for quasi-synchronous communication systems","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00528528.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032511S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct 1993","isNumber":"11626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4060","citationCount":"98","articleId":"528528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":528529,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The problem considered is that of designing a controller for an autonomous underwater vehicle to provide directional control. A flux gate compass is used to measure the yaw angle and yaw rate. Directional control is performed by two thrusters in the horizontal plane. Weight adaptation of the neural network is achieved by minimizing an objective function that is weighted sum of tracking errors and control input rates.

The properties of underwater acoustic channels are thus very important in the design of high data rate acoustic telemetry systems. The authors review the essential properties of such channels. Based on some experimental results and analytical considerations they point out the limitations of the Rayleigh fading model commonly used in modeling underwater acoustic channels. This model has been adapted from microwave and radio communications in which received signals arrive along scattered paths. In an underwater acoustic channel there can be several distinct paths (eigenpaths) over which a signal can propagate from transmitter to receiver (eigenpath signals). Each eigenpath signal contains a dominant, stable component and many smaller, randomly scattered components (sub-eigenpath components). The envelope of the eigenpath signal can therefore be described using a Rice fading model. Based on the above the authors develop a novel channel model in which each eigenpath signal is described using a certain signal-to-multipath ratio, propagation time delay and Doppler shift. They propose a structure for a simulator of such a channel, to be used in conjunction with different transmission schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/528591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5225669","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 1995","displayDocTitle":"An eigenpath underwater acoustic communication channel model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An eigenpath underwater acoustic communication channel model","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00528591.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023763S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4054","citationCount":"35","articleId":"528591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":528592,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Hoon Yoon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"lastName":"Young-Hoon Yoon","id":"37351579300"},{"name":"A.

In its rudimentary form, a symbol interval of length T is partioned into N chips, modulated with cyclic shift of an underlying length N code sequence. The information is demodulated using an FFT matched filter, which realizes periodic correlation. The information rate of the basic system is (1/T)log/sub 2/N bits/second. We discuss the application of CSK-SS to acoustic telemetry, with an aim towards improving the spectral efficiency by overlaying multiple codes. The demodulator is a mismatched filter (equalizer) that trades off SNR for a reduction in the ISI self-noise caused by the overlay. In this way, increased spectral efficiency is possible at the expense of poorer performance in the presence of channel impairments such as phase offset and timing jitter.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1995.528666","startPage":"1386","publicationTitle":"'Challenges of Our Changing Global Environment'.

Several techniques have been devised for reducing the computational load of the equalizer by exploiting structure in the acoustic environment. In essence, these methods trade equalizer decoding performance for computational efficiency by reducing the number of equalizer parameters, the complexity of the update algorithm, or the rate of parameter updating. In this paper, a generalized equalizer model is developed combining several such complexity reduction techniques. From this viewpoint, the potential and limitations of each technique are discussed.

AUVs equipped with video hardware can provide invaluable visual data to ocean researchers for exploration of the undersea environment. In the past, a popular medium for the transport of underwater video from the vehicle to a remote platform has been a fiber optic link. Such tethered AUVs have a limited range of exploration, therefore an idea has previously been proposed to capture and process video on-board an untethered vehicle then transmit it using underwater telemetry. Video communication requires a considerably larger bandwidth than that which an underwater acoustic channel may provide therefore massive data compression must take place prior to transmission from the AUV. This work addresses the compression problem by presenting a wavelet-based hybrid video encoder for low bit-rate encoding of underwater video. Results show that compression rates on the order of 100:1 may be achieved with good visual quality in the reconstructed video.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1995.528670","publicationTitle":"'Challenges of Our Changing Global Environment'.

To overcome this problem we exploit the natural sparseness of the reverberation pattern. By focusing only on those intervals which contain a significant portion of the signal energy, the sparse equalization method provides data detection using a minimum complexity adaptive receiver subject to an upper bound on the signal estimation error. Experimental results demonstrate an order of magnitude reduction in computational complexity with a negligible loss in performance.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1995.528671","startPage":"1417","publicationTitle":"'Challenges of Our Changing Global Environment'.

We have developed a technique for displaying and navigating large information spaces. The key concept is the use of an information mural, a two-dimensional reduced representation of an entire information space that fits completely within a display window or screen. Information murals use grayscale shading and color along with anti-aliasing techniques to create a miniature version of the entire data set. By incorporating navigational capabilities, information murals become a tool that can be used as a global view along with more detailed informational displays. Information murals are utilized in our software visualization research to help depict the execution of object-oriented programs, and can also be used in more general information visualization applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/528685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30-31 Oct. 1995","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"30-31 Oct. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","accessionNumber":"5125603","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The information mural: a technique for displaying and navigating large information spaces","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The information mural: a technique for displaying and navigating large information spaces","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00528685.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040864S","chronDate":"30-31 Oct. 1995","isNumber":"11604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4050","citationCount":"15","articleId":"528685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":528686,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

The spatial representation may then be visually browsed and analyzed in ways that avoid language processing and that reduce the analysts mental workload. The result is an interaction with text that more nearly resembles perception and action with the natural world than with the abstractions of written language.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Information analysis","Software libraries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","library automation","libraries","information retrieval","word processing","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial analysis","text content spatialization","nonvisual visualization","visual browsing","visual analysis","large text document corpora","digital libraries","regulations","procedures","archived reports","text content","spatial representation","informational characteristics","information interaction","text documents","perception","action","natural world"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=528686","doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.1995.528686","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Visualization 1995 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4050/11604/00528686.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00528686.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1995.528686","startPage":"51","endPage":"58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11604","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Visualization 1995 Conference","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visualizing the non-visual: spatial analysis and interaction with information from text documents","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Visualizing the non-visual: spatial analysis and interaction with information from text documents","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/528686/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30-31 Oct. 1995","conferenceDate":"30-31 Oct. 1995","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5125604","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visualizing the non-visual: spatial analysis and interaction with information from text documents","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00528686.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035397S","chronDate":"30-31 Oct. 1995","isNumber":"11604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4050","citationCount":"215","articleId":"528686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":528688,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Existing systems for visualizing huge hierarchies using cone trees \"break down\" once the hierarchy to be displayed exceeds roughly 1000 nodes, due to increasing visual clutter. The paper describes a system called fsviz which visualizes arbitrarily large hierarchies while retaining user control. This is accomplished by augmenting cone trees with several graphical and interaction techniques: usage-based filtering, animated zooming, hand-coupled rotation, fish-eye zooming, coalescing of distant nodes, texturing, effective use of colour for depth cueing, and the applications of dynamic queries. The fsviz system also improves upon earlier cone tree visualization systems through a more elaborate node layout algorithm. This algorithm enhances the usefulness of cone tree visualization for large hierarchies by all but eliminating clutter.","doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.1995.528689","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Visualization 1995 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Visualization 1995 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4050/11604/00528689.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"81","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1995.528689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11604","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research report.

The need is driven by the growing number of domains where there is a requirement for users to understand, navigate and manipulate large sets of computer based data; by the increasing size and complexity of this information and by the pressures to use this information efficiently. The paradigmatic example is the World Wide Web, but other domains include software systems, information systems and concurrent engineering. One approach to providing this support is to provide sophisticated visualisation tools which lead the users to form an intuitive understanding of the structure and behaviour of their domain and which provide mechanisms which allow them to manipulate objects within their system.

Search tools exist that allow users to find relevant information. However, a search can often produce such a large amount of data that it becomes hard to ferret out the most appropriate and highest quality information. In addition, some search tools lose valuable information when displaying the results to the user. The paper describes a search visualization tool, called FISH, for viewing hierarchically structured information and managing information overload. FISH (Forager for the Information Super Highway) allows users to visualize the results of search requests across large document spaces in a way that preserves the structure of the information space. FISH displays the returned documents as rectangles, using a combination of order, indentation, size, and color to denote document hierarchy, the score of the documents with respect to the search, and other data attributes. In addition, the user can navigate through the document space for in-depth probing and refinement.","doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.1995.528693","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Visualization 1995 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Visualization 1995 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4050/11604/00528693.pdf","startPage":"105","endPage":"111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1995.528693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11604","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Case study: fishing for information on the Internet","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/528693/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30-31 Oct. 1995","displayDocTitle":"Case study: fishing for information on the Internet","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5125611","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","conferenceDate":"30-31 Oct. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Case study: fishing for information on the Internet","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00528693.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.135829S","chronDate":"30-31 Oct. 1995","isNumber":"11604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4050","citationCount":"4","articleId":"528693","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":528788,"authors":[{"name":"M.R.

To demonstrate STARI, a chip has been fabricated using the MOSIS 2/spl mu/ CMOS process. In a simple test fixture, it operates at data rates of 120 Mbits/sec over a pair of wires. Because STARl uses both synchronous and self-timed circuits, it provides an opportunity to compare these two design methods. The synchronous circuits of the STARI chip achieve rates of operation two to three times those of the self-timed circuits. However, the self-timed FIFO in the receiver provides robust compensation for clock skew that could not be achieved with synchronous circuitry alone. Thus, the STARI chip demonstrates advantages of combining these two design techniques.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICCD '95 International Conference on Computer Design.

This paper describes a new, efficient analysis algorithm to derive tight bounds on the execution time required for an application task executing on a distributed system. Tight bounds are essential to cosynthesis algorithms. Our bounding algorithms are valid for a general problem model: the system can contain several tasks with different periods; each task is partitioned into a set of processes related by data dependencies; the periods and the computation times of processes are bounded but not necessarily constant. Experimental results show that our algorithm can find tight bounds in small amounts of CPU time.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1995.528792","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICCD '95 International Conference on Computer Design.

The basic premise is that the wires with high switching should be made short even if it involves stretching several low switching wires.

Attempts to include switching probabilities into channel routing did not produce appreciable results.

In order to analyze the routability of designed switch modules, a heuristic algorithm based on network-flow techniques was proposed. In this paper, we mathematically show that the network-flow based algorithm has provably good performance with the bounds 5 and 5/4 away from the optima for two types of switch modules, respectively. Based on the analyses, we developed a new method for designing switch modules. Experimental results show that our designed switch modules significantly improve routability, compared with those by K.

First, delay-optimal mapping is performed which simultaneously minimizes area and delay. Then, the mapped circuits are restructured to alleviate the potential routing congestions. Experimental results indicate that the first phase creates designs which require 17% fewer levels and 40% fewer LUTs than MIS-pga (delay), 11% fewer levels and 37% fewer LUTs than FlowMap-r, and 5% fewer levels and 39% fewer LUTs than TechMap-D. The success of the second phase is confirmed by running a vendor's layout tool APR. It is observed that they are more routable and have less final delays than those produced by other mappers if they are placed and routed.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1995.528841","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.1995.528841","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICCD '95 International Conference on Computer Design.

The methodology takes spatial and temporal correlations of logic signals into consideration. Given the state transition graph (STG) of a finite state machine (FSM), we create an extended state transition graph (ESTG), where the temporal correlations of the input signals are explicitly represented. From the graph we derive the equations to calculate exact signal probabilities and activities. For large circuits an approximate method for calculating the activities by unrolling the next state logic is proposed. Experimental results show that if temporal and spatial correlations are not considered, the switching activities of the internal nodes can be off by more than 40% compared to simulation based techniques. However, the results of the approximate method proposed in the paper is within 5% of logic simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1995.528926","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICCD '95 International Conference on Computer Design.

The basic principle of the proposed systolic array is that one-dimensional (1-D) DCT can be decomposed to a 2-dimensional (2-D) DCT by input and output index mappings and the 2-D DCT is computed efficiently on a 2-D systolic array. We modify Lee's input index mapping method in order to construct one input mapping table instead of three input index mapping tables. The proposed systolic array avoids the need for the array transposer that was required by earlier implementations for the prime-factor DCT algorithms, and thus all processing can be pipelined. The proposed design of systolic array provides a simple and regular structure, which is well suited for VLSI implementation.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICCD '95 International Conference on Computer Design.

Instead of estimating the absolute routing cost of a net, this function captures the relative routing costs of nets based on the number of terminals on the nets. Unlike the routing cost functions proposed earlier, the proposed cost function does not require layout-parameters or any tuning of the variables to achieve acceptable estimation of the routing cost. The usefulness of the proposed routing cost is verified by minimizing it during the process of logic extraction in logic synthesis, leading to an average of 10% improvement in the routing area and 8% improvement in the chip area at no performance loss.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1995.528938","startPage":"658","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICCD '95 International Conference on Computer Design.

Variable-precision arithmetic allows the precision of the computation to be specified, based on the problem to be solved and the required accuracy of the results. Interval arithmetic produces two values for each result, such that the true result is guaranteed to be between the two values. The coprocessor gives the programmer the ability to specify the precision of the computation, determine the accuracy of the results, and recompute inaccurate results with higher precision. Direct hardware support for variable-precision, interval arithmetic greatly improves the accuracy and reliability of numerical computations.

In order to meet the high-performance/low-cost constraints, the state-of-the-art video processor should be a programmable design which performs various tasks in video applications without sacrificing the computational power and the manufacturing cost in exchange for such flexibility. In this paper, we present a programmable video co-processor design that is capable of performing FIR/IIR filtering, subband filtering, and most discrete orthogonal transforms (DT), for the host processor in video applications. The computational speed of this co-processor is as fast as that of ASIC designs which are optimized for individual specific applications. We also show that the system can be easily reconfigured to perform multirate FIR/IIR/DT operations at negligible hardware overhead. Hence, we can either double the processing speed on the fly based on the same processing elements, or apply this feature to the low-power implementation of this co-processor.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1995.529039","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4052/11606/00529039.pdf","startPage":"61","endPage":"64 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1995.529039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel programmable video co-processor design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=529039","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Oct. 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/529039/","displayDocTitle":"Parallel programmable video co-processor design","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5237261","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel programmable video co-processor design","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00529039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039819S","chronDate":"23-26 Oct. 1995","isNumber":"11606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4052","articleId":"529039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":529049,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

The fixed-rate lattice VQ is an extension of the entropy-coded lattice vector quantizer (ECLVQ) [Mohdyusof and Fischer, 1994]. For an error-free channel, image coding using ECLVQ provides competitive performance with other methods. ECLVQ is a variable length coder, hence a single bit error in the encoded bit stream could lead to error propagation resulting in severe degradation in image quality. A fixed-rate lattice VQ is constructed from the ECLVQ by grouping together several vectors as a \"macroblock\". The macroblock is encoded at a fixed rate, while allowing a variety of encoding rates for each vector in the macroblock. In the event of a transmission error, error propagation is confined to that particular macroblock. In this work we assume the encoded bit stream is transmitted over a binary symmetric channel. The simulation results show that the FRLVQ subband image coding provides competitive performance with other fixed-rate image coding systems. The simulation results also indicate FRLVQ performance degrades gracefully in the presence of channel noise.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4052/11606/00529049.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"104 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1995.529049","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1995.529049","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11606","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=529049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subband image coding using a fixed-rate lattice vector quantizer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Lattices","Streaming media","Degradation","Image quality","Protection","Government","Entropy","Quantization","Laplace equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","vector quantisation","lattice theory","entropy codes","error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subband image coding","fixed-rate lattice vector quantizer","entropy-coded lattice vector quantizer","error-free channel","variable length coder","single bit error","error propagation","degradation","image quality","macroblock","encoding rates","transmission error","binary symmetric channel","performance","channel noise"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/529049/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"Subband image coding using a fixed-rate lattice vector quantizer","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5237271","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subband image coding using a fixed-rate lattice vector quantizer","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00529049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045203S","chronDate":"23-26 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4052","citationCount":"7","articleId":"529049","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":529056,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Conventional systems require low-speed users to either pay a cost premium (e.g., high-speed burst modems for TDMA) or end up wasting some of the spectrum (e.g., universal time slots). The advantages of our proposed scheme can be demonstrated with any two combinations (or all three) of time slicing, frequency slicing, and code slicing. For instance, with a time-frequency-slicing approach, users can be assigned different portions of the spectrum (e.g., on a slot-by-slot basis), allowing them access to only the needed fraction of the shared resource. With time-code slicing, users are dynamically granted portions of the code space, during specified time periods. Finally, in frequency-code slicing, a user may be assigned a number of codes in different frequency bands. These codes can be of constant or variable chip rates.","doi":"10.1109/WNCMF.1994.529110","publicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Wireless Networks - Catching the Mobile Future.","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Wireless Networks - Catching the Mobile Future.","pdfPath":"/iel2/4069/11647/00529110.pdf","startPage":"1009","endPage":"1013 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WNCMF.1994.529110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrally efficient universal time slots using time-frequency-code slicing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=529110","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/529110/","displayDocTitle":"Spectrally efficient universal time slots using time-frequency-code slicing","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5177271","conferenceDate":"18-23 Sept. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrally efficient universal time slots using time-frequency-code slicing","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00529110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041312S","chronDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","isNumber":"11647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4069","citationCount":"4","articleId":"529110","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":529113,"authors":[{"name":"H.R.R. van Roosmalen","affiliation":["Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"H.R.R.","lastName":"van Roosmalen","id":"37355354000"},{"name":"J.A.M.

Road tunnels are commonly served by leaky feeders to provide VHF radio coverage. For UHF and up, we present an attractive alternative to this solution, using discrete antennas in- or outside the tunnel, depending on the tunnel's length. The key to coverage predictions is a \"critical distance\", after which higher-order modes excited near the antenna have died out. This distance depends on tunnel cross-section dimensions and wavelength. A propagation model using this critical distance can predict power level versus length for distances larger than the critical one (e.g. 300 m for 900 MHz in a Euro-standard dual-lane tunnel). Two reference measurements are needed as input for the prediction. Validation measurements taken in a dual-lane road tunnel at 900 and 1800 MHz showed the prediction to be useful at various traffic rates. Traffic does not significantly hamper propagation, if only the vehicles leave enough space in the cross section, nor do bends with curvature radii commonly used in motorway tunnels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/529121/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5145131","conferenceDate":"18-23 Sept. 1994","displayDocTitle":"Radio coverage of road tunnels at 900 and 1800 MHz by discrete antennas","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio coverage of road tunnels at 900 and 1800 MHz by discrete antennas","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00529121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02972S","chronDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","isNumber":"11646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4069","citationCount":"31","articleId":"529121","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":529122,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

A modified multi-stage co-channel interference cancellation technique is proposed for asynchronous CDMA. In asynchronous CDMA a desired bit of any user is affected by co-channel interference from two bits from all other users. In the first stage of interference cancellation, by the end of the integration period of a desired bit, each interfering user would have already obtained an estimate for the earliest of its two interfering bits. Hence, the interference contributed by this bit can be rebuilt and subtracted from the conventional matched filter decision statistic of the desired bit. In the second stage, after waiting a period equals to a bit duration, the remaining bits would have been estimated using a first stage cancellation. Their interference can then be rebuilt and canceled. Also the interference that has been canceled in the first stage can be re-canceled using the estimates of the second stage of other users. This system is shown to provide a good performance. It is assumed that the received powers, delays and phases of all users are perfectly attained.","doi":"10.1109/WNCMF.1994.529124","publicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Wireless Networks - Catching the Mobile Future.","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Wireless Networks - Catching the Mobile Future.","pdfPath":"/iel2/4069/11646/00529124.pdf","startPage":"425","endPage":"429 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WNCMF.1994.529124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A modified multi-stage co-channel interference cancellation in asynchronous CDMA systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","conferenceDate":"18-23 Sept. 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/529124/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"A modified multi-stage co-channel interference cancellation in asynchronous CDMA systems","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5145134","volume":"2","publicationDate":"1994","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A modified multi-stage co-channel interference cancellation in asynchronous CDMA systems","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00529124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034799S","chronDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","isNumber":"11646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4069","citationCount":"6","articleId":"529124","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":529125,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The developed LSIC satisfies CCITT recommendation G.721 completely and is suitable for realizing the high-quality voice signal transmission expected from personal communication systems in fading environments. By employing a time sharing signal processing, a very low power consumption (only 500 /spl mu/W) for ADPCM codec core has been achieved. Moreover, the LSIC has a novel click noise detection function and erroneous received signals are suppressed digitally according to the click noise detection information. This makes it possible to improve the voice transmission quality significantly in fading environments, for instance, the MOS (mean opinion score) evaluation is improved by 0.5 points compared with that of the conventional scheme.","publicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Wireless Networks - Catching the Mobile Future.","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Wireless Networks - Catching the Mobile Future.","pdfPath":"/iel2/4069/11646/00529136.pdf","startPage":"481","endPage":"485 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A very low power consumption ADPCM voice codec LSIC for personal communication systems","doi":"10.1109/WNCMF.1994.529136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11646","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WNCMF.1994.529136","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=529136","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/529136/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"A very low power consumption ADPCM voice codec LSIC for personal communication systems","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5145146","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"18-23 Sept. 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A very low power consumption ADPCM voice codec LSIC for personal communication systems","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00529136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051275S","chronDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","isNumber":"11646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4069","citationCount":"3","articleId":"529136","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":529137,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The application of both CRAD and a novel convolutional code termed the turbo-code to the uplink of a joint detection (JD) code division multiple access (CDMA) mobile radio system is considered. New results on the coded error performance obtained by using the well-known powerful JD techniques zero forcing block decision feedback equalization, minimum mean square error block linear equalization, and minimum mean square error block decision feedback equalization, which were extended to CRAD with maximal-ratio combining, are presented when either one or two receiver antennas are applied. Both bit and frame error rates, respectively, are introduced and compared with formerly published results. The performance enhancement is demonstrated. Furthermore, it is shown that there is a linear dependence between the bit as well as frame error rate and the variance of the log-likelihood ratios generated by the turbo-code decoder. Therefore, the turbo-code decoder can provide information about the current system performance by estimating the variance of the log-likelihood ratios.","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Wireless Networks - Catching the Mobile Future.","pdfPath":"/iel2/4069/11646/00529145.pdf","startPage":"524","endPage":"528 vol.2","publicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Wireless Networks - Catching the Mobile Future.","doi":"10.1109/WNCMF.1994.529145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WNCMF.1994.529145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11646","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=529145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New results on the application of antenna diversity and turbo-codes in a JD-CDMA mobile radio system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Turbo codes","Diversity reception","Decision feedback equalizers","Receiving antennas","Land mobile radio","Multiaccess communication","Mean square error methods","Error analysis","Decoding","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","land mobile radio","digital radio","code division multiple access","channel coding","receiving antennas","convolutional codes","decoding","signal detection","coding errors","error statistics","decision feedback equalisers","interference suppression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","interference suppression","JD-CDMA mobile radio system","coherent receiver antenna diversity","CRAD","digital mobile radio systems","convolutional code","uplink","joint detection","code division multiple access","coded error performance","zero forcing block decision feedback equalization","MMSE block linear equalization","MMSE block decision feedback equalization","maximal-ratio combining","receiver antennas","frame error rates","bit error rates","log-likelihood ratios","turbo-code decoder","system performance","variance estimation","minimum mean square error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/529145/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"New results on the application of antenna diversity and turbo-codes in a JD-CDMA mobile radio system","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5145155","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-23 Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New results on the application of antenna diversity and turbo-codes in a JD-CDMA mobile radio system","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00529145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043439S","chronDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","isNumber":"11646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4069","citationCount":"4","articleId":"529145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":529146,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The proposed asynchronous CDMA adaptive decorrelator consists of a bank of matched filters (matched to the users' signature sequences), followed by a sampler at the bit-rate of 1/T and controllable weights.

CDMA system performance is normally interference limited, and individual users typically experience the average performance over all users. This is particularly true in a Gaussian, additive white noise channel, with many users, sufficient processing gain, and effective power control. In this case, the other users appear as Gaussian noise and each user experiences the same environment. Under fading channel conditions however, the average behavior notion is flawed, since the fade conditions for each user are different, even if the fading statistics are identical. An alternative measure of performance under these conditions is the probability of outage. For coded signals, the fading must be averaged over all the symbols in the codeword. For properly interleaved signals and i.i.d. Rayleigh fade statistics, the average must be performed over a chi-squared variate.

The uplinks and downlinks of all satellites use code-division multiple-access (CDMA) with direct-sequence spread-spectrum (DS/SS) signaling. The satellites act as bent-pipes; no on-board processing or intersatellite links are present. Dual satellite diversity is used to mitigate the effects of shadowing. The authors find an optimal CDMA code allocation policy by minimizing a cost function consisting of the weighted sum of the blocking rates of voice and data traffic subject to performance requirements (bit error rates) of the two traffic types. The relative priority of voice and data can be adjusted via a weighting factor. The activity factor of the voice traffic (talkspurts and silent periods) is taken into account to increase bandwidth efficiency. The code allocation policy has the form of a movable voice/data boundary in the CDMA code domain.","doi":"10.1109/WNCMF.1994.529157","publicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Wireless Networks - Catching the Mobile Future.","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Wireless Networks - Catching the Mobile Future.","pdfPath":"/iel2/4069/11646/00529157.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WNCMF.1994.529157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11646","startPage":"584","endPage":"589 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic CDMA code allocation for voice and data traffic in networks of LEO satellites","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=529157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic CDMA code allocation for voice and data traffic in networks of LEO satellites","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/529157/","conferenceDate":"18-23 Sept. 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5155601","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic CDMA code allocation for voice and data traffic in networks of LEO satellites","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00529157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060762S","chronDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","isNumber":"11646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4069","articleId":"529157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":529158,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In practical cases the intermodulation to signal ratio in CDMA is only slightly lower than that in FDMA.

The performed simulations are based on this expression and on a simple but meaningful mobility which also considers hot cells where mobile users tend to accumulate. Two mechanisms for limiting the negative effects yielded by the bursty user mobility are presented. Such mechanisms aim at preventing the accumulation of a large amount of mobile users in a given cell, thus limiting the occurrence of situations in which the self-noise is so high that the target quality requirements are not met (i.e. the link is unavailable). The consequent increase in link availability takes place at the expense of the rising of non-null blocking and dropping probabilities. In this view, an optimization process is presented which achieves the maximum capacity while satisfying the given performance targets.","doi":"10.1109/WNCMF.1994.529166","publicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Wireless Networks - Catching the Mobile Future.","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Wireless Networks - Catching the Mobile Future.","pdfPath":"/iel2/4069/11646/00529166.pdf","startPage":"635","endPage":"639 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WNCMF.1994.529166","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Handling of user mobility in a CDMA cellular network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=529166","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/529166/","displayDocTitle":"Handling of user mobility in a CDMA cellular network","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5155610","conferenceDate":"18-23 Sept. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Handling of user mobility in a CDMA cellular network","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00529166.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038153S","chronDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","isNumber":"11646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4069","citationCount":"3","articleId":"529166","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":529171,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In this paper, a novel adaptive channel precoder is proposed to improve the system performance with-out increasing the complexity of the portable unit. In the forward link, both the amplitude and phase of the signal carrier are predistorted at the transmitter of the base station, so that the signal received at the portable unit is ISI free (in the ideal case). The precoding is based on channel information estimated (from the reverse link) at the receiver of the base station. Computer simulation results demonstrate that, over a two-path Rayleigh fading channel, differential QPSK with the precoder has significantly lower BER values than those with a conventional decision feedback equalizer (DFE), because the precoder is not subject to error propagation.","doi":"10.1109/WNCMF.1994.529171","publicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Wireless Networks - Catching the Mobile Future.","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Wireless Networks - Catching the Mobile Future.","pdfPath":"/iel2/4069/11646/00529171.pdf","startPage":"660","endPage":"664 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WNCMF.1994.529171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive channel precoding for slowly fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=529171","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/529171/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive channel precoding for slowly fading channels","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5155615","conferenceDate":"18-23 Sept. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive channel precoding for slowly fading channels","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00529171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088869S","chronDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","isNumber":"11646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4069","citationCount":"6","articleId":"529171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":529178,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The work focuses on the two types of diversity, frequency and path, which are offered only by wideband communications systems. For this reason a geometric propagation channel model is developed enabling the performance study of frequency-selective channels to be carried out at their operating frequencies; i.e. at bandpass. The channel model provides the transfer function and parameters such as coherence bandwidth and multipath spread of broadband channels. Based on these transfer functions the time responses of communication channels, separated by one or more signalling bandwidths, are compared and statistically quantified. The results indicate that, depending on the channel bandwidth, there is considerable correlation between broadband communications which are centred at different carrier frequencies. The high correlation between the different broadband channels can be used for propagation path-loss estimation for transmission power control applications in DS and hybrid CDMA systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broad-band propagation channel analysis for DS and hybrid CDMA system design","publicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Wireless Networks - Catching the Mobile Future.","doi":"10.1109/WNCMF.1994.529179","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Wireless Networks - Catching the Mobile Future.","pdfPath":"/iel2/4069/11646/00529179.pdf","startPage":"700","endPage":"704 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WNCMF.1994.529179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11646","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=529179","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/529179/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Broad-band propagation channel analysis for DS and hybrid CDMA system design","conferenceDate":"18-23 Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5155623","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broad-band propagation channel analysis for DS and hybrid CDMA system design","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00529179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05055S","chronDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","isNumber":"11646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4069","citationCount":"6","articleId":"529179","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":529180,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Couture","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Couture","id":"37355493500"},{"name":"J.-P.M.G.

In particular, the control of a double inverted pendulum has been known as a good example to show the power of the modern control theory. In this paper we consider about robust state transfer control method of a double pendulum, i.e., swing up control of the pendulum from the hanging position to the upright position. First, we propose a control method based on a energy principle. Secondly, a more robust control method in which the state transfer is realized through a limit cycle is presented. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is shown by the experiments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/529255/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1995","volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5032173","displayDocTitle":"Robust swing up control of double pendulum","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust swing up control of double pendulum","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00529255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030881S","chronDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11350","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3920","citationCount":"42","articleId":"529255","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":529257,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.

First, a one dimensional infinite horizon problem is examined. Problems involving cost functions with final state constraints are considered for one dimensional linear and nonlinear systems. A two dimensional linear problem is also investigated. In addition to these examples, an example of the corrective capabilities of critics is shown. Synthesis of the networks in this study needs no external training; they do not need any apriori knowledge of the functional form of control. Comparison with specific optimal control techniques show that the networks yield optimal control over the entire range of training.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.1995.529265","startPage":"335","endPage":"339 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","pdfPath":"/iel3/3920/11350/00529265.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.1995.529265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11350","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive critic based neural networks for control (low order system applications)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Neural networks","Control systems","Optimal control","Dynamic programming","Nonlinear systems","Adaptive systems","Infinite horizon","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["suboptimal control","control system synthesis","neurocontrollers","dynamic programming","nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive critic based neural networks","low-order system","dynamic programming","discretized system","nonlinear systems","adaptive neural networks","near-optimal control laws","control synthesis","one dimensional infinite horizon problem","1D infinite horizon problem","cost functions","final state constraints","two dimensional linear problem","2D linear problem","corrective capabilities"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/529265/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive critic based neural networks for control (low order system applications)","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1995","accessionNumber":"5032183","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive critic based neural networks for control (low order system applications)","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00529265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038602S","chronDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11350","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3920","citationCount":"11","articleId":"529265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":529269,"authors":[{"name":"K.S.

Passive learning refers to the normal situation in which the system inputs cannot be selected freely by the learning system; instead, function approximation must occur while the plant is in useful operation. Under these conditions, the experimental sample density is not expected to be uniform over the learning domain. The effect of the nonuniform sample density on the resulting parameter estimate is analyzed. It is shown that approximators that have orthonormal basis elements with local support can effectively accommodate nonuniform training sample distributions. Although such approximators require large amounts of memory, this paper shows that parameter estimation algorithms can be computed efficiently (i.e., on the order of the time required for a linear adaptive controller for a problem of the same state dimension) in real-time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/529373/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5032292","volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On the effects of the training sample density in passive learning control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the effects of the training sample density in passive learning control","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00529373.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043348S","chronDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11350","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3920","citationCount":"12","articleId":"529373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":529389,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This alternative is based upon the idea of transforming the l/sup 1/ problem into an equivalent (in the sense of having the same solution) mixed l/sup 1//H/sub /spl infin// problem that can be solved using convex optimization techniques. The proposed algorithm has the advantage of generating, at each step, an upper bound of the cost that converges uniformly to the optimal cost. Moreover, it allows for easily incorporating frequency and regional pole placement constraints. Finally, it does not require either solving large LP problems or obtaining the zero structure of the plant and computing the so-called zero interpolation and the rank interpolation conditions. The main drawback of this method is that it may suffer from order inflation. However, consistent numerical experience shows that the controllers obtained, albeit of high order, are amenable to model reduction by standard methods, with virtually no loss of performance.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.1995.529389","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","pdfPath":"/iel3/3920/11350/00529389.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.1995.529389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11350","startPage":"951","endPage":"955 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A solution to MIMO 4-block l/sup 1/ optimal control problems via convex optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=529389","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A solution to MIMO 4-block l/sup 1/ optimal control problems via convex optimization","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/529389/","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5032308","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A solution to MIMO 4-block l/sup 1/ optimal control problems via convex optimization","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00529389.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048229S","chronDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11350","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3920","citationCount":"3","articleId":"529389","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":529404,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Two completely different methods for the computation of the coefficients of the simulation model are discussed. The design of a fading channel model by one of the presented methods leads always to a simulation model that is completely determined for all time, and therefore, it can be considered as a deterministic model that approximates a stochastic process.","doi":"10.1109/WNCMF.1994.529445","publicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Wireless Networks - Catching the Mobile Future.","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Wireless Networks - Catching the Mobile Future.","pdfPath":"/iel2/4069/11648/00529445.pdf","startPage":"1202","endPage":"1210 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WNCMF.1994.529445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11648","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A deterministic model for a shadowed Rayleigh land mobile radio channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=529445","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/529445/","displayDocTitle":"A deterministic model for a shadowed Rayleigh land mobile radio channel","volume":"4","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5162473","conferenceDate":"18-23 Sept. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A deterministic model for a shadowed Rayleigh land mobile radio channel","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00529445.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05257S","chronDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","isNumber":"11648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4069","citationCount":"11","articleId":"529445","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":529449,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

The improved link utilisation is achieved by burst traffic statistically multiplexed on a wide bandwidth. Simulation study shows the significant increase in trunking efficiency. Principles of traffic control and resource management are suggested. Simulation results for homogeneous traffic multiplexing are presented. It shows how the maximum link utilisation is influenced by source utilisation, average burst length and peak-to-link ratio. It is concluded that higher bandwidth utilisation can only be achieved when peak-to-link ratios for a sufficient portion of the traffic are far smaller than 0.1. With this knowledge, the admission control function accepts connections according to their statistical parameters, so that both QOS and network performance are guaranteed.","publicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Wireless Networks - Catching the Mobile Future.","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Wireless Networks - Catching the Mobile Future.","pdfPath":"/iel2/4069/11648/00529454.pdf","startPage":"1254","endPage":"1259 vol.4","doi":"10.1109/WNCMF.1994.529454","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WNCMF.1994.529454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11648","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An extended packet reservation multiple access protocol for wireless multimedia communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/529454/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"An extended packet reservation multiple access protocol for wireless multimedia communication","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5162481","isConference":true,"volume":"4","conferenceDate":"18-23 Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An extended packet reservation multiple access protocol for wireless multimedia communication","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00529454.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037545S","chronDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","isNumber":"11648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4069","citationCount":"8","articleId":"529454","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":529458,"authors":[{"name":"A.H.

Computer simulation is an essential approach to assess the performance for mobile and portable communications. However, in the case of a low BER value or a slowly fading channel, computer simulation time can be prohibitively long in order to obtain an accurate BER estimate. This paper proposes a new adaptive importance sampling (AIS) technique for estimating the BER performance in an indoor wireless environment. The technique adaptively searches for optimal biased probability densities during the course of the simulation. The procedure of determining the optimal biased probability densities is simplified and the computer simulation time is considerably reduced.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","Bit error rate","Estimation error","Fading","Computer simulation","AWGN","Discrete event simulation","Performance analysis","Gaussian noise","Digital communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bit error rate estimation","slowly fading channels","adaptive importance sampling","BER performance","digital communications systems","portable communications","mobile communications","indoor wireless environment","optimal biased probability densities","computer simulation time"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WNCMF.1994.529468","publicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Wireless Networks - Catching the Mobile Future.","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Wireless Networks - Catching the Mobile Future.","pdfPath":"/iel2/4069/11648/00529468.pdf","startPage":"1330","endPage":"1334 vol.4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11648","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WNCMF.1994.529468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive importance sampling for bit error rate estimation in slowly fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=529468","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive importance sampling for bit error rate estimation in slowly fading channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/529468/","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5162494","conferenceDate":"18-23 Sept. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive importance sampling for bit error rate estimation in slowly fading channels","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00529468.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027024S","chronDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","isNumber":"11648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4069","citationCount":"1","articleId":"529468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":529469,"authors":[{"name":"Jinkang Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Radio & Electronic Engineering, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"lastName":"Jinkang Zhu","id":"37279939800"},{"name":"Xiaohong Wu","affiliation":["Department of Radio & Electronic Engineering, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"lastName":"Xiaohong Wu","id":"37351577400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"90-5199-193-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"529469","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"abstract":"A spread spectrum (SS) modulation method of the forward channel in cellular systems is proposed.

In addition to yielding highly accurate results, a benefit of this technique is the elimination of fractional-pixel interpolation and corresponding search. The technique is formulated in terms of a modified Hopfield neural network. The procedure consists of two stages: estimation of the neural network parameters from the present and previous frames, followed by the estimation of the affinity weights for the candidate macroblocks. The reconstructed macroblock then consists of the sum of the candidate macroblocks weighted by their affinity values as defined. Experiments on translational motion indicate that this technique produces a 5 dB higher peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) than the full search algorithm, 6 dB higher than the logarithmic block matching algorithms, and 2 dB higher than some of the very recent motion estimation algorithms. Preliminary experiments using the neural network affine algorithm on synthetically sheared images produce an 11 dB higher PSNR than the full search and LBM. Further, due to the neural network's fault tolerant nature and inherent parallelism, potential exists for VLSI implementation as an interconnection of small cells on a single chip.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1995.529735","pdfPath":"/iel3/4052/11606/00529735.pdf","startPage":"418","endPage":"421 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., International Conference on Image Processing","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., International Conference on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1995.529735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Affine motion estimation using a neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/529735/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"Affine motion estimation using a neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5241876","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Affine motion estimation using a neural network","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00529735.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03852S","chronDate":"23-26 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4052","citationCount":"4","articleId":"529735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":529736,"authors":[{"name":"R.N.

The DBNN adopts a hierarchical network structure with nonlinear basis functions and a competitive credit-assignment scheme. The face recognition system consists of three modules. First, a face detector finds the location of a human face in an image. Then an eye localizer determines the positions of both eyes to help generate size-normalized, reoriented, and reduced-resolution feature vectors. (The facial region proposed contains eyebrows, eyes, and nose, but excluding mouth. Eye-glasses will be permissible.) The last module is a face recognizer. The DBNN can be effectively applied to all the three modules. The DBNN based face recognizer has yielded very high recognition accuracies based on experiments on the ARPA-FERET and SCR-IM databases. In terms of processing speeds and recognition accuracies, the performance of DBNN is superior to that of multilayer perceptron (MLP). The training phase for 100 persons would take around one hour, while the recognition phase (including eye localization, feature extraction, and classification using DBNN) consumes only a fraction of a second (on Sparc10).","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1995.529738","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4052/11606/00529738.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1995.529738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11606","startPage":"430","endPage":"433 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decision-based neural network for face recognition system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=529738","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Decision-based neural network for face recognition system","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/529738/","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5241879","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decision-based neural network for face recognition system","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00529738.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03854S","chronDate":"23-26 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4052","citationCount":"14","articleId":"529738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":529748,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The paper shows how cellular neural networks (CNNs) incorporated with a learning algorithm can be useful in adaptive learning of the smoothing parameters of regularization. A CNN model is designed to minimize the regularization cost function which is in a quadratic form. The connection weights of this CNN are obtained by comparing the cost function with a Lyapunov function. Unlike the common approaches in the literature, instead of using the learning connection weights of the neural networks, we propose supervised learning of the regularization smoothing parameters by a modified version of the recurrent perceptron learning algorithm (RPLA) which is developed for completely stable CNNs operating in a bipolar binary output mode. It is concluded that CNNs with the RPLA provides a set of suitable smoothing parameters resulting in a robust restoration of noisy images. For comparison, experimental results obtained by a median filter are also reported.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1995.529748","startPage":"470","endPage":"473 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., International Conference on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1995.529748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11606","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4052/11606/00529748.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supervised learning of smoothing parameters in image restoration by regularization under cellular neural networks framework","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/529748/","displayDocTitle":"Supervised learning of smoothing parameters in image restoration by regularization under cellular neural networks framework","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5241889","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Oct 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supervised learning of smoothing parameters in image restoration by regularization under cellular neural networks framework","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00529748.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033304S","chronDate":"23-26 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4052","articleId":"529748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":529753,"authors":[{"name":"E.L.

The 5-cell faults represent either unlinked scrambled active physical neighborhood pattern-sensitive faults (PNPSFs), or arbitrary combinations of unlinked scrambled active, static, and passive PNPSFs. The BIST scheme uses a modified version of Nicolaidis' method to make the applied tests transparent; thus the data that were held in the RAM at the start of the test will be restored by the end of the test, if no faults are present. All single faults of the above fault types, as well as most other standard fault types, are guaranteed to be detected because of the use of an aliasing-free signature analyzer.

The success of any design methods which attempt to ensure such stability hinge on the suitability and quality of the timing data upon which the design decisions are based. For clock signals, there are a variety of metrics of stability (peak, cycle-to-cycle, etc.). Furthermore, the widespread use of PLL devices for the distribution and reception of clocks necessitates other measurement types, such as modulation spectrum. This paper presents a comparative discussion of methods of measuring low-amplitude jitter, and other related behavior such as modulation spectrum. It compares \"front-panel\" oscilloscope-based methods, and time-interval analyzer and counter-based methods. It then describes a method of post-processing oscilloscope data in ways that are more accurate and useful to the design process than is possible from the scope's front panel.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.1995.529893","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Test Conference (ITC)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Test Conference (ITC)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4046/11600/00529893.pdf","startPage":"646","endPage":"652","doi":"10.1109/TEST.1995.529893","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A discussion of methods for measuring low-amplitude jitter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"A discussion of methods for measuring low-amplitude jitter","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 Oct. 1995","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5254193","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/529893/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A discussion of methods for measuring low-amplitude jitter","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00529893.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034088S","chronDate":"21-25 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4046","citationCount":"6","articleId":"529893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":529895,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.

The premise is that when a circuit switches states, a temporary path is established between power and ground which results in a transient current. With proper power tree distribution, observing this transient current provides direct insight into the switching pattern of a circuit under a given stimulus. This paper includes an overall summary of physical experiments that have been conducted (previously reported in parts) as well as new results on the test overhead. The physical experimental results show i/sub DDT/ to be effective in detecting disturb faults in SRAMs and drain/ source opens in general CMOS logic structures.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Test Conference (ITC)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4046/11600/00529922.pdf","startPage":"892","endPage":"901","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Test Conference (ITC)","doi":"10.1109/TEST.1995.529922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.1995.529922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11600","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=529922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transient power supply current testing of digital CMOS circuits","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit testing","Current supplies","Power supplies","CMOS digital integrated circuits","Switching circuits","Integrated circuit testing","Observability","Switches","Electrical fault detection","Fault detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit testing","CMOS logic circuits","logic testing","SRAM chips","automatic testing","production testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transient power supply current","power supply current testing","digital CMOS circuits","switching behaviour","temporary path","power tree distribution","switching pattern","test overhead","disturb faults","SRAMs","drain/ source opens","CMOS logic structures"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/529922/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"Transient power supply current testing of digital CMOS circuits","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5266978","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-25 Oct. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transient power supply current testing of digital CMOS circuits","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00529922.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053479S","chronDate":"21-25 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4046","citationCount":"50","articleId":"529922","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":529940,"authors":[{"name":"M.

These algorithms have been devised for cold plasma (isotropic and anisotropic), Debye, Lorentz media, etc. Essentially, the methodologies are either convolution based, which discretizes the constitutive convolution integral, or direct integration based, which discretizes an auxiliary set of equations. Although all schemes have been shown to yield good results, for a certain selection of numerical discretization parameters, it is not clear which method leads to more accurate solutions, all other things being equal. We present various analyses that highlight the dispersive and dissipation errors created by each of the discretization schemes, namely, those of Luebbers et al. (1990, 1992), Joseph et al. (1991) and Young (see IEEE Trans. Ant. and Prop., Nov. 1994). This is accomplished by considering the dispersive relationship of each method with Debye and Lorentz media in mind.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1995 Digest","pdfPath":"/iel3/3934/11384/00529999.pdf","startPage":"216","endPage":"219 vol.1","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1995 Digest","doi":"10.1109/APS.1995.529999","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1995.529999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11384","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=529999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dispersion analyses of FDTD schemes associated with dispersive media","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Dispersion","Permittivity","Convolution","Maxwell equations","Plasmas","Resonant frequency","Damping","Differential equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dispersion (wave)","electromagnetic wave propagation","finite difference time-domain analysis","error analysis","electromagnetic wave scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dispersion analyses","FDTD","dispersive media","finite difference time domain algorithm","frequency-dependent media","cold plasma","anisotropic plasma","isotropic plasma","convolution integral","integration","numerical discretization parameters","dissipation errors","dispersive errors","Lorentz media","Debye media","EM wave propagation","EM wave scattering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/529999/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 June 1995","displayDocTitle":"Dispersion analyses of FDTD schemes associated with dispersive media","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5199544","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-23 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dispersion analyses of FDTD schemes associated with dispersive media","confLoc":"Newport Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00529999.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059316S","chronDate":"18-23 June 1995","isNumber":"11384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3934","articleId":"529999","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"}]
