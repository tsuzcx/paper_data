In this paper, we present an extension of the well-known recursive least-squares algorithm for adaptive filters to widely-linear complex-valued signal and system modeling. The widely-linear RLS algorithm exploits a structured covariance matrix update that maintains information about the non-circularity of the input data to solve the widely-linear least-squares task at each snapshot. In addition, the WL-RLS algorithm can easily be switched between conventional and widely-linear complex modeling as needed. Application of the method to adaptive beamforming of mixed BPSK and QPSK signal transmissions shows that the system can extract all of the transmitted signal outputs in certain overloaded scenarios, and it performs up to 3 dB better than the conventional RLS beamformer when the array is not overloaded.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960015.pdf","startPage":"2041","endPage":"2044","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960015","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960015","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Widely-linear recursive least-squares algorithm for adaptive beamforming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Adaptive filters","Linear antenna arrays","Sensor arrays","Adaptive arrays","Resonance light scattering","Adaptive systems","Recursive estimation","Nonlinear filters","Filtering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","array signal processing","covariance matrices","least mean squares methods","phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recursive least-squares algorithm","adaptive beamforming","adaptive filter","widely-linear RLS algorithm","covariance matrix","BPSK signal transmission","QPSK signal transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["adaptive arrays","adaptive filters","adaptive systems","least squares methods","recursive estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960015/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Widely-linear recursive least-squares algorithm for adaptive beamforming","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960015/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10700979","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Widely-linear recursive least-squares algorithm for adaptive beamforming","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058987S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4960018,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Bertrand","affiliation":["Department ESAT, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Bertrand","id":"37624391700"},{"name":"Marc Moonen","affiliation":["Department ESAT, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Moonen","id":"37274397700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960018","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive estimation","Signal processing algorithms","Acoustic sensors","Convergence","Signal processing","Wireless sensor networks","Bandwidth","Acoustic measurements","Speech enhancement","Parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive estimation","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed adaptive estimation","correlated node-specific signals","distributed adaptive estimation algorithm","wireless sensor network","sensor measurements","optimal linear estimator","speech enhancement","acoustic sensor networks","communication bandwidth"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed estimation","wireless sensor networks (WSNs)","adaptive estimation","distributed compression"]}],"abstract":"We introduce a distributed adaptive estimation algorithm operating in an ideal fully connected sensor network.

Numerical simulations illustrate that the proposed field reconstruction scheme outperforms band-limited reconstruction, even though the latter has much larger complexity.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Wireless sensor networks","Space technology","Numerical simulation","Remote monitoring","Nonlinear filters","Intelligent networks","Radio frequency","Clustering algorithms","Spline"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal sampling","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed sampling","shift-invariant space","nonbandlimited field reconstruction","wireless sensor network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless sensor network","field reconstruction","shift-invariant space","B-splines"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960020","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960020.pdf","startPage":"2061","endPage":"2064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960020","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed sampling and reconstruction of non-bandlimited fields in sensor networks based on shift-invariant spaces","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960020","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed sampling and reconstruction of non-bandlimited fields in sensor networks based on shift-invariant spaces","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960020/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960020/","accessionNumber":"10700984","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed sampling and reconstruction of non-bandlimited fields in sensor networks based on shift-invariant spaces","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063296S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960020","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4960023,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Yang Chen","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chun-Yang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293085800"},{"name":"P.

This provides extra degrees of freedom compared to the traditional transmit beamforming approach. It has been shown in the recent literature that MIMO radar systems have many advantages. In this paper, we consider the joint optimization of waveforms and receiving filters in the MIMO radar when the prior information of target and clutter are available. A novel iterative algorithm is proposed to optimize the waveforms and receiving filters such that the detection performance can be maximized. The proposed algorithm guarantees that the SINR performance improves in each iteration step.

However it has been recently shown that with the help of the rectangular smart antenna array, it is possible to generate frequency invariant beampattern without using filters. In this paper, this frequency invariant beamforming technique is utilized to perform MVDR beamforming in the beamspace by designing frequency invariant beams spanning the desired range of azimuthal angles and optimally combining them. However, the performance of the frequency invariant beamformer depends on the number of sensors which could be large for a rectangular array of size M times N. Making use of the virtual array concept used in MIMO radar, a novel method of producing the same frequency invariant beam, using only M transmitting and N receiving antennas, is proposed and a design example is provided to demonstrate the idea.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency invariant MVDR beamforming without filters and implementation using MIMO radar","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960025","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960025.pdf","startPage":"2081","endPage":"2084","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960025","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960025/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Frequency invariant MVDR beamforming without filters and implementation using MIMO radar","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960025/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701045","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency invariant MVDR beamforming without filters and implementation using MIMO radar","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053137S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960025","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4960026,"authors":[{"name":"T.

estimation of quasi-stationary signals via Khatri-Rao subspace","abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation of quasi-stationary signals, which finds applications in array processing of speech and audio. By studying the subspace structures of the local second-order statistics (SOSs) of quasi-stationary signals, we develop a Khatri-Rao (KR) subspace approach that has two notable advantages. First, the approach can operate in underdetermined cases. It is proven that if N is the number of sensors in the array, then the proposed approach can identify up to 2N - 2 source DOAs in an unambiguous fashion. Second, the approach can handle the problem of unknown noise covariance. Essentially, the KR subspace formulation is found to provide a simple and effective way of annihilating the (unknown) noise covariance from the observed signal SOSs. Simulation results, with an emphasis on underdetermined and colored-noise cases, illustrate that the KR subspace approach provides promising mean square estimation error performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960046/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4960046/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10701121","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"DOA estimation of quasi-stationary signals via Khatri-Rao subspace","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DOA estimation of quasi-stationary signals via Khatri-Rao subspace","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002165.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046411S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960046","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4960047,"authors":[{"name":"Walid Hachem","affiliation":["CNRS/Telecom ParisTech (ENST), France"],"firstName":"Walid","lastName":"Hachem","id":"37272067300"},{"name":"Eric Moulines","affiliation":["CNRS/Telecom ParisTech (ENST), France"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Moulines","id":"37294534400"},{"name":"Jamal Najim","affiliation":["CNRS/Telecom ParisTech (ENST), France"],"firstName":"Jamal","lastName":"Najim","id":"37403635500"},{"name":"Francois Roueff","affiliation":["CNRS/Telecom ParisTech (ENST), France"],"firstName":"Francois","lastName":"Roueff","id":"37590815400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960047","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diffusion processes","Testing","Sampling methods","Stochastic resonance","Differential equations","Error probability","Difference equations","Telecommunications","Random processes","Sensor phenomena and characterization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential equations","distributed sensors","signal sampling","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error exponents","randomly sampled noisy diffusion processes","continuous random process detection","Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic differential equation","randomly spaced sensors","random time sampler","noisy O-U process","fixed false alarm probability","type II error probability","random sampling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Error Exponents","Neyman-Pearson Detection","Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Processes","Sensor Networks","Stability of Markov Processes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960047","abstract":"This paper deals with the detection of a continuous random process described by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (O-U) stochastic differential equation.

For the case of sampling a diffusion field, we show that, to achieve trade-off between spatial and temporal sampling, the spatial arrangement of the sensors must satisfy certain conditions.

Therefore, a sensible approach to select the nodes should not only take into account the required beampattern, but also should aim to preserve the inter-node connectivity and the network energy. We show for a uniformly distributed WSN that when the nodes are selected from a ring of proper radii, the resulting beampattern mainlobe is narrower compared to that of the classical DBF technique proposed in [1]. At the same time, our proposed technique may preserve a substantial amount of network energy and reduce the probability of network disconnectivity. Directivity of the proposed DBF technique is analyzed and an extension of the technique to a multi-ring case is presented. It is shown that the sidelobe peaks can be considerably decreased if the nodes are selected from multiple concentric rings.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960070/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10701199","htmlLink":"/document/4960070/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Distributed beamforming for wireless sensor networks with random node location","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed beamforming for wireless sensor networks with random node location","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002261.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072177S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4960071,"authors":[{"name":"Haihua Chen","affiliation":["Communication Systems Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Haihua","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281185400"},{"name":"Alex B.

In these challenging economic times, it is somewhat reassuring to know that some unstable financial accounts are actually a good thing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The DSP of money","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960082","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960082.pdf","startPage":"2309","endPage":"2312","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960082","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960082/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"The DSP of money","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960082/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701267","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The DSP of money","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002309.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029352S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960082","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4960087,"authors":[{"name":"Feifei Gao","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Feifei","lastName":"Gao","id":"37289304900"},{"name":"Rui Zhang","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37274563900"},{"name":"Ying-Chang Liang","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ying-Chang","lastName":"Liang","id":"37275171800"},{"name":"Xiaodong Wang","affiliation":["Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaodong Wang","id":"37087144898"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960087","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":256},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chromium","Interference","Array signal processing","Data communication","Transmitting antennas","Channel estimation","Frequency","Receiving antennas","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel estimation","cognitive radio","data communication","mean square error methods","multibeam antennas","radio links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiantenna cognitive radio systems","environmental learning","channel training","primary radio link","CR data transmission","partial channel information","transmit beamforming strategy","receive beamforming strategy","optimal balancing","mean square error","channel estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","transmit beamforming","receive beamforming","learning","channel training"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a multi-antenna cognitive radio (CR) system that is capable of operating concurrently with the primary radio (PR) link. The operation of the CR system consists of three stages: environmental learning, CR channel training and CR data transmission. In environmental learning stage, partial channel information between PR and CR are obtained blindly, based on which the transmit beamforming and the receive beamforming strategies are designed at CR to remove/reduce the interference to and from PR, respectively. We characterize all the interference values analytically and study the problem of learning/training tradeoff associated with the proposed scheme. The optimal balancing between learning and training is examined via the minimum mean square error (MSE) of the channel estimation. It is shown that for a given total learning/training time, there indeed exists a optimal learning time that minimizes the MSE of the channel estimation, yet the interference power to the PR is regulated.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960087","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960087.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","startPage":"2329","endPage":"2332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-antenna cognitive radio systems: Environmental learning and channel training","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960087","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-antenna cognitive radio systems: Environmental learning and channel training","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960087/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701272","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4960087/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-antenna cognitive radio systems: Environmental learning and channel training","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002329.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073557S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4960088,"authors":[{"name":"Erik Axell","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering (ISY), Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Axell","id":"37586919900"},{"name":"Erik G.

The proposed cooperation model has two major traits; first, by opportunistically and dynamically assigning one of the destination nodes as relay for the other one, via a single-time relaying both destinations achieves a second order diversity gain. Secondly, it guarantees performance improvement over all SNR regimes, which is not the case in most cooperation protocols as diversity gain is a high SNR measure and yielding higher diversity orders ensures improvement only over high enough SNRs. Next, we consider cognitive users, to whom the codebook of the primary users is known as side information, and offer a beacon-assisted mechanism for spectrum access. We assume that a primary user multicasts a beacon message upon releasing a spectrum band and adopt the proposed cooperation model to strengthen a cognitive transmitter-receiver pair in decoding the beacon message. Finally, we quantify the effect of such cooperation on the capacity of the channel between the cognitive transmitter-receiver pair, as a meaningful measure to assess how the proposed cooperation model assists the secondary users in exploiting communication opportunities.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960090","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960090.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960090","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","startPage":"2341","endPage":"2344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beacon-assisted spectrum access with cooperative cognitive transmitter and receiver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960090","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Beacon-assisted spectrum access with cooperative cognitive transmitter and receiver","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960090/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960090/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701275","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beacon-assisted spectrum access with cooperative cognitive transmitter and receiver","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054935S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960090","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4960091,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohua Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of New York, Binghamton, Binghamton, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaohua","lastName":"Li","id":"37280865500"},{"name":"Juite Hwu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of New York, Binghamton, Binghamton, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Juite","lastName":"Hwu","id":"37628893200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960091","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":404},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spread spectrum communication","Cognitive radio","White spaces","Interference","Frequency synchronization","Frequency shift keying","Data security","Feedback","Performance analysis","Radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","frequency hop communication","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency hopping spread spectrum transmission scheme","uncoordinated cognitive radios","distributed radios","spectrum white spaces","a priori handshaking assumption","white space detection","spectrum sensing accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","dynamic spectrum access","frequency hopping","frequency shift keying","synchronization"]}],"abstract":"One of the major challenges to cognitive radios is the synchronization of distributed radios onto the same spectrum white spaces which vary in time and space.

While exploiting the reliability of the white space detection capability of cognitive radios, the new scheme is robust to even large detection errors.

A dual decomposition approach is exploited to construct a distributed structure for solving the bargaining problem.

In this paper, we present the joint design of linear transmit and receive beamformers that maximize the weighted harmonic mean signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) for the downlink of the multiuser MIMO channel. By exploiting the uplink-downlink SINR duality, the non-convex optimization problem is transformed into a series of simpler problems which can be solved by geometric programming. When the minimum mean square error (MMSE) receive beamformers are employed, it is shown that the harmonic mean SINR maximization becomes a close approximation to the sum MSE minimization problem in the high SINR region. The simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms other leakage-based schemes in terms of harmonic mean SINR, sum MSE, BER and sum rate.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960100","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960100.pdf","startPage":"2381","endPage":"2384","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weighted harmonic mean SINR maximization for the MIMO downlink","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960100","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960100/","displayDocTitle":"Weighted harmonic mean SINR maximization for the MIMO downlink","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701356","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960100/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighted harmonic mean SINR maximization for the MIMO downlink","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002381.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063871S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4960101,"authors":[{"name":"River Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California Davis, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"River","lastName":"Huang","id":"37629375900"},{"name":"Zhi Ding","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California,\uc2a0Davis, Davis, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Zhi Ding","id":"37278651400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960101","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Broadcasting","Signal design","Interference constraints","Signal processing algorithms","Broadband antennas","Transmitting antennas","Signal processing","Algorithm design and analysis","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","convex programming","interference suppression","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","precoding","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO broadcast channels","power leakage constraints","MIMO linear precoders","multiuser broadcast channels","signal leakage constraints","interference suppression","radio receivers","convex optimization","semidefinite program","spatial diversity","multiuser diversity","space time transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO systems","power leakage","precoding"]}],"abstract":"We investigate the design of MIMO linear precoders for multiuser broadcast channels under signal leakage constraints.

Unlike previous work that assumes some prior knowledge of the eavesdropper's channel and focuses on the information theoretic concept of secrecy capacity, we also consider the case where no information regarding the eavesdropper is present, and we use the relative signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) of a single transmitted data stream as our performance metric. A portion of the transmit power is used to broadcast the information signal with just enough power to guarantee a certain SINR at the desired receiver, and the remainder of the power is used to broadcast artificial noise in order to mask the desired signal from a potential eavesdropper. The interference is designed to be orthogonal to the information signal when it reaches the desired receiver, and we study the resulting relative SINR of the desired receiver and the eavesdropper assuming both employ optimal beamformers.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960114.pdf","startPage":"2437","endPage":"2440","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fixed SINR solutions for the MIMO wiretap channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Interference","Transmitters","Broadcasting","Wireless communication","Cryptography","Degradation","Transmitting antennas","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","channel capacity","MIMO communication","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication security","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO wiretap channel","multiple input multiple output systems","artificial interference","multiantenna node","eavesdropper channel","information theoretic concept","optimal beamformer","secure communication","secrecy capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO wiretap channel","secrecy capacity","secure communications","interference alignment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960114/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fixed SINR solutions for the MIMO wiretap channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960114/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701445","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fixed SINR solutions for the MIMO wiretap channel","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002437.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063949S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"136","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960114","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4960116,"authors":[{"name":"Steven W.

Unfortunately, closed-form solutions for interference alignment over constant-coefficient channels with more than 3 users are difficult to derive. This paper proposes an algorithm for interference alignment in the MIMO interference channel with an arbitrary number of users, antennas, or spatial streams. The algorithm is an alternating minimization over the precoding matrices at the transmitters and the interference subspaces at the receivers, and is proven to converge. Numerical results show how the algorithm is useful for simulation and can give insight into the limitations of interference alignment.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960116.pdf","startPage":"2445","endPage":"2448","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference alignment via alternating minimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Interference channels","Frequency","Closed-form solution","Receivers","Radio transmitters","Covariance matrix","Resistance heating","Heat engines","Minimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference (signal)","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","numerical analysis","radio transmitters","transceivers","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference alignment","alternating minimization","degrees of freedom","closed-form solutions","constant-coefficient channels","MIMO interference channel","precoding matrices","transmitters","interference subspaces","receivers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO systems","Interference","Radio communication","Multiuser channels","Optimization methods"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960116/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Interference alignment via alternating minimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960116/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701447","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference alignment via alternating minimization","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002445.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035525S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"313","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960116","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4960117,"authors":[{"name":"Anthony Man-Cho So","affiliation":["Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Anthony Man-Cho","lastName":"So","id":"37410192000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960117","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Detectors","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Computational efficiency","Phase shift keying","Binary phase shift keying","Constellation diagram","Signal to noise ratio","Approximation algorithms","Signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","phase shift keying","probability","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO detectors","QAM constellations","semidefinite relaxation","binary phase-shift keying","BPSK","quadrature amplitude modulation","signal-to-noise ratio","constant factor approximation","optimal log-likelihood value","probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Detection","Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)","Semidefinite Relaxation","Performance Analysis","Approximation Algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Due to their computational efficiency and strong empirical performance, semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based algorithms have gained much attention in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection. In the case of a binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) constellation, the theoretical performance of the SDR approach is relatively well-understood. However, little is known about the case of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations, although simulation results suggest that the SDR approach should work well in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region. In this paper we make a first step towards explaining such phenomenon by showing that in the case of QAM constellations, several commonly used SDR-based algorithms will provide a constant factor approximation to the optimal log-likelihood value in the low SNR region with exponentially high probability. Our result gives some theoretical justification for using SDR-based algorithms for the MIMO detection of QAM signals, at least in the low SNR region.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960117","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960117.pdf","startPage":"2449","endPage":"2452","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance of semidefinite relaxation MIMO detectors for QAM constellations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960117","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960117/","displayDocTitle":"On the performance of semidefinite relaxation MIMO detectors for QAM constellations","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701448","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960117/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance of semidefinite relaxation MIMO detectors for QAM constellations","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002449.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07533S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4960118,"authors":[{"name":"Balakumar Balasingam","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Balakumar","lastName":"Balasingam","id":"37645880800"},{"name":"Miodrag Bolic","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Miodrag","lastName":"Bolic","id":"37396308000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960118","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Monte Carlo methods","Maximum likelihood decoding","Computational complexity","Approximation algorithms","Maximum likelihood estimation","Parameter estimation","Performance analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","computational complexity","maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind decoding","OSTBC","MIMO systems","sequential Monte-Carlo methods","computational complexity","approximation techniques","interlaced maximum likelihood estimator","statistical parameters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","OSTBC","Kalman filter","Marginalized particle filter (MPF)","Sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, blind decoding of OSTBC based MIMO systems using sequential Monte-Carlo methods is considered.

It is used to estimate parameters from multiple noisy observations. In many problems the parameters are known a-priori to be bounded integer valued, or they come from a finite set of values on an arbitrary finite lattice. In this case finding the closest vector becomes NP-Hard problem. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm, the Tomographic Least Squares Decoder (TLSD), that not only solves the ILS problem, better than other sub-optimal techniques, but also is capable of providing the a-posteriori probability distribution for each element in the solution vector. The algorithm is based on reconstruction of the vector from multiple two-dimensional projections. The projections are carefully chosen to provide low computational complexity. Unlike other iterative techniques, such as the belief propagation, the proposed algorithm has ensured convergence. We also provide simulated experiments comparing the algorithm to other sub-optimal algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960119","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960119.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","startPage":"2457","endPage":"2460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO decoding based on stochastic reconstruction from multiple projections","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960119","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO decoding based on stochastic reconstruction from multiple projections","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960119/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701450","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4960119/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO decoding based on stochastic reconstruction from multiple projections","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002457.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065056S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4960120,"authors":[{"name":"Ni-Chun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ni-Chun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37630949500"},{"name":"Ezio Biglieri","affiliation":["Departament de Tecnologies de la Informaci\u00f3 i les Comunicacions, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Ezio","lastName":"Biglieri","id":"37269642000"},{"name":"Kung Yao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kung","lastName":"Yao","id":"37276618500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960120","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Systolic arrays","MIMO","Lattices","Vectors","Hardware","Parallel processing","Detectors","Costs","Algorithm design and analysis","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","MIMO communication","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["systolic array","linear MIMO detection","all-swap lattice reduction algorithm","lattice-reduction-aided linear detection","MIMO receiver","LLL algorithm","bit-error-rate performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO receivers","systolic array","lattice reduction","wireless communications"]}],"abstract":"A systolic array to implement lattice-reduction-aided linear detection is proposed for a MIMO receiver.

Specifically, we consider the problem of selecting the linear precoder and the transmit and receive RF weights (or beamformers) for minimizing the bit error rate (BER) under the assumption of perfect channel knowledge and linear receivers. Firstly, it is shown that the optimal precoder amounts to uniformly distribute the overall mean square error (MSE) among the information symbols. Secondly, we propose a gradient search algorithm to obtain the optimal pair of beamformers. Interestingly, in the case of low signal to noise ratios (SNR), the proposed beamforming criterion is equivalent to the maximization of the received SNR. However, for moderate and high SNRs, part of the received SNR is sacrificed in order to improve the channel response of the worst subcarriers, which translates into significant advantages over other previously proposed approaches. Finally, the performance of the proposed scheme is illustrated by means of some numerical examples.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum BER beamforming in the RF domain for OFDM transmissions and linear receivers","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960133","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960133.pdf","startPage":"2513","endPage":"2516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960133","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960133/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Minimum BER beamforming in the RF domain for OFDM transmissions and linear receivers","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960133/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701535","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum BER beamforming in the RF domain for OFDM transmissions and linear receivers","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002513.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071624S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960133","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4960134,"authors":[{"name":"Hao He","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"He","id":"37309701000"},{"name":"Petre Stoica","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden"],"firstName":"Petre","lastName":"Stoica","id":"37277401700"},{"name":"Jian Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Li","id":"37279843500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960134","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960134","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Autocorrelation","Minimization methods","Sonar","Councils","Helium","Design engineering","Information technology","Clutter","Interference","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unimodular sequence design","good autocorrelation properties","integrated sidelobe level","cyclic algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Waveform design","unimodular sequences","integrated sidelobe level","merit factor","autocorrelation"]}],"abstract":"Unimodular (i.e., constant modulus) sequences with good autocorrelation properties are useful in several areas, including communications, radar and sonar.

Subspace-based tracking is normally considered for slow time-varying channels only.

After each update of the statistics, the subspace information is also updated using orthogonal iteration, and then a new channel estimate is computed. The proposed algorithm is verified in 3GPP-SCM suburban macro scenario, in which a mobile station is allowed to move in any direction with a constant speed of 100 km/h.

However, the reliability enhancements depend strongly on the accuracy of the carrier frequency offset (CFO) compensation and channel estimation algorithms. In this paper, we show that CFO compensation at relay is necessary in non-regenerative OFDM based wireless relay networks with relays employing space-time coding. A simple training scheme available for estimating space-time channel is exploited to estimate the CFO at the relay. Maximum likelihood (ML) and least squares (LS) based joint CFO and channel estimators are constructed for estimating the CFO and the product channel (effective channel from source to destination) at destination. For non-regenerative OFDM based wireless relays, we prove that the LS based estimator is equivalent to the ML based estimator. Theoretical mean square error for the product channel estimator is also derived.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960147.pdf","startPage":"2569","endPage":"2572","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint carrier frequency offset and channel estimation in OFDM based non-regenerative wireless relay networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Channel estimation","OFDM","Relays","Maximum likelihood estimation","Fading","Vectors","Intersymbol interference","Data communication","Maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","fading channels","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM modulation","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint carrier frequency offset","channel estimation","OFDM","non-regenerative wireless relay networks","cooperative relaying","combat wireless fading","reliability enhancements","space-time coding","maximum likelihood","least squares","mean square error","product channel estimator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carrier frequency offset","channel estimation","wireless relays","amplify and forward","Alamouti coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960147/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Joint carrier frequency offset and channel estimation in OFDM based non-regenerative wireless relay networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960147/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701549","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint carrier frequency offset and channel estimation in OFDM based non-regenerative wireless relay networks","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002569.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062542S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960147","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4960148,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan-Hwui Chung","affiliation":["Department of EE and Graduate Institute Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuan-Hwui","lastName":"Chung","id":"37405614900"},{"name":"Kai-Di Wu","affiliation":["Department of EE and Graduate Institute Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kai-Di Wu","id":"37633150100"},{"name":"See-May Phoong","affiliation":["Department of EE and Graduate Institute Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"See-May","lastName":"Phoong","id":"37266374400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960148","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Frequency estimation","Bit error rate","Frequency domain analysis","Maximum likelihood estimation","Erbium","Channel estimation","Costs","Energy consumption","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["I/Q imbalance joint estimation","channel response","OFDM systems","BER","bit error rate","carrier frequency offset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","I/Q","CFO","Channel estimation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study the joint estimation of I/Q imbalance, CFO and channel response for OFDM systems.

In this paper, we propose the multi-channel partial transmit sequences (MCPTS) method for multiple-access OFDM peak-to-average power ratio (PAR) reduction. By applying the PTS phase rotations to each access channel separately and assuming that the rotations can be detected by each user as a channel fading, MCPTS avoids two major disadvantages of standard PTS: i) the phase rotations can be detected without side information, and ii) the set of possible phase rotation values does not need to be finite. In addition, an iterative method of joint MCPTS and power allocation is proposed to minimize the average BER. The results show a significant BER improvement.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the PTS method and BER-minimizing power allocation of the multi-channeL OFDM system","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960151","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960151.pdf","startPage":"2585","endPage":"2588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960151","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960151/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"On the PTS method and BER-minimizing power allocation of the multi-channeL OFDM system","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960151/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701620","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the PTS method and BER-minimizing power allocation of the multi-channeL OFDM system","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002585.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039981S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960151","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4960152,"authors":[{"name":"Helge Luders","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Systems and Data Processing, RWTH Aachen University, Germany"],"firstName":"Helge","lastName":"Luders","id":"37269931200"},{"name":"Benedikt Eschbach","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Systems and Data Processing, RWTH Aachen University, Germany"],"firstName":"Benedikt","lastName":"Eschbach","id":"37645701200"},{"name":"Laurent Schmalen","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Systems and Data Processing, RWTH Aachen University, Germany"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Schmalen","id":"37397871100"},{"name":"Peter Vary","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Systems and Data Processing, RWTH Aachen University, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Vary","id":"37269677500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960152","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Constellation diagram","Iterative decoding","Bit error rate","Demodulation","Codecs","Frequency-selective fading channels","OFDM modulation","Signal mapping","Signal analysis","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combined source-channel coding","demodulation","error statistics","fading channels","iterative methods","modulation coding","OFDM modulation","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["turbo decodulation","exit optimized bit loading","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multiple turbo process","iterative demodulation","iterative source-channel decoding","correlated source codec parameters","wireless frequency-selective broadband fading channels","orthogonal flat-fading channels","modulation signal constellations","bit mapping rules","iterative reception","residual bit error rate","BER","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","OFDM-TDeC system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Turbo DeCodulation","Turbo Principle","BICM-ID","ISCD","OFDM"]}],"abstract":"We propose the combination of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and turbo decodulation (TDeC) - a multiple turbo process consisting of iterative demodulation and iterative source-channel decoding - for transmission of correlated source codec parameters over wireless frequency-selective broadband fading channels.

This technique along with erasure insertion is adequate when the the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) is moderate, around 0 dB, however, when the interference is severe, i.e. SIR = -20 dB, a non-orthogonal interference corrupts a large number of the data subcarriers due to spectral leakage. This situation requires a large number of erasures that compromise the code's error correction capability. The prediction-error filter (PEF) is proposed as an erasure insertion mechanism that localizes the erasures to the tones surrounding the interference, while not affecting the remaining tones.

Since the optimal solution to this problem is intractable, suboptimal closed-form solutions are proposed that optimize bounds on secrecy capacity for the case of a single eavesdropper, or that introduce additional constraints, such as nulling of signals at all eavesdroppers, for the case of multiple eavesdroppers.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960158","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960158.pdf","startPage":"2613","endPage":"2616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplify-and-forward based cooperation for secure wireless communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960158","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960158/","displayDocTitle":"Amplify-and-forward based cooperation for secure wireless communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701627","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960158/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplify-and-forward based cooperation for secure wireless communications","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002613.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055192S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960158","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4960161,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Fertl","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Radio-Frequency Engineering, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Fertl","id":"37294258000"},{"name":"Ari Hottinen","affiliation":["Nokia Group, Nokia Research Center, Finland"],"firstName":"Ari","lastName":"Hottinen","id":"37269045500"},{"name":"Gerald Matz","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Radio-Frequency Engineering, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Gerald","lastName":"Matz","id":"37284513500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960161","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Relays","Feedback","Fading","Gaussian noise","Intelligent networks","Radio frequency","Communication system control","Statistical distributions","Numerical simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","perturbation techniques","radio access networks","relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiplicative weight perturbation","1-bit feedback","distributed beamforming","wireless amplify-and-forward relay networks","sum power constraint","low complexity relay nodes","additive perturbation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["relay network","amplify-and-forward","distributed beamforming","Givens rotation","feedback"]}],"abstract":"This paper focuses on perturbation-based distributed beamforming with 1-bit feedback for wireless amplify-and-forward relay networks.

In multiuser systems where multiple sources may access the same set of relays simultaneously, CDMA spreading techniques along with multiuser detection schemes have been proposed in the literature to eliminate multiple access interference (MAI). In order for each relay to forward messages from all sources, a tremendous increase in dimensions (or spreading gain) is used to accommodate the relay transmissions. To reduce the required bandwidth or dimensions, we propose a reduced-rank multiuser relaying (RR-MUR) scheme where the data received from multiple users are first compressed into lower dimensions before being retransmitted. More specifically, linear compression precoders at the relays and decoder at the destination are found by imposing a recursive joint optimization procedure with the objective of minimizing the mean square error (MMSE) of the estimate at the destination. We show through numerical simulations that the RR-MUR scheme outperforms the often adopted Q-selection scheme in terms of increased spectral efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960162","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960162.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","startPage":"2629","endPage":"2632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced-rank multiuser relaying (RR-MUR) scheme for uplink CDMA networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960162","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-rank multiuser relaying (RR-MUR) scheme for uplink CDMA networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960162/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701631","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4960162/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-rank multiuser relaying (RR-MUR) scheme for uplink CDMA networks","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002629.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088092S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4960164,"authors":[{"name":"Chunguo Li","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Chunguo","lastName":"Li","id":"37536346900"},{"name":"Luxi Yang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Luxi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292054200"},{"name":"Wei-Ping Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Wei-Ping","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37275886700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960164","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system reliability","MIMO","Power system relaying","Relays","Channel capacity","Covariance matrix","Symmetric matrices","Cost function","Reliability theory","Information science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","channel capacity","convex programming","error statistics","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","radio links","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint optimal power allocation","MIMO system","radio link reliability","convex optimization criterion","error probability","cost function","relays","MSE","mean squared error method","channel capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","relay","power allocation","convex optimization"]}],"abstract":"A new optimization criterion is proposed to minimize error probability for the proposed joint optimal power allocation (PA) of the MIMO systems enhanced by relay in this paper.

We further illustrate that pairing of OFDM subcarriers will not provide performance gain when the aggregate power constraint is very large.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960168","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960168.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","startPage":"2653","endPage":"2656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single parameter optimization approach to the optimal power allocation of OFDM relaying system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960168","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Single parameter optimization approach to the optimal power allocation of OFDM relaying system","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960168/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701637","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4960168/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single parameter optimization approach to the optimal power allocation of OFDM relaying system","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002653.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035788S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960168","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4960171,"authors":[{"name":"Sander Wahls","affiliation":["Heinrich-Hertz-Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Mobilkommunikation, Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Sander","lastName":"Wahls","id":"37396572100"},{"name":"Holger Boche","affiliation":["Heinrich-Hertz-Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Mobilkommunikation, Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Holger","lastName":"Boche","id":"37276597900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960171","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","MIMO","Interchannel interference","Radiofrequency interference","Decision feedback equalizers","Finite impulse response filter","Interference constraints","Hydrogen","Transfer functions","Mean square error methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","decision feedback equalisers","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency selective MIMO channels","cochannel interference","decision feedback equalization","frequency selective multiple-input multiple-output channels","minimum mean square error method","zero forcing constraint","H2 optimal deconvolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO systems","Intersymbol interference","Cochannel interference","Equalizers","Deconvolution"]}],"abstract":"We consider realizable linear and decision feedback equalization (DFE) of frequency selective multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels in the presence of cochannel interference (CCI).

Assuming perfect channel state information at the receiver and spatial multiplexing at the transmitter with equal power allocation to the m dominant modes of the estimated channel, the pilot is designed to ensure an estimate of the channel which improves the forward link capacity. Using perturbation techniques, a lower bound on the forward link capacity is derived with respect to which the training sequence is optimized. Thus, the reverse channel training sequence makes use of the channel knowledge at the receiver. The performance of orthogonal training sequence with MMSE estimation at the transmitter and the proposed training sequence are compared.

But in practice, the knowledge of channel correlation function is not accurately available, thereby necessitating the need of an estimator that employs a fixed correlation function and is robust to mismatches with the actual one. While the maximally robust channel estimator for multi-carrier systems for the case of an infinite number of observations is well known for almost a decade, the one for the case of a finite number of observations has been only recently proposed. We extend the proposed maximally robust estimator to the practical case of small finite dimensional pilot grids by taking into account the grid edge effects. This paves the way for application of the estimator to practical systems such as 3G LTE. Simulation results for an LTE uplink system under different transmission scenarios demonstrate the superiority of the proposed maximally robust estimator over the heuristic one by as much as 1.35 dB in terms of the coded BER.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960176.pdf","endPage":"2688","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust 2-D channel estimation for multi-carrier systems with finite dimensional pilot grid","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960176","startPage":"2685","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960176","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Robust 2-D channel estimation for multi-carrier systems with finite dimensional pilot grid","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960176/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10701701","publicationDate":"April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4960176/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust 2-D channel estimation for multi-carrier systems with finite dimensional pilot grid","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002685.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047963S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4960178,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad A.

Sparse channel estimation refers to estimating the time domain channel impulse response by exploiting the fact that the channel has a very few nonzero taps.

Our previous work has shown an interesting identifiability result, that the whole time-domain channel can be uniquely identified by only having one subchannel to transmit pilots. However, this identifiability is in a probability-one sense, under some mild assumptions on the channel statistics. In this paper we establish a ldquoperfectrdquo channel identifiability (PCI) condition under which the channel is always uniquely identifiable. It is shown that PCI can be achieved by judiciously applying the so-called non-intersecting subspace OSTBCs. The resultant PCI achieving scheme has its number of pilots larger than that used in the previous probability-one identifiability achieving scheme, but smaller than that required in conventional pilot-aided channel estimation. Simulation results are presented to show that the proposed scheme can provide a better performance than the other schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960183","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960183.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","startPage":"2713","endPage":"2716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On perfect channel identifiability of semiblind ML detection of orthogonal space-time block coded OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960183","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On perfect channel identifiability of semiblind ML detection of orthogonal space-time block coded OFDM","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960183/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701708","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4960183/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On perfect channel identifiability of semiblind ML detection of orthogonal space-time block coded OFDM","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002713.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067437S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4960186,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A maximum likelihood decoder based on the sphere decoder has been used for efficient decoding of perfect STBCs. However the worst-case complexity for the sphere decoder is an exhaustive search. In this paper we present a reduced complexity algorithm for 3 times 3 perfect STBC which gives essentially maximum likelihood (ML) performance and which can be extended to other perfect STBC. The algorithm is based on the conditional maximization of the likelihood function with respect to one of the set of signal points given another. There are a number of choices for which signal points to condition on and the underlying structure of the code guarantees that one of the choices is good with high probability. Furthermore, the approach can be integrated with the sphere decoding algorithm with worst case complexity corresponding exactly to that of our algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960186","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960186.pdf","startPage":"2725","endPage":"2728","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity essentially maximum likelihood decoding of perfect space-time block codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960186","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960186/","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity essentially maximum likelihood decoding of perfect space-time block codes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701711","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960186/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity essentially maximum likelihood decoding of perfect space-time block codes","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002725.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043353S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-06"},{"_id":4960190,"authors":[{"name":"Emil Bjornson","affiliation":["ACCESS Linnaeus Center, Signal Processing Laboratory, Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden"],"firstName":"Emil","lastName":"Bjornson","id":"37322949300"},{"name":"Bjorn Ottersten","affiliation":["ACCESS Linnaeus Center, Signal Processing Laboratory, Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden"],"firstName":"Bjorn","lastName":"Ottersten","id":"37266309700"},{"name":"Eduard Jorswieck","affiliation":["Chair of Communication Theory, Communications Laboratory, Dresden University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Eduard","lastName":"Jorswieck","id":"37275005700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960190","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transmitters","Performance analysis","Block codes","Fading","Error analysis","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Throughput","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","block codes","correlation methods","error statistics","MIMO communication","multifrequency antennas","space division multiplexing","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO systems","space-time coding","spatially correlated multi antenna systems","precoder design","space-time block codes","spatial multiplexing","fading mitigation","symbol error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linear Precoding","Majorization","MIMO Systems","Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes","Symbol Error Rate"]}],"abstract":"The symbol error performance of spatially correlated multi-antenna systems is analyzed herein. When the transmitter only has statistical channel information, the use of space-time block codes still permits spatial multiplexing and mitigation of fading. The statistical information can be used for precoding to optimize some quality measure. Herein, we analyze the performance in terms of the symbol error rate (SER). It is shown analytically that spatial correlation at the receiver decreases the performance both without precoding and with an SER minimizing precoder. Without precoding, correlation should also be avoided at the transmitter side, but with an SER minimizing precoder the performance is actually improved by increasing spatial correlation at the transmitter. The structure of the optimized precoder is analyzed and the asymptotic properties at high and low SNRs are characterized and illustrated numerically.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960190","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960190.pdf","startPage":"2741","endPage":"2744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the impact of spatial correlation and precoder design on the performance of MIMO systems with space-time coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960190","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960190/","displayDocTitle":"On the impact of spatial correlation and precoder design on the performance of MIMO systems with space-time coding","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10700548","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960190/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the impact of spatial correlation and precoder design on the performance of MIMO systems with space-time coding","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002741.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069205S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960190","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4960191,"authors":[{"name":"Zia Muhammad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California Davis, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Zia","lastName":"Muhammad","id":"37645738100"},{"name":"Chen Meng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California Davis, Davis, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Chen Meng","id":"37087395608"},{"name":"Zhi Ding","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California Davis, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Ding","id":"37278651400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960191","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Block codes","MIMO","Blind equalizers","Linear programming","Maximum likelihood estimation","Channel estimation","Fading","Frequency estimation","Detectors","Student members"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind equalisers","block codes","channel coding","channel estimation","diversity reception","linear programming","MIMO communication","orthogonal codes","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind detection","generalized orthogonal space-time block code","blind equalization","linear programming","channel estimation","MIMO","diversity codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","space time block codes","linear programming","blind equalization","channel estimation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960191","abstract":"We present a new approach to blind equalization for generalized orthogonal space-time block codes.

Rayleigh fading channels under the QR-based successive detection framework. Instead of relying on BER under a fixed channel realization, the adopted design criterion is the mean BER (assuming there is no inter-layer error propagation) averaged with respect to the channel distribution. Such a design metric has two-fold advantages: (i) It is analytically tractable and is closely related to a block error probability upper bound when inter-layer error propagation occurs, and (ii) There is no need for repeated feedback of the instantaneous channel information. By exploiting a distinctive channel matrix structure unique to D-STTD systems we derive a closed-form approximate upper bound of the considered BER metric; through minimization of this bound an optimal power allocation scheme is obtained. Numerical simulation is used to illustrate the performance of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960192","startPage":"2749","endPage":"2752","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960192.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER improved transmit power allocation for D-STTD systems with QR-based successive symbol detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"BER improved transmit power allocation for D-STTD systems with QR-based successive symbol detection","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960192/","accessionNumber":"10700550","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960192/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER improved transmit power allocation for D-STTD systems with QR-based successive symbol detection","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002749.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045243S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960192","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4960204,"authors":[{"name":"Koji Harada","affiliation":["Agilent Technologies International Japan Limited, Kobe, Japan"],"lastName":"Koji Harada","id":"37631908900"},{"name":"Hideaki Sakai","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"lastName":"Hideaki Sakai","id":"37269995400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960204","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960204","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","covariance matrices","expectation-maximisation algorithm","FIR filters","Gaussian processes","principal component analysis","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind channel estimation","expectation-maximization algorithm","single-input multiple-output channel","finite-impulse-response channel","Gaussian process","output covariance matrix","probabilistic principle component analysis","PCA","filter subspace"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind channel estimation","subspace method","Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm","probabilistic principle component analysis (P-PCA)"]}],"abstract":"We propose an application of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to the problem of blind estimation of single-input multiple-output (SIMO), finite-impulse-response (FIR) channels. We first assume Gaussian input to formulate an EM-based estimation of the signal subspace of the output covariance matrix. This Gaussian assumption allows us to utilize knowledge from EM-based probabilistic principle component analysis (P-PCA). Next, we show that the equilibrium point of the EM iteration equations is reached without the Gaussian assumption, which suggests usage of non-Gaussian communication input signals. The estimated signal subspace is then utilized to identify the channels. In principle, the proposed method yields the same channel estimates as the widely-known subspace method, but is computationally more efficient. In addition, unlike typical EM applications, the proposed scheme is free from cumbersome parameter initialization issue, which greatly increases flexibility of the proposed scheme.","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960204.pdf","startPage":"2797","endPage":"2800","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960204","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind subspace-based channel estimation using the EM algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960204/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Blind subspace-based channel estimation using the EM algorithm","htmlLink":"/document/4960204/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10700562","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind subspace-based channel estimation using the EM algorithm","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002797.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080012S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960204","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4960207,"authors":[{"name":"Abdenour Labed","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, EMP, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Abdenour","lastName":"Labed","id":"38055798300"},{"name":"Abdeldjalil Aissa-El-Bey","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne de Bretagne, Brest, France","UMR CNRS 3192 Lab-STICC, Institut Telecom-Telecom Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Abdeldjalil","lastName":"Aissa-El-Bey","id":"38266471700"},{"name":"Thierry Chonavel","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne de Bretagne, Brest, France","UMR CNRS 3192 Lab-STICC, Institut Telecom-Telecom Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Thierry","lastName":"Chonavel","id":"38485391400"},{"name":"Adel Belouchrani","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, El Harrach, ENP, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Adel","lastName":"Belouchrani","id":"37284579700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960207","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":188},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive equalizers","Blind equalizers","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Constellation diagram","Polynomials","Telecommunications","Cost function","Gaussian processes","EMP radiation effects","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind equalisers","quadrature amplitude modulation","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QAM signals","hybrid adaptive blind equalization algorithms","constant modulus criterion","extended constant modulus criterion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive equalizers"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces new hybrid blind equalization algorithms for QAM signals, the first term of which is the constant modulus criterion (CMA) or its extended version (ECMA) and the second are a penalty term that vanishes at constellation points coordinates.

The signal-to-noise ratios of these subchannels are easily found, and, therefore, so are the subchannel bit allocations. In practice, perfect CSI is difficult to obtain. Imperfect CSI results in subchannel coupling and co-channel interference. In this paper, simple first-order expressions are presented for the signal and interference/noise powers for each subchannel for the imperfect CSI case. These expressions may be used to obtain more realistic subchannel bit allocations, allowing for fewer channel outages. Numerical simulations demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of the derived expressions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A MIMO channel perturbation analysis for robust bit loading","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960211","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960211.pdf","startPage":"2825","endPage":"2828","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960211","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960211/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A MIMO channel perturbation analysis for robust bit loading","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960211/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10700622","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A MIMO channel perturbation analysis for robust bit loading","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002825.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057382S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960211","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4960213,"authors":[{"name":"Zihuai Lin","affiliation":["University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia"],"lastName":"Zihuai Lin","id":"37291170400"},{"name":"Pei Xiao","affiliation":["Queen's University Belfast, UK"],"lastName":"Pei Xiao","id":"37268994500"},{"name":"Branka Vucetic","affiliation":["University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Branka","lastName":"Vucetic","id":"37278594000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960213","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1412},"abstract":"The LTE downlink multiuser multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems are analyzed in this paper.

We have recently extended these results to the case of linear receivers for frequency-selective MIMO channels. However, the diversity properties of linear receivers turn out to be fairly catastrophic. In this paper we show that full diversity can be restored by the introduction of a convolutive linear MIMO precoding scheme that we showed earlier to allow to attain the optimal DMT for ML or DFE detection (in the frequency-flat case). The precoder needs to be used with a moderate amount of redundancy in the form of zero-padding, and with a MMSE design for the linear equalizer. A MMSE-ZF design also benefits substantially from the precoding. The proposed scheme is a significant extension of an earlier SISO result by Tepelenlioglu to the MIMO case.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960215","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960215.pdf","startPage":"2841","endPage":"2844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear receivers for frequency-selective MIMO channels with redundant linear precoding can achieve full diversity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960215/","displayDocTitle":"Linear receivers for frequency-selective MIMO channels with redundant linear precoding can achieve full diversity","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10700626","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960215/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear receivers for frequency-selective MIMO channels with redundant linear precoding can achieve full diversity","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002841.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049191S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4960216,"authors":[{"name":"Noriyuki Takahashi","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Integrated Systems, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Noriyuki","lastName":"Takahashi","id":"37632271300"},{"name":"Isao Yamada","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Integrated Systems, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Isao","lastName":"Yamada","id":"37282458700"},{"name":"Ali H.

The significance of the results lies in the fact that making explicit use of block-sparsity can yield better reconstruction properties than treating the signal as being sparse in the conventional sense, thereby ignoring the additional structure in the problem.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960226","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960226.pdf","startPage":"2885","endPage":"2888","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block-sparsity: Coherence and efficient recovery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960226","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960226/","displayDocTitle":"Block-sparsity: Coherence and efficient recovery","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10700692","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960226/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block-sparsity: Coherence and efficient recovery","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002885.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051181S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4960228,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Global reliability is typically recovered by collecting all the measurements in a fusion center which takes proper decisions. However, centralized networks are more vulnerable and prone to congestion around the sink nodes. To relax the congestion problem, decrease the network vulnerability and improve the network efficiency, it is appropriate to bring the decisions at the lowest possible level. In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm allowing each node to improve the reliability of its own reading thanks to the interaction with the other nodes, assuming that the field monitored by the network is a smooth function. In mathematical terms, this only requires that the useful field belongs to a subspace of dimension smaller than the number of nodes. Although fully decentralized, the proposed algorithm is globally optimal, in the sense that it performs the projection of the overall set of observations onto the signal subspace through an iterative decentralized algorithms, that requires minimum convergence time, for any given node coverage.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed signal subspace projection algorithms with maximum convergence rate for sensor networks with topological constraints","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960228","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960228.pdf","startPage":"2893","endPage":"2896","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960228","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960228/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Distributed signal subspace projection algorithms with maximum convergence rate for sensor networks with topological constraints","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960228/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10700694","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed signal subspace projection algorithms with maximum convergence rate for sensor networks with topological constraints","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002893.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054867S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4960239,"authors":[{"name":"Yilun Chen","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Yilun","lastName":"Chen","id":"38185516700"},{"name":"Ami Wiesel","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Ami","lastName":"Wiesel","id":"37284056000"},{"name":"Alfred O.

The main impetus of this is that the radically dimension-lowering linear projection step can be done totally in analog hardware, in some cases even in constant time, to avoid the bottleneck in sensing and quantization steps where a large number of samples need to be sensed and quantized in short order, mandating the use of a large number of fast expensive sensors and A/D converters. Reconstruction algorithms from these projections have been found that come within distortion levels comparable to the state of the art in lossy compression algorithms. This paper considers a variation on compressed sensing that makes it resistant to spiky noise. This is achieved by an analog real-field error-correction coding step. It results in a small asymptotic overhead in the number of samples, but makes exact reconstruction under spiky measurement noise, one type of which is the salt and pepper noise in imaging devices, possible. Simulations are performed that corroborate our claim and in fact substantially improve reconstruction under unreliable sensing characteristics and are stable even under small perturbations with Gaussian noise.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960244","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960244.pdf","startPage":"2957","endPage":"2960","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inflating compressed samples: A joint source-channel coding approach for noise-resistant compressed sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960244","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960244/","displayDocTitle":"Inflating compressed samples: A joint source-channel coding approach for noise-resistant compressed sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10700767","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960244/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inflating compressed samples: A joint source-channel coding approach for noise-resistant compressed sensing","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0002957.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047835S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960244","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4960258,"authors":[{"name":"Namrata Vaswani","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Namrata","lastName":"Vaswani","id":"37270922700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960258","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":594},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960258","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Least squares methods","Kalman filters","Compressed sensing","Image reconstruction","Time measurement","Least squares approximation","Temperature sensors","Pattern analysis","Signal analysis","Nonlinear filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","Kalman filters","least squares approximations","reduced order systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kalman filtered compressed sensing","causal time sequence reconstruction","spatially sparse signals","slow time-varying sparsity pattern","linear incoherent measurements","reduced order KF","signal estimated nonzero coefficient set","Kalman filtering error","least squares estimation","genie-aided KF"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressed sensing","kalman filter","least squares"]}],"abstract":"In recent work, we studied the problem of causally reconstructing time sequences of spatially sparse signals, with unknown and slow time-varying sparsity patterns, from a limited number of linear ldquoincoherentrdquo measurements.

The key idea is to run a reduced order KF only for the current signal's estimated nonzero coefficients' set, while performing CS on the Kalman filtering error to estimate new additions, if any, to the set. KF may be replaced by least squares (LS) estimation and we call the resulting algorithm LS-CS. In this work, (a) we bound the error in performing CS on the LS error and (b) we obtain the conditions under which the KF-CS (or LS-CS) estimate converges to that of a genie-aided KF (or LS), i.e. the KF (or LS) which knows the true nonzero sets.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960258","startPage":"3013","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960258.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960258","endPage":"3016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analyzing Least Squares and Kalman Filtered Compressed Sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960258/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Analyzing Least Squares and Kalman Filtered Compressed Sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960258/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10700781","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing Least Squares and Kalman Filtered Compressed Sensing","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0003013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071004S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960258","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4960259,"authors":[{"name":"Yao Yu","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering Department, Drexel University, USA"],"lastName":"Yao Yu","id":"37405460000"},{"name":"Athina P.

This paper considers a distributed MIMO radar scenario, in which each transmit element is a node in a wireless network, and investigates the use of compressive sampling for direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. According to the theory of compressive sampling, a signal that is sparse in some domain can be recovered based on far fewer samples than required by the Nyquist sampling theorem. The DOA of targets form a sparse vector in the angle space, and therefore, compressive sampling can be applied for DOA estimation. The proposed approach achieves the superior resolution of MIMO radar with far fewer samples than other approaches. This is particularly useful in a distributed scenario, in which the results at each receive node need to be transmitted to a fusion center for further processing.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960259","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960259.pdf","startPage":"3017","endPage":"3020","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing for MIMO radar","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing for MIMO radar","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10700782","publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960259/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960259/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing for MIMO radar","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0003017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057407S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4960260,"authors":[{"name":"Mihailo Stojnic","affiliation":["Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Mihailo","lastName":"Stojnic","id":"37395583000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960260","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Compressed sensing","Sparse matrices","Equations","Probability distribution","Length measurement","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix algebra","signal processing","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","compressed sensing","under-determined systems","compressed measurement matrix","probability distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressed sensing","l1-optimization"]}],"abstract":"It is well known that compressed sensing problems reduce to solving large under-determined systems of equations.

The zero attractor promotes sparsity in taps during the filtering process, and therefore accelerates convergence when identifying sparse systems. We prove that the ZA-LMS can achieve lower mean square error than the standard LMS. To further improve the filtering performance, the RZA-LMS is developed using a reweighted zero attractor. The performance of the RZA-LMS is superior to that of the ZA-LMS numerically. Experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed filters in both convergence rate and steady-state behavior under sparsity assumptions on the true coefficient vector. The RZA-LMS is also shown to be robust when the number of non-zero taps increases.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960286","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960286.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","startPage":"3125","endPage":"3128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse LMS for system identification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960286","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sparse LMS for system identification","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960286/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10700918","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4960286/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse LMS for system identification","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0003125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057026S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960286","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4960290,"authors":[{"name":"Arvind Ganesh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Arvind","lastName":"Ganesh","id":"37540471000"},{"name":"Zihan Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"lastName":"Zihan Zhou","id":"37404365300"},{"name":"Yi Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"lastName":"Yi Ma","id":"37274225400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960290","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":289},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matching pursuit algorithms","Sufficient conditions","Sparks","Pursuit algorithms","Vectors","Dictionaries","Linear systems","Sparse matrices","Signal representations","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","signal processing","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subspace-sparse signal","sparse recovery algorithm","orthogonal matching pursuit","orthogonal basis pursuit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["subspace sparse","subspace incoherence","subspace matching pursuit","subspace base pursuit"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we show how two classical sparse recovery algorithms, orthogonal matching pursuit and basis pursuit, can be naturally extended to recover block-sparse solutions for subspace-sparse signals.

To cope with linearly growing complexity and memory requirements that batch Lasso estimators face when processing observations sequentially, the present paper develops a recursive Lasso algorithm that can also track slowly-varying sparse signals of interest. Performance analysis reveals that recursive Lasso can either estimate consistently the sparse signal's support or its nonzero entries, but not both. This motivates the development of a weighted version of the recursive Lasso scheme with weights obtained from the recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm. The resultant RLS-weighted Lasso algorithm provably estimates sparse signals consistently. Simulated tests compare competing alternatives and corroborate the performance of the novel algorithms in estimating time-invariant and tracking slow-varying signals under sparsity constraints.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960316","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960316.pdf","startPage":"3245","endPage":"3248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RLS-weighted Lasso for adaptive estimation of sparse signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960316","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960316/","displayDocTitle":"RLS-weighted Lasso for adaptive estimation of sparse signals","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701003","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960316/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RLS-weighted Lasso for adaptive estimation of sparse signals","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0003245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049469S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4960317,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Uhlich","affiliation":["Chair of System Theory and Signal Processing, Universit\u00e4t Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Uhlich","id":"37572669200"},{"name":"Bin Yang","affiliation":["Chair of System Theory and Signal Processing, Universit\u00e4t Stuttgart, Germany"],"lastName":"Bin Yang","id":"37317217900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960317","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960317","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Ellipsoids","Least squares approximation","Minimax techniques","Signal processing","Performance analysis","Parameter estimation","Constraint theory","Error analysis","Direction of arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","least squares approximations","mean square error methods","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear signal model","MMSE estimation","ellipsoidal constraints","Gaussian linear model","unknown parameter vector","mean squared error","constrained least squares","ordinary least squares","linear minimax approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Parameter estimation","Minimum mean squared error estimation","Restricted parameter space"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MMSE estimation in a linear signal model with ellipsoidal constraints","startPage":"3249","endPage":"3252","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960317.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960317","abstract":"The estimation of an unknown parameter vector in a Gaussian linear model is studied in this paper.

In particular, we show the equivalence of the MCRB for single carrier modulation and for multicarrier modulation. As a corollary, it is shown that multicarrier signals with uneven power distribution and/or non-contiguous frequency allocation bear a smaller MCRB than equally spaced and powered modulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960333.pdf","startPage":"3313","endPage":"3316","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new look into the issue of the Cram\u00e9r-Rao Bound for delay estimation of digitally modulated signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay estimation","Digital modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay estimation","modulation","signal processing","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay estimation","digitally modulated signal","modified Cramer-Rao bound","spectral property","single carrier modulation","multicarrier modulation","multicarrier signal","power distribution","noncontiguous frequency allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound","delay estimation","multicarrier"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960333/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A new look into the issue of the Cram\u00e9r-Rao Bound for delay estimation of digitally modulated signals","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960333/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701076","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new look into the issue of the Cram\u00e9r-Rao Bound for delay estimation of digitally modulated signals","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0003313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05003S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960333","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4960337,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Jacques Fuchs","affiliation":["IRISA/Universit\u00e9 de Rennes 1, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Jacques","lastName":"Fuchs","id":"37277690300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960337","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"abstract":"When seeking a sparse representation of a signal on a redundant basis, one replaces generally the quest for the true sparsest model by an lscr\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n minimization and solves thus a linear program.

In simulations, the PLS estimator is shown to improve the mean squared error performance by up to 30 percent versus the optimal linear estimator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960340/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4960340/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701137","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Jitter compensation in sampling via polynomial least squares estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Jitter compensation in sampling via polynomial least squares estimation","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0003341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051776S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4960342,"authors":[{"name":"Hojjat Akhondi Asl","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, UK"],"firstName":"Hojjat","lastName":"Akhondi Asl","id":"37085864986"},{"name":"Pier Luigi Dragotti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, UK"],"firstName":"Pier Luigi","lastName":"Dragotti","id":"37272505800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960342","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Kernel","Delay","Image reconstruction","Signal sampling","Filter bank","Multidimensional systems","Signal processing algorithms","Image sampling","Channel bank filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal sampling","splines (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single channel sampling","multichannel sampling","bilevel polygons","exponential splines","K-sided convex","K-sided bilevel polygon","E-spline filters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bilevel Polygon","Multichannel Sampling","Exponential Splines","FRI Signals","Projection-Slice Theorem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960342","abstract":"In this paper we present a novel approach for sampling and reconstructing any K-sided convex and bilevel polygon with the use of exponential splines [1].

The reconstructed signal satisfies a consistency condition: when passed through the same neuron, it triggers the same spike train as the original stimulus. The recovered stimulus has to also minimize a quadratic smoothness criterion. We show that under these conditions, the problem of recovery has a unique solution and provide an explicit reconstruction algorithm for stimuli encoded with a population of integrate-and-fire neurons. We demonstrate that the quality of reconstruction improves as the size of the population increases. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of our recovery method for an encoding circuit based on threshold spiking that arises in neuromorphic engineering.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Consistent recovery of stimuli encoded with a neural ensemble","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960379","endPage":"3500","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960379.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","startPage":"3497","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960379","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Encoding","Bandwidth","Sampling methods","Reconstruction algorithms","Neuromorphic engineering","Asynchronous circuits","Low pass filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","signal reconstruction","smoothing methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural ensemble","finite energy stimuli reconstruction","contiguous spikes","signal reconstruction","spike train","quadratic smoothness criterion","reconstruction algorithm","integrate-and-fire neurons","encoding circuit","threshold spiking","neuromorphic engineering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["time encoding","spiking neurons","consistent recovery"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Consistent recovery of stimuli encoded with a neural ensemble","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960379/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960379/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10701286","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consistent recovery of stimuli encoded with a neural ensemble","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0003497.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101325S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960379","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4960383,"authors":[{"name":"Divya Venkatraman","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Divya","lastName":"Venkatraman","id":"37645897300"},{"name":"Anamitra Makur","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Anamitra","lastName":"Makur","id":"37266951200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960383","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":534},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surveillance","Video coding","Video compression","Sparse matrices","Matching pursuit algorithms","Computer errors","Quantization","Bit rate","Signal processing","Reconstruction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","discrete cosine transforms","discrete wavelet transforms","object detection","video coding","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct compressive sensing approach","object-based surveillance video coding","residual object error","sparse signal","random measurement","transform-based compressive sensing approach","DCT","DWT"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Surveillance video","Object-based coding","Compressive sensing"]}],"abstract":"This paper studies the feasibility and investigates various choices in the application of compressive sensing (CS) to object-based surveillance video coding. The residual object error of a video frame is a sparse signal and CS, which aims to represent information of a sparse signal by random measurements, is considered for coding of object error. This work proposes several techniques using two approaches- direct CS and transform-based CS. The techniques are studied and analyzed by varying the different trade-off parameters such as the measurement index, quantization levels etc. Finally we recommend an optimal scheme for a range of bitrates.

For example, enhanced versions of root MUSIC and standard ESPRIT for non-circular sources as well as the entirely real-valued NC unitary ESPRIT algorithm have been proposed. We can achieve further enhancements in the R-dimensional (R-D) case by using tensor algebra to express and manipulate multidimensional signals in their natural R-D structure. This has led to tensor-based parameter estimation algorithms with enhanced estimation accuracy such as R-D unitary tensor- ESPRIT. In this paper we demonstrate how to achieve both benefits at the same time. This is not straightforward since the usual method to exploit non-circular sources destroys the tensor structure and therefore a new approach had to be found. This approach allows us to derive the NC R-D unitary tensor-ESPRIT algorithm which exploits the non-circularity of the sources and the R-D structure of the measured signals jointly. Numerical computer simulations demonstrate the benefit in terms of a significantly improved accuracy compared to state of the art algorithms.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960399","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and

Reference symbols (pilots) support coherent detection at the receiver and enable link adaptation at the transmitter, but add overhead and consume transmit power. As spatial transmit processing combined with multiple access essentially requires the provision of dedicated and common pilots, i.e. pilots that include respectively exclude user-specific transmit processing, the potential gains of MU-MIMO may partly be canceled by the incurred pilot overhead. Fortunately, spatial correlation at the transmitter has the potential to substantially reduce overheads, by introducing spatial reuse of dedicated pilots, and by utilizing spatial interpolation of common pilots. We demonstrate that a reduction in overhead is traded with compromised channel estimation accuracy, which particularly limits the attainable spectral efficiency in the high SNR regime. This implies that a bandwidth efficient pilot design is to be complemented by advanced channel estimation schemes, which enhance accuracy by utilizing data symbols together with pilots.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960410","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960410.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","startPage":"3621","endPage":"3624","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot design for multi-user MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960410","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pilot design for multi-user MIMO","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960410/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701463","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4960410/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot design for multi-user MIMO","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0003621.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069285S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960410","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4960415,"authors":[{"name":"Florian Roemer","affiliation":["Communications Research Laboratory, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Roemer","id":"37295437800"},{"name":"Martin Haardt","affiliation":["Communications Research Laboratory, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Haardt","id":"37285060400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960415","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":260},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Relays","Tensile stress","Channel state information","Computer simulation","Mobile communication","Communications technology","Signal processing algorithms","Iterative algorithms","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","tensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tensor-based channel estimation","TENCE","two-way relaying","multiple antennas","amplify-and-forward relays","data exchange","intermediate relay station","channel state information","relay amplification matrices","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Two-way Relaying","MIMO communication","Multidimensional signal processing","Channel estimation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we study two-way relaying with amplify-and-forward (AF) relays. In two-way relaying, two terminals exchange data with the help of an intermediate relay station. In order to enable mass deployment of these relays, we focus on very simple AF relays that do not have any channel state information. Hence, to separate the data streams in two-way relaying, both user terminals need reliable knowledge of all relevant channel parameters. We therefore propose the novel tensor-based channel estimation algorithm TENCE that provides both terminals with full knowledge of all channel parameters involved in the transmission. The solution is algebraic, i.e., it does not require any iterative procedures. Moreover, TENCE is applicable to arbitrary antenna configurations. We also derive criteria for the design of the pilot symbols and the corresponding relay amplification matrices. Computer simulations demonstrate the achievable channel estimation accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tensor-based channel estimation (TENCE) for two-way relaying with multiple antennas and spatial reuse","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960415","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960415.pdf","startPage":"3641","endPage":"3644","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960415","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960415/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Tensor-based channel estimation (TENCE) for two-way relaying with multiple antennas and spatial reuse","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960415/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701468","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tensor-based channel estimation (TENCE) for two-way relaying with multiple antennas and spatial reuse","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0003641.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049636S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4960427,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Signal transmission channels in rooms are modeled as auto-regressive systems in individual frequency bands. The proposed method adaptively estimates the regression coefficients of this model, which are called room regression coefficients (RRCs). The proposed method has two distinguishing features: (1) The method is based on the weighted recursive least squares algorithm, which enables an efficient RRC-estimate update as well as a fast convergence rate; (2) The method detects changes in speaker position and so can quickly catch up with the sudden channel changes that such position changes cause. Detection is realized by finding time frames where the power of dereverberated speech is anomalously amplified. Experimental results showed that the proposed method attained convergence in 5 seconds and successfully detected changes in speaker position.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960438","startPage":"3733","endPage":"3736","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960438.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive dereverberation of speech signals with speaker-position change detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960438/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive dereverberation of speech signals with speaker-position change detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960438/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10701563","publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive dereverberation of speech signals with speaker-position change detection","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0003733.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047488S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960438","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4960440,"authors":[{"name":"Emanuel A.

We build the Bayesian large margin HMMs (BLM-HMMs) and improve the model generalization for handling unknown test environments. Using BLM-HMMs, the variational Bayesian HMM parameters are estimated by maximizing lower bound of a marginal likelihood over the uncertainties of HMM parameters. The Bayesian large margin estimation is performed with frame selection mechanism, and is illustrated to meet the objective of support vector machines, i.e. maximal class margin and minimal training errors. The new objective function is not only interpreted as a discriminative criterion, but also feasible to deal with model selection and adaptive training. Experiments on phone recognition show that BLM-HMMs perform better than other generative and discriminative models.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960446","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960446.pdf","startPage":"3765","endPage":"3768","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian large margin hidden Markov models for speech recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960446","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960446/","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian large margin hidden Markov models for speech recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701639","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960446/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian large margin hidden Markov models for speech recognition","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0003765.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046085S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4960457,"authors":[{"name":"Guillermo Aradilla","affiliation":["Idiap Research Institute, Martigny, Switzerland","\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Guillermo","lastName":"Aradilla","id":"37645896800"},{"name":"Herve Bourlard","affiliation":["Idiap Research Institute, Martigny, Switzerland","\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Herve","lastName":"Bourlard","id":"37279207500"},{"name":"Mathew Magimai-Doss","affiliation":["Idiap Research Institute, Martigny, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Mathew","lastName":"Magimai-Doss","id":"38270198700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960457","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":152},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Vocabulary","Hidden Markov models","Spatial databases","Acoustic testing","Decoding","Acoustic applications","Automatic speech recognition","Acoustic measurements","Parametric statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","information theory","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["posterior features","speech recognition","user-defined vocabulary","template matching framework","phoneme posterior probabilities","information theoretic dissimilarity measures"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speech recognition","template matching","posterior features","Kullback-Leibler divergence"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Posterior features applied to speech recognition tasks with user-defined vocabulary","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960457","startPage":"3809","endPage":"3812","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960457.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960457","abstract":"This paper presents a novel approach for those applications where vocabulary is defined by a set of acoustic samples. In this approach, the acoustic samples are used as reference templates in a template matching framework. The features used to describe the reference templates and the test utterances are estimates of phoneme posterior probabilities. These posteriors are obtained from a MLP trained on an auxiliary database. Thus, the speech variability present in the features is reduced by applying the speech knowledge captured by the MLP on the auxiliary database. Moreover, information theoretic dissimilarity measures can be used as local distances between features. When compared to state-of-the-art systems, this approach outperforms acoustic-based techniques and obtains comparable results to orthography-based methods. The proposed method can also be directly combined with other posterior-based HMM systems. This combination successfully exploits the complementarity between templates and parametric models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960457/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10701650","publicationDate":"April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4960457/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Posterior features applied to speech recognition tasks with user-defined vocabulary","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Posterior features applied to speech recognition tasks with user-defined vocabulary","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0003809.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050511S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4960461,"authors":[{"name":"Ozlem Kalinli","affiliation":["Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Ozlem","lastName":"Kalinli","id":"37318540100"},{"name":"Michael L.

In this paper, we propose a noise adaptive training (NAT) algorithm that can be applied to all training data that normalizes the environmental distortion as part of the model training. In contrast to the feature enhancement methods, NAT estimates the underlying ldquopseudo-cleanrdquo model parameters directly without relying on point estimates of the clean speech features as an intermediate step. The pseudo-clean model parameters learned with NAT are later used with vector Taylor series (VTS) model adaptation for decoding noisy utterances at test time.

The goal of this study is to build the regularized CDHMMs to improve model generalization, and achieve desirable recognition performance for unknown test speech. Under this framework, we develop an EM iterative procedure to estimate the marginal distribution or the evidence function for exponential family distributions. By adopting the variational Bayesian inference, we derive an empirical Bayesian solution to CDHMM parameters and their hyperparameters. Such a regularized CDHMM compensates the model uncertainty and the ill-posed conditions. Compared with maximum likelihood (ML) or other Bayesian approaches with heuristic hyperparameters, the proposed approach can utilize available data more effectively. The experiments on noisy speech recognition using Aurora2 show that the proposed Bayesian approach performs better than the baseline ML CDHMMs especially with mismatched test data or limited training data.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960469","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960469.pdf","startPage":"3857","endPage":"3860","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An evidence framework for Bayesian learning of continuous-density hidden Markov models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960469","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960469/","displayDocTitle":"An evidence framework for Bayesian learning of continuous-density hidden Markov models","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701717","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960469/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An evidence framework for Bayesian learning of continuous-density hidden Markov models","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0003857.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051357S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960469","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4960470,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The flat model allows us to model arbitrary attributes and dependences of the output. This is different from the HMMs typically used for speech recognition. This conventional modeling approach is based on sequential data and makes rigid assumptions on the dependences. HMMs have proven to be convenient and appropriate for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition. Our task under consideration, however, is the Windows Live Search for Mobile (WLS4M) task. This is a cellphone application that allows users to interact with web-based information portals. In particular, the set of valid outputs can be considered discrete and finite (although probably large, i.e., unseen events are an issue). Hence, a flat direct model lends itself to this task, making the adding of different knowledge sources and dependences straightforward and cheap. Using e.g. HMM posterior, m-gram, and spotter features, significant improvements over the conventional HMM system were observed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A flat direct model for speech recognition","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960470","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960470.pdf","startPage":"3861","endPage":"3864","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960470","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960470/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A flat direct model for speech recognition","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960470/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701718","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A flat direct model for speech recognition","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0003861.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056541S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960470","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4960478,"authors":[{"name":"Srinivas Desai","affiliation":["International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Srinivas","lastName":"Desai","id":"37403561000"},{"name":"E.

A multi-style discriminative training with minimum phone error (MPE) criterion is further applied to the compensated features and obtains significant performance improvement on real-world noisy test sets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960488/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10700569","htmlLink":"/document/4960488/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Stereo-based stochastic mapping with discriminative training for noise robust speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stereo-based stochastic mapping with discriminative training for noise robust speech recognition","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0003933.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088011S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4960492,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Wollmer","affiliation":["Institute of Human-Machine Communication, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Wollmer","id":"37542055400"},{"name":"Florian Eyben","affiliation":["Institute of Human-Machine Communication, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Eyben","id":"37542054600"},{"name":"Joseph Keshet","affiliation":["Idiap Research Institute, Martigny, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Keshet","id":"37645804600"},{"name":"Alex Graves","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science VI, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Graves","id":"37549130400"},{"name":"Bjorn Schuller","affiliation":["Institute of Human-Machine Communication, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Bjorn","lastName":"Schuller","id":"37283946000"},{"name":"Gerhard Rigoll","affiliation":["Institute of Human-Machine Communication, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Rigoll","id":"37270642400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960492","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":482},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust discriminative keyword spotting for emotionally colored spontaneous speech using bidirectional LSTM networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960492.pdf","startPage":"3949","endPage":"3952","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960492","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960492","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Hidden Markov models","Recurrent neural networks","Context","Speech enhancement","Spatial databases","Speech recognition","Man machine systems","Computer science","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","hidden Markov models","speech coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bidirectional long short-term memory recurrent neural nets","speech decoding","hidden Markov model","abstract vector space","HUMAINE sensitive artificial listener database","robust discriminative keyword spotting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speech recognition","Robustness","Recurrent neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960492","abstract":"In this paper we propose a new technique for robust keyword spotting that uses bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) recurrent neural nets to incorporate contextual information in speech decoding. Our approach overcomes the drawbacks of generative HMM modeling by applying a discriminative learning procedure that non-linearly maps speech features into an abstract vector space. By incorporating the outputs of a BLSTM network into the speech features, it is able to make use of past and future context for phoneme predictions. The robustness of the approach is evaluated on a keyword spotting task using the HUMAINE sensitive artificial listener (SAL) database, which contains accented, spontaneous, and emotionally colored speech. The test is particularly stringent because the system is not trained on the SAL database, but only on the TIMIT corpus of read speech. We show that our method prevails over a discriminative keyword spotter without BLSTM-enhanced feature functions, which in turn has been proven to outperform HMM-based techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960492/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10700573","htmlLink":"/document/4960492/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robust discriminative keyword spotting for emotionally colored spontaneous speech using bidirectional LSTM networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust discriminative keyword spotting for emotionally colored spontaneous speech using bidirectional LSTM networks","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0003949.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085237S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960492","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4960493,"authors":[{"name":"Ariya Rastrow","affiliation":["Center of Language and Speech Processing, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Ariya","lastName":"Rastrow","id":"37645703400"},{"name":"Abhinav Sethy","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

The voice source is a signal that is estimated by inverse-filtering speech signals with an estimate of the vocal tract filter. It is used in speech analysis, synthesis, recognition and coding to decompose a speech signal into its source and vocal tract filter components. Existing approaches parameterize the voice source signal with physically- or mathematically-motivated models. Though the models are well-defined, estimation of their parameters is not well understood and few are capable of reproducing the large variety of voice source waveforms. Here we present a data-driven approach to classify types of voice source waveforms based upon their mel frequency cepstrum coefficients with Gaussian mixture modelling. A set of ldquoprototyperdquo waveform classes is derived from a weighted average of voice source cycles from real data. An unknown speech signal is then decomposed into its prototype components and resynthesized. Results indicate that with sixteen voice source classes, low resynthesis errors can be achieved.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960496","startPage":"3965","endPage":"3968","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960496.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-driven voice soruce waveform modelling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Data-driven voice soruce waveform modelling","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960496/","accessionNumber":"10700577","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960496/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-driven voice soruce waveform modelling","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0003965.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078404S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960496","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4960515,"authors":[{"name":"Mitchell McLaren","affiliation":["Speech and Audio Research Laboratory, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Mitchell","lastName":"McLaren","id":"37547737300"},{"name":"Brendan Baker","affiliation":["Speech and Audio Research Laboratory, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Brendan","lastName":"Baker","id":"37529815000"},{"name":"Robbie Vogt","affiliation":["Speech and Audio Research Laboratory, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Robbie","lastName":"Vogt","id":"37534496600"},{"name":"Sridha Sridharan","affiliation":["Speech and Audio Research Laboratory, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Sridha","lastName":"Sridharan","id":"37266096100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960515","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"abstract":"The problem of background dataset selection in SVM-based speaker verification is addressed through the proposal of a new data-driven selection technique.

We explore a signal dependent unknown linear transform, namely the impulse response matrix operating on a sparse excitation, as in the linear model of speech production, for recovering compressive sensed speech. Since the linear transform is signal dependent and unknown, unlike the standard CS formulation, a codebook of transfer functions is proposed in a matching pursuit (MP) framework for CS recovery. It is found that MP is efficient and effective to recover CS encoded speech as well as jointly estimate the linear model. Moderate number of CS measurements and low order sparsity estimate will result in MP converge to the same linear transform as direct VQ of the LP vector derived from the original signal. There is also high positive correlation between signal domain approximation and CS measurement domain approximation for a large variety of speech spectra.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE

bilingual automatic speech recognition techniques under the constraint that only the acoustic model (AM) of the native language is used at runtime. The first three techniques fall into the category of lexicon conversion where each phoneme sequence (PHS) in the foreign language (FL) lexicon is mapped into the native language (NL) phoneme sequence. The first technique determines the PHS mapping through the international phonetic alphabet (IPA) features; The second and third techniques are data-driven. They determine the mapping by converting the PHS into corresponding context-independent and context-dependent hidden Markov models (HMMs) respectively and searching for the NL PHS with the least Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between the HMMs. The fourth technique falls into the category of AM merging where the FL's AM is merged into the NL's AM by mapping each senone in the FL's AM to the senone in the NL's AM with the minimum KLD. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each technique developed, report empirical evaluation results on recognizing English utterances with a Korean recognizer, and demonstrate the high correlation between the average KLD and the word error rate (WER). The results show that the AM merging technique performs the best, achieving 60% relative WER reduction over the IPA-based technique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960553/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10700800","htmlLink":"/document/4960553/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cross-lingual speech recognition under runtime resource constraints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-lingual speech recognition under runtime resource constraints","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0004193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035546S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960553","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4960579,"authors":[{"name":"Scott Novotney","affiliation":["BBN Technologies, GTE, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Novotney","id":"37646621800"},{"name":"Richard Schwartz","affiliation":["BBN Technologies, GTE, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Schwartz","id":"37284932800"},{"name":"Jeff Ma","affiliation":["BBN Technologies, GTE, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Jeff","lastName":"Ma","id":"37281071900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960579","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":203},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised acoustic and language model training with small amounts of labelled data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960579","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Natural languages","Training data","Telephony","Speech recognition","Decoding","Acoustic measurements","Robustness","Vocabulary","Labeling","Terminology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","estimation theory","natural language processing","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsupervised acoustic model training","language model training","word confidence estimation","n-gram count"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Unsupervised Training","Word Confidence","Conversational Telephone Speech","Language Modeling"]}],"abstract":"We measure the effects of a weak language model, estimated from as little as 100k words of text, on unsupervised acoustic model training and then explore the best method of using word confidences to estimate n-gram counts for unsupervised language model training.

However, the question of whether it is better to use a word-based or a character-based model warrants being for the Mandarin Chinese language. Since Chinese is written without any spaces or word delimiters, a word segmentation algorithm is applied in a pre-processing step prior to training a word-based language model. Chinese characters carry meaning and speakers are free to combine characters to construct new words. This suggests that character information can also be useful in communication. This paper explores both word-based and character-based models, and their complementarity. Although word-based modeling is found to outperform character-based modeling, increasing the vocabulary size from 56 k to 160 k words did not lead to a gain in performance. Results are reported for the Gale Mandarin speech-to-text task.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960586","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960586.pdf","startPage":"4325","endPage":"4328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling characters versuswords for mandarin speech recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960586","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960586/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling characters versuswords for mandarin speech recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10700944","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960586/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling characters versuswords for mandarin speech recognition","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0004325.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051928S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4960588,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Lin","affiliation":["University of Washington, USA"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Lin","id":"37422013400"},{"name":"Li Deng","affiliation":["Microsoft Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Deng","id":"37271500200"},{"name":"Dong Yu","affiliation":["Microsoft Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Yu","id":"37419739100"},{"name":"Yi-fan Gong","affiliation":["Microsoft Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Yi-fan","lastName":"Gong","id":"37271888900"},{"name":"Alex Acero","affiliation":["Microsoft Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Acero","id":"37284200500"},{"name":"Chin-Hui Lee","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Chin-Hui","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280405600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960588","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":420},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vocabulary","Automatic speech recognition","Natural languages","Uninterruptible power systems","Context modeling","Speech recognition","Adaptation model","Training data","Impurities","Large-scale systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational linguistics","speech recognition","vocabulary"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilingual acoustic modeling","large vocabulary ASR","automatic speech recognition","universal phone model","language-universal acoustic model","language-adaptive acoustic model","language-specific model","acoustic-phonetic property","cross-lingual speech recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multilingualism","acoustic modeling","language adaptation","universal phone models"]}],"abstract":"We study key issues related to multilingual acoustic modeling for automatic speech recognition (ASR) through a series of large-scale ASR experiments.

Language-universal and language-adaptive models are compared with language-specific models, and the comparison results show that in many cases it is possible to build general-purpose language-universal and language-adaptive acoustic models that outperform language-specific ones if the set of shared units, the structure of shared states, and the shared acoustic-phonetic properties among different languages can be properly utilized.

The proposed algorithm is based upon a recursive refinement process in which each step of the algorithm expectation of the instantaneous noise power is calculated based on information from the incoming signal and the current estimated distribution parameters, and estimation of the distribution parameter is refined accordingly to incorporate the expectation results. A bias estimation correction method is also introduced in the algorithm to avoid estimation errors that may occur when there is a significant mismatch between the statistics of the input signal and the current estimated distribution parameters.

This paper is aimed to automatically evaluate the sound quality of various types of noise reduction methods using kurtosis change ratio.

All the lines chaining maxima of a wavelet transform across scales are built. Then a back-tracking procedure allows for selection of the optimal line for each pitch period, the top of which indicates the GCI. The LOMA method is then evaluated by comparing its results to the DYPSA (Naylor & al.) algorithm, with the option of using inverse filtering as preprocessing.

One of the advantage of the LOMA method is its ability to deal with variations in the glottal source parameters.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Linear predictive coding","Speech analysis","Filtering algorithms","Speech processing","Speech synthesis","Frequency synthesizers","Nonlinear filters","Delay","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal detection","speech processing","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Glottal closure instant detection","lines-of-maximum amplitude","wavelet transform modulus maxima","singularity detection","back-tracking procedure","speech processing","pitch period"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wavelet","GCI","EGG","Pitch Marks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960634","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960634.pdf","startPage":"4517","endPage":"4520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Glottal closure instant detection using Lines of Maximum Amplitudes (LOMA) of thewavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Glottal closure instant detection using Lines of Maximum Amplitudes (LOMA) of thewavelet transform","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960634/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960634/","accessionNumber":"10701158","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Glottal closure instant detection using Lines of Maximum Amplitudes (LOMA) of thewavelet transform","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0004517.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045987S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4960653,"authors":[{"name":"Heidi Christensen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Heidi","lastName":"Christensen","id":"37281308300"},{"name":"Ning Ma","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Ma","id":"37629396000"},{"name":"Stuart N.

We present a binaural system for localising simultaneous speakers which exploits the fact that in a speech mixture there exist spectro-temporal regions or dasiafragmentspsila, where the energy is dominated by just one of the speakers. A fragment-level localisation model is proposed that integrates the localisation cues within a fragment using a weighted mean. The weights are based on local estimates of the degree of reverberation in a given spectro-temporal cell. The paper investigates different weight estimation approaches based variously on, i) an established model of the perceptual precedence effect; ii) a measure of interaural coherence between the left and right ear signals; iii) a data-driven approach trained in matched acoustic conditions. Experiments with reverberant binaural data with two simultaneous speakers show appropriate weighting can improve frame-based localisation performance by up to 24%.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960653","startPage":"4593","endPage":"4596","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04960653.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A speech fragment approach to localising multiple speakers in reverberant environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960653/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A speech fragment approach to localising multiple speakers in reverberant environments","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4960653/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10701233","publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A speech fragment approach to localising multiple speakers in reverberant environments","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0004593.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065761S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4960653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4960661,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Shao","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Shao","id":"37554880600"},{"name":"Zhaozhang Jin","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Zhaozhang","lastName":"Jin","id":"37633143100"},{"name":"DeLiang Wang","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"DeLiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37077285500"},{"name":"Soundararajan Srinivasan","affiliation":["Research and Technology Center, Robert Bosch Limited Liability Company, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Soundararajan","lastName":"Srinivasan","id":"37418129200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4960661","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":682},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Noise robustness","Speech enhancement","Automatic speech recognition","Cepstral analysis","Humans","Acoustic noise","Frequency","Filter bank","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cepstral analysis","feature extraction","filtering theory","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["auditory-based feature","speech recognition","auditory periphery model","gammatone frequency cepstral coefficient","cepstral analysis","gammatone filterbank response","acoustic feature","computational auditory scene analysis system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Robust speech recognition","auditory feature","gammatone frequency cepstral coefficients","computational auditory scene analysis"]}],"abstract":"A conventional automatic speech recognizer does not perform well in the presence of noise, while human listeners are able to segregate and recognize speech in noisy conditions.

Due to programmable feature of FPGAs, faults of FPGAs can be easily tolerated if fault sites can be located. A hardware/software (HW/SW) co- verification technique for FPGA test is proposed and presented in the paper. Taking advantage of flexibility and observability of software in conjunction with high-speed simulation of hardware, this technique is capable of testing each input/output block (IOB) and configurable logic block (CLB) of FPGA automatically, exhaustively and repeatedly. Fault cells of FPGA can be positioned automatically by the proposed approach. As a result, test efficiency and reliability can be enhanced without manual work.","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Circuits and Systems International Conference on Testing and Diagnosis","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Circuits and Systems International Conference on Testing and Diagnosis","pdfPath":"/iel5/4960731/4960732/04960748.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A HW/SW Co-Verification Technique for Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) Test","doi":"10.1109/CAS-ICTD.2009.4960748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4960732","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAS-ICTD.2009.4960748","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960748","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4960748/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A HW/SW Co-Verification Technique for Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) Test","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10665685","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-29 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4960748/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A HW/SW Co-Verification Technique for Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) Test","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"03-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042049S","chronDate":"28-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4960731","isNumber":"4960732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4960731","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4960732","articleId":"4960748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4960751,"authors":[{"name":"Hsin-Wen Ting","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsin-Wen","lastName":"Ting","id":"37267298700"},{"name":"I-Jen Chao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"I-Jen","lastName":"Chao","id":"37543531700"},{"name":"Yu-Chang Lien","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Chang","lastName":"Lien","id":"37584540000"},{"name":"Soon-Jyh Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Soon-Jyh","lastName":"Chang","id":"37281064400"},{"name":"Bin-Da Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Bin-Da","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279239600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2587-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-8475"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-8491"}],"articleNumber":"4960751","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":226},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit analysis","Built-in self-test","Histograms","Circuit testing","Costs","Parameter estimation","Accuracy","Circuit synthesis","Fast Fourier transforms","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","built-in self test","fast Fourier transforms","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-cost ADC output response analyzer circuit","BIST application","built-in self-test","sine-wave histogram testing method","coordinate rotation digital computer technique","CORDIC","fast Fourier transform","circuit design","size 0.18 mum","word length 8 bit"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4960751","abstract":"In this paper, a low-cost ADC output response analyzer (ORA) circuit for built-in self-test (BIST) application is proposed.

The issue had been deeply studied.

The described method uses fault-wise table and multi-objective genetic algorithm to find the optimal set of test points. First, the fault-wise table is constructed whose entries are measurements associated with faults and test points. The problem of optimal test points selection is transformed to the selection of the columns that isolate the rows of the table. Then, four objectives are described according to practical test requirements. The multi-objective genetic algorithm is explained. Finally, the presented approach is illustrated by a practical example.

In the selfish approach, each peer would like to exploit the full capacity of his access link only for his downloads. However, if all peers acted selfishly, the system would collapse. In order to motivate peers to cooperate, we propose a distributed reputation-based system according to which peers earn reputation analogous to their contributions. In this way, each peer has to trade off the capacity he will dedicate for uploading in order to increase his reputation and therefore his revenue and the capacity he will dedicate for his downloads. All peers act rationally, trying to maximize their utility. Our proposed policies lead rational peers to cooperation while promoting fairness, as peers receive resources in proportion to their contributions. Our policies outperform existing work in this area in which the slowest link becomes the bottleneck of a heterogeneous system of different link capacity peers. On the contrary, no such bottleneck appears when our policies are used, improving the performance of the system. Finally, we apply our reputation-based approach in a BitTorrent-like file sharing system and we highlight the potential performance gains.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reputation-Based Resource Allocation in P2P Systems of Rational Users","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2009.80","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/5420346/04967576.pdf","startPage":"466","endPage":"479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2009.80","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5420346","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4967576","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4967576/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"Reputation-Based Resource Allocation in P2P Systems of Rational Users","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4967576/","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11151924","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reputation-Based Resource Allocation in P2P Systems of Rational Users","sourcePdf":"ttd2010040466.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085135S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"5420346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5420346","articleId":"4967576","onlineDate":"26 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4967578,"authors":[{"name":"Yaniv Frishman","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2945/5165577/4967578/4967578-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yaniv Frishman received the BSc degree (summa cum laude) in computer engineering and the Master's degree from the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel, in 1997 and 2006, respectively, and the PhD degree from the Department of Computer Science of the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, in 2009.

In this paper, we propose a technique for modifying an existing layout in order to reduce the clutter in dense areas. A physically inspired evolution process based on a modified heat equation is used to create an improved layout density image, making better use of available screen space. Using results from optimal mass transport problems, a warp to the improved density image is computed. The graph nodes are displaced according to the warp. The warp maintains the overall structure of the graph, thus limiting disturbances to the mental map, while reducing the clutter in dense areas of the layout. The complexity of the algorithm depends mainly on the resolution of the image visualizing the graph and is linear in the size of the graph. This allows scaling the computation according to required running times. It is demonstrated how the algorithm can be significantly accelerated using a graphics processing unit (GPU), resulting in the ability to handle large graphs in a matter of seconds. Results on several layout algorithms and applications are demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2009.55","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5165577/04967578.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165577","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.55","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","startPage":"777","endPage":"788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uncluttering Graph Layouts Using Anisotropic Diffusion and Mass Transport","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4967578","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Uncluttering Graph Layouts Using Anisotropic Diffusion and Mass Transport","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4967578/","volume":"15","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4967578/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10780753","pubMedId":"19590104","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uncluttering Graph Layouts Using Anisotropic Diffusion and Mass Transport","sourcePdf":"ttg2009050777.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08485S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5165577","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5165577","articleId":"4967578","onlineDate":"26 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4967588,"authors":[{"name":"Si Si","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/5470218/4967588/4967588-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Si Si received the BEng degree from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2008.

In this paper, we present a family of subspace learning algorithms based on a new form of regularization, which transfers the knowledge gained in training samples to testing samples. In particular, the new regularization minimizes the Bregman divergence between the distribution of training samples and that of testing samples in the selected subspace, so it boosts the performance when training and testing samples are not independent and identically distributed. To test the effectiveness of the proposed regularization, we introduce it to popular subspace learning algorithms, e.g., principal components analysis (PCA) for cross-domain face modeling; and Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FLDA), locality preserving projections (LPP), marginal Fisher's analysis (MFA), and discriminative locality alignment (DLA) for cross-domain face recognition and text categorization. Finally, we present experimental evidence on both face image data sets and text data sets, suggesting that the proposed Bregman divergence-based regularization is effective to deal with cross-domain learning problems.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2009.126","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/5470218/04967588.pdf","startPage":"929","endPage":"942","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5470218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2009.126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bregman Divergence-Based Regularization for Transfer Subspace Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4967588","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","displayDocTitle":"Bregman Divergence-Based Regularization for Transfer Subspace Learning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4967588/","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 May 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11341015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4967588/","volume":"22","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bregman Divergence-Based Regularization for Transfer Subspace Learning","sourcePdf":"ttk2010070929.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.216419S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"5470218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"282","xplore-issue":"5470218","articleId":"4967588","onlineDate":"26 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":4967591,"authors":[{"name":"Senhua Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/5291226/4967591/4967591-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Senhua Huang received the BS and master of engineering degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2003 and 2006, respectively.

It enables secondary users (SUs) to opportunistically access low-occupancy primary spectral bands as long as their negative effect on the primary user (PU) access is constrained. This PU protection requirement is particularly challenging for multiple SUs over a wide geographical area. In this paper, we study the fundamental performance limit on the throughput of cognitive radio networks under the PU packet collision constraint. With perfect sensing, we develop an optimum spectrum access strategy under generic PU traffic patterns. Without perfect sensing, we quantify the impact of missed detection and false alarm, and propose a modified threshold-based spectrum access strategy that achieves close-to-optimal performance. Moreover, we develop and evaluate a distributed access scheme that enables multiple SUs to collectively protect the PU while adapting to behavioral changes in PU usage patterns. Our results provide useful insight on the trade-off between the protection of the primary user and the throughput performance of cognitive radios.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Transmission Strategies for Dynamic Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radio Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2009.84","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/5291226/04967591.pdf","startPage":"1636","endPage":"1648","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2009.84","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5291226","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4967591","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4967591/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Transmission Strategies for Dynamic Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radio Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4967591/","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10940665","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Transmission Strategies for Dynamic Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2009121636.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073491S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5291226","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"5291226","articleId":"4967591","onlineDate":"26 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4967595,"authors":[{"name":"Neal Patwari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake, UT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/5340423/4967595/4967595-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Neal Patwari received the BS (1997) and MS (1999) degrees in electrical engineering from Virginia Tech, and the PhD degree in electrical engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (2005).

This paper addresses bit extraction, i.e., the extraction of secret key bits from noisy radio channel measurements at two nodes such that the two secret keys reliably agree. Problems include 1) nonsimultaneous directional measurements, 2) correlated bit streams, and 3) low bit rate of secret key generation. This paper introduces high-rate uncorrelated bit extraction (HRUBE), a framework for interpolating, transforming for decorrelation, and encoding channel measurements using a multibit adaptive quantization scheme which allows multiple bits per component. We present an analysis of the probability of bit disagreement in generated secret keys, and we use experimental data to demonstrate the HRUBE scheme and to quantify its experimental performance. As two examples, the implemented HRUBE system can achieve 22 bits per second at a bit disagreement rate of 2.2 percent, or 10 bits per second at a bit disagreement rate of 0.54 percent.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4967595/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","volume":"9","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10995276","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/4967595/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"High-Rate Uncorrelated Bit Extraction for Shared Secret Key Generation from Channel Measurements","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Rate Uncorrelated Bit Extraction for Shared Secret Key Generation from Channel Measurements","sourcePdf":"ttm2010010017.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111312S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5340423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"239","xplore-issue":"5340423","articleId":"4967595","onlineDate":"26 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4967596,"authors":[{"name":"Vinod Namboodiri","affiliation":["Wichita State University, Wichita, KS, US"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/5340423/4967596/4967596-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vinod Namboodiri received the PhD degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst in 2008.

We further develop an analytical framework to predict the performance of our protocols and enable protocol parameter selection. We demonstrate that all three protocols provide significant energy savings both at the reader and tags (if they are active tags) compared to the existing Query Tree protocol, while sharing the deterministic property of the latter. Further, we show that our protocols provide similar benefits even with correlated tag IDs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Aware Tag Anticollision Protocols for RFID Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2009.96","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/5340423/04967596.pdf","startPage":"44","endPage":"59","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2009.96","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340423","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4967596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4967596/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Aware Tag Anticollision Protocols for RFID Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4967596/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"10995278","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Aware Tag Anticollision Protocols for RFID Systems","sourcePdf":"ttm2010010044.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116444S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5340423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"5340423","articleId":"4967596","onlineDate":"26 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4967605,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Ess","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5209941/4967605/4967605-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andreas Ess received the MSc degree in computer science from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH) in 2005.

The complexity of the problem calls for an integrated solution that extracts as much visual information as possible and combines it through cognitive feedback cycles. We propose such an approach, which jointly estimates camera position, stereo depth, object detection, and tracking. The interplay between those components is represented by a graphical model. Since the model has to incorporate object-object interactions and temporal links to past frames, direct inference is intractable. We, therefore, propose a two-stage procedure: for each frame, we first solve a simplified version of the model (disregarding interactions and temporal continuity) to estimate the scene geometry and an overcomplete set of object detections. Conditioned on these results, we then address object interactions, tracking, and prediction in a second step. The approach is experimentally evaluated on several long and difficult video sequences from busy inner-city locations. Our results show that the proposed integration makes it possible to deliver robust tracking performance in scenes of realistic complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2009.109","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5209941/04967605.pdf","startPage":"1831","endPage":"1846","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2009.109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5209941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Multiperson Tracking from a Mobile Platform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4967605","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4967605/","displayDocTitle":"Robust Multiperson Tracking from a Mobile Platform","volume":"31","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10840331","pubMedId":"19696453","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4967605/","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Multiperson Tracking from a Mobile Platform","sourcePdf":"ttp2009101831.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153151S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5209941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"207","xplore-issue":"5209941","articleId":"4967605","onlineDate":"26 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":4967607,"authors":[{"name":"Huijun Di","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Pervasive Computing, Ministry of Education, Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5209941/4967607/4967607-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huijun Di received the BE degree in computer science from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2002.

Consequently, elastic motion estimation by explicit feature matching actually contains two correlated subproblems: shape registration and motion tracking, which account for spatial smoothness and temporal continuity, respectively. If we ignore their interrelationship, solving each of them alone will be rather challenging, especially when the cluttered features are involved. To integrate them into a probabilistic model, one straightforward approach is to draw the dependence between their hidden states. With regard to their separated states, there are, however, two different explanations of motion which are still made under the individual constraint of smoothness or continuity. Each one can be error-prone, and their coupling causes error propagation. Therefore, it is highly desirable to design a probabilistic model in which a unified state is shared by the two subproblems. This paper is intended to propose such a model, i.e., a Mixture of Transformed Hidden Markov Models (MTHMM), where a unique explanation of motion is made simultaneously under the spatiotemporal constraints. As a result, the MTHMM could find a coherent global interpretation of elastic motion from local cluttered edge features, and experiments show its robustness under ambiguities, data missing, and outliers.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2009.111","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5209941/04967607.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2009.111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5209941","startPage":"1817","endPage":"1830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Mixture of Transformed Hidden Markov Models for Elastic Motion Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4967607","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Mixture of Transformed Hidden Markov Models for Elastic Motion Estimation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4967607/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10840332","pubMedId":"19696452","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4967607/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Mixture of Transformed Hidden Markov Models for Elastic Motion Estimation","sourcePdf":"ttp2009101817.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103358S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5209941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5209941","articleId":"4967607","onlineDate":"26 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4967608,"authors":[{"name":"Vijay Mahadevan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Mahadevan","id":"37282151300"},{"name":"Nuno Vasconcelos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Nuno","lastName":"Vasconcelos","id":"37282663400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"4967608","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":295,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":2937},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"abstract":"A spatiotemporal saliency algorithm based on a center-surround framework is proposed. The algorithm is inspired by biological mechanisms of motion-based perceptual grouping and extends a discriminant formulation of center-surround saliency previously proposed for static imagery. Under this formulation, the saliency of a location is equated to the power of a predefined set of features to discriminate between the visual stimuli in a center and a surround window, centered at that location. The features are spatiotemporal video patches and are modeled as dynamic textures, to achieve a principled joint characterization of the spatial and temporal components of saliency. The combination of discriminant center-surround saliency with the modeling power of dynamic textures yields a robust, versatile, and fully unsupervised spatiotemporal saliency algorithm, applicable to scenes with highly dynamic backgrounds and moving cameras. The related problem of background subtraction is treated as the complement of saliency detection, by classifying nonsalient (with respect to appearance and motion dynamics) points in the visual field as background. The algorithm is tested for background subtraction on challenging sequences, and shown to substantially outperform various state-of-the-art techniques. Quantitatively, its average error rate is almost half that of the closest competitor.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5339303/04967608.pdf","startPage":"171","endPage":"177","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2009.112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2009.112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339303","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4967608","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatiotemporal Saliency in Dynamic Scenes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spatiotemporal phenomena","Layout","Cameras","Robustness","Motion detection","Optical filters","Testing","Error analysis","Birds","Snow"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image motion analysis","object detection","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatiotemporal saliency algorithm","dynamic scenes","biological mechanisms","motion-based perceptual grouping","center-surround saliency","spatiotemporal video patches","saliency detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spatiotemporal saliency","background subtraction","dynamic backgrounds","motion saliency","dynamic texture","discriminant center-surround architecture","video modeling."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Markov Chains","Models, Theoretical","Normal Distribution","Pattern Recognition, Automated","ROC Curve","Video Recording","Vision, Ocular","Visual Perception"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4967608/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Spatiotemporal Saliency in Dynamic Scenes","volume":"32","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4967608/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"10985558","pubMedId":"19926907","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatiotemporal Saliency in Dynamic Scenes","sourcePdf":"ttp2010010171.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104585S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5339303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"295","xplore-issue":"5339303","articleId":"4967608","onlineDate":"26 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4967611,"authors":[{"name":"Pew-Thian Yap","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5466012/4967611/4967611-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pew-Thian Yap received the PhD degree in image processing from the University of Malaya in 2007.

We call these transforms Polar Harmonic Transforms (PHTs). Unlike the well-known Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, the kernel computation of PHTs is extremely simple and has no numerical stability issue whatsoever. This implies that PHTs encompass the orthogonality and invariance advantages of Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, but are free from their inherent limitations. This also means that PHTs are well suited for application where maximal discriminant information is needed. Furthermore, PHTs make available a large set of features for further feature selection in the process of seeking for the best discriminative or representative features for a particular application.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2009.119","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5466012/04967611.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2009.119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5466012","startPage":"1259","endPage":"1270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Dimensional Polar Harmonic Transforms for Invariant Image Representation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4967611","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Two-Dimensional Polar Harmonic Transforms for Invariant Image Representation","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4967611/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"32","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11340960","pubMedId":"20489228","dateOfInsertion":"18 May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/4967611/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Dimensional Polar Harmonic Transforms for Invariant Image Representation","sourcePdf":"ttp2010071259.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120288S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5466012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"154","xplore-issue":"5466012","articleId":"4967611","onlineDate":"26 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":4967641,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyu Liu","affiliation":["Laboratory of Computational Neuroscience, Departments of Neurosurgery, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Bioengineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaoyu Liu","id":"37087182107"},{"name":"Fei Zhang","affiliation":["Laboratory of Computational Neuroscience, Departments of Neurosurgery, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Bioengineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, USA"],"lastName":"Fei Zhang","id":"37087181051"},{"name":"Steven A.

Measured transition loss of ~1 dB has been achieved in the frequency range of 340 to 380 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2009.2020043","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/5068488/04967856.pdf","startPage":"413","endPage":"415","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2009.2020043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5068488","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 340\u2013380 GHz Integrated CB-CPW-to-Waveguide Transition for Sub Millimeter-Wave MMIC Packaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4967856","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4967856/","displayDocTitle":"A 340\u2013380 GHz Integrated CB-CPW-to-Waveguide Transition for Sub Millimeter-Wave MMIC Packaging","volume":"19","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10714157","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4967856/","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 340\u2013380 GHz Integrated CB-CPW-to-Waveguide Transition for Sub Millimeter-Wave MMIC Packaging","sourcePdf":"lmwc-leong-2020043.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074807S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"5068488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"5068488","articleId":"4967856","onlineDate":"26 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":4967865,"authors":[{"name":"Radu Prodan","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria"],"firstName":"Radu","lastName":"Prodan","id":"37299754000"},{"name":"Marek Wieczorek","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria","Google, Inc., Cracow, Poland"],"firstName":"Marek","lastName":"Wieczorek","id":"37548950300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-5955"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3783"}],"articleNumber":"4967865","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":53,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":646},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4967865","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Processor scheduling","Dynamic programming","Scheduling algorithm","Algorithm design and analysis","Grid computing","Dynamic scheduling","Heuristic algorithms","Computational modeling","Constraint optimization","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic programming","grid computing","knapsack problems","natural sciences computing","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scientific grid workflows","grid computing","scientific workflow management","multicriteria scheduling algorithms","bicriteria scheduling specification method","multiple choice knapsack problem","bicriteria scheduling heuristic","dynamic constraint algorithm","dynamic programming","hydrological application","Austrian grid environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed computing","dynamic programming","scheduling"]}],"abstract":"The drift towards new challenges in Grid computing including scientific workflow management implies the need for new, robust, multicriteria scheduling algorithms that can be applied by the user in an intuitive way. Currently existing bi-criteria scheduling approaches for scientific workflows are usually restricted to certain criterion pairs and require the user to define his preferences either as weights assigned each criterion or as fixed constraints defined for one criterion. The first approach has the drawback that combining multiple criteria into a single objective function is not always intuitive to the end-user, while the second requires \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a priori</i>\n knowledge about the result of the first criteria scheduling result. We propose a new bi-criteria scheduling specification method defining for the secondary criterion a sliding constraint as a function of the primary criterion. We model the problem as an extension of the multiple-choice knapsack problem and propose a general bi-criteria scheduling heuristic called dynamic constraint algorithm (DCA) based on dynamic programming. We show through simulation that in most of the experimental cases DCA outperforms two existing algorithms designed for the same problem at the expense of an increased execution time, which is still relatively low for workflows of medium size. Finally, we confirm our simulation results for a real-world hydrological application executed in the Austrian Grid environment.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2009.2014643","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2009.2014643","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/8856/5443442/04967865.pdf","startPage":"364","endPage":"376","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5443442","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bi-Criteria Scheduling of Scientific Grid Workflows","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bi-Criteria Scheduling of Scientific Grid Workflows","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4967865/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11208207","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bi-Criteria Scheduling of Scientific Grid Workflows","sourcePdf":"tase-prodan-2014643.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044588S","chronDate":"April  2010","isNumber":"5443442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"53","articleId":"4967865","onlineDate":"26 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4967867,"authors":[{"name":"Yung-Nien Jen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5161480/4967867/4967867-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yung-Nien Jen (S'09) was born in Taipei, Taiwan, on April 13, 1984.

Compared with the conventional waveguide construction, this type of Blass matrix possesses the properties of lower cost, easier fabrication and low profile.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4967877/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10714145","htmlLink":"/document/4967877/","displayDocTitle":"A Double Layer Substrate Integrated Waveguide Blass Matrix for Beamforming Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Double Layer Substrate Integrated Waveguide Blass Matrix for Beamforming Applications","sourcePdf":"lmwc-chen-2020020.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048558S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"5068488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5068488","articleId":"4967877","onlineDate":"26 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4967881,"authors":[{"name":"Yurong Liu","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yurong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37405173900"},{"name":"Zidong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems and Computing, Brunei University, Uxbridge, Middlesex, UK"],"firstName":"Zidong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37279246200"},{"name":"Jinling Liang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jinling","lastName":"Liang","id":"37406930100"},{"name":"Xiaohui Liu","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems and Computing, Brunei University, Uxbridge, Middlesex, UK"],"firstName":"Xiaohui","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280573800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"4967881","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":281,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1370},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Delay effects","Biological neural networks","Stability analysis","Linear matrix inequalities","Stochastic processes","Councils","Mathematics","Sufficient conditions","Lyapunov method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","discrete time systems","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods","Markov processes","neural nets","stability","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronization","discrete-time Markovian jumping neural networks","mixed mode-dependent time delays","Markov chain","discrete delays","distributed delays","stability analysis","Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional","linear matrix inequalities","stochastic stability","Lyapunov stability theory","Kronecker product","matrix norm theories","unified LMI approach","Matlab LMI toolbox"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete-time neural networks (DNNs)","linear matrix inequality","Markovian jumping parameters","mixed time delays","stochastic stability","synchronization"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Computer Simulation","Linear Models","Markov Chains","Mathematical Computing","Neural Networks (Computer)","Software","Software Validation","Stochastic Processes","Time Factors"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a new class of discrete-time neural networks (DNNs) with Markovian jumping parameters as well as mode-dependent mixed time delays (both discrete and distributed time delays). Specifically, the parameters of the DNNs are subject to the switching from one to another at different times according to a Markov chain, and the mixed time delays consist of both discrete and distributed delays that are dependent on the Markovian jumping mode. We first deal with the stability analysis problem of the addressed neural networks. A special inequality is developed to account for the mixed time delays in the discrete-time setting, and a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is put forward to reflect the mode-dependent time delays. Sufficient conditions are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) that guarantee the stochastic stability. We then turn to the synchronization problem among an array of identical coupled Markovian jumping neural networks with mixed mode-dependent time delays. By utilizing the Lyapunov stability theory and the Kronecker product, it is shown that the addressed synchronization problem is solvable if several LMIs are feasible. Hence, different from the commonly used matrix norm theories (such as the M-matrix method), a unified LMI approach is developed to solve the stability analysis and synchronization problems of the class of neural networks under investigation, where the LMIs can be easily solved by using the available Matlab LMI toolbox. Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the main results obtained.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability and Synchronization of Discrete-Time Markovian Jumping Neural Networks With Mixed Mode-Dependent Time Delays","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2009.2016210","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5159575/04967881.pdf","startPage":"1102","endPage":"1116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2009.2016210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159575","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4967881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4967881/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"Stability and Synchronization of Discrete-Time Markovian Jumping Neural Networks With Mixed Mode-Dependent Time Delays","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10774891","pubMedId":"19473937","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability and Synchronization of Discrete-Time Markovian Jumping Neural Networks With Mixed Mode-Dependent Time Delays","sourcePdf":"tnn-liu-2016210.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061666S","chronDate":"July  2009","isNumber":"5159575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"281","articleId":"4967881","onlineDate":"26 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4967885,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Yang","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Cupertino, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/5073253/4967885/4967885-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ming Yang (M'08) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2001 and 2004, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, in June 2008.","From 2004 to 2008, he was a Research Assistant with Prof. Y.

However, in general, the appearances are often nonstationary which may ruin the predefined visual measurements and often lead to tracking failure in practice. Thus, a natural solution is to adapt the observation model to the nonstationary appearances. However, this idea is threatened by the risk of adaptation drift that originates in its ill-posed nature, unless good data-driven constraints are imposed. Different from most existing adaptation schemes, we enforce three novel constraints for the optimal adaptation: (1) negative data, (2) bottom-up pair-wise data constraints, and (3) adaptation dynamics. Substantializing the general adaptation problem as a subspace adaptation problem, this paper presents a closed-form solution as well as a practical iterative algorithm for subspace tracking. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed approach can largely alleviate adaptation drift and achieve better tracking results for a large variety of nonstationary scenes.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Laboratories","Closed-form solution","Iterative algorithms","Layout","Adaptation model","Video surveillance","Lighting","Shape","National electric code"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonstationary visual appearances tracking","data-driven adaptation","visual tracking","visual measurements","tracking failure","negative data","bottom-up pair-wise data constraints","adaptation dynamics","closed-form solution","practical iterative algorithm","subspace tracking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Appearance model adaptation","subspace tracking","visual tracking"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2019807","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5073253/04967885.pdf","startPage":"1633","endPage":"1644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2019807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking Nonstationary Visual Appearances by Data-Driven Adaptation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4967885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tracking Nonstationary Visual Appearances by Data-Driven Adaptation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4967885/","volume":"18","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4967885/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10704738","pubMedId":"19473941","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking Nonstationary Visual Appearances by Data-Driven Adaptation","sourcePdf":"18tip07-myang-2019807.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089882S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5073253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5073253","articleId":"4967885","onlineDate":"26 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4967888,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Raspaud","affiliation":["ITN Group, Link\u00f6ping University, Norrkoping, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5286797/4967888/4967888-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Martin Raspaud received the double M.S. diploma in computer science from the University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France, in 2003 and the Ph.D. degree in sound processing from the University of Bordeaux, funded by the French Ministry of Research.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Link\u00f6ping, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden."]},"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Raspaud","id":"37569599300"},{"name":"Harald Viste","affiliation":["Widex A/S, Vaerlose, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5286797/4967888/4967888-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Harald Viste received the Sivilingeni\u00f8r degree in industrial mathematics from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway, in 1997, and the Ph.D. degree in communication systems from the Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland, in 2004.","He is currently with Widex A/S, V\u00e6rl\u00f8se, Denmark."]},"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Viste","id":"37646189100"},{"name":"Gianpaolo Evangelista","affiliation":["ITN Group, Link\u00f6ping University, Norrkoping, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5286797/4967888/4967888-photo-3-source-small.gif","p":["Gianpaolo Evangelista (M'92\u2013SM'08) received the laurea degree (summa cum laude) in physics from \u201cFederico II\u201d University of Naples, Naples, Italy, in 1984 and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of California, Irvine, in 1987 and 1990, respectively.","From 1985 to 1986, he was with the Centre d'Etudes de Math\u00e9matique et Acoustique Musicale (CEMAMu/CNET), Paris, France.

The performance of a routing algorithm under uncertain traffic demands is characterized by the oblivious performance ratio that bounds the relative performance of the routing algorithm with respect to the optimal algorithm for any given traffic demand. We consider both single-path routing, where only one path is used to carry the traffic between each source-destination pair, and multipath routing, where multiple paths are allowed. For single-path routing, we derive lower bounds of the oblivious performance ratio for different fat-trees and develop routing schemes that achieve the optimal oblivious performance ratios for commonly used topologies. Our evaluation results indicate that the proposed oblivious routing schemes not only provide the optimal worst-case performance guarantees but also outperform existing schemes in average cases.

Typically this is done using examples in antennas, scattering, or electrostatics. Unfortunately, many difficult issues arise in the formulation and solution of the associated equations. It is instead proposed to use examples from transmission lines, a topic with which undergraduate students are both familiar and comfortable.

The IGBT were subjected to thermal overstress tests using a transistor test board until device latch-up. The collector-emitter current, transistor case temperature, transient and steady state gate voltages, and transient and steady state collector-emitter voltages were monitored in-situ during the test. Pre- and post-aging characterization tests were performed on the IGBT. The aged parts were observed to have shifts in capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements as a result of trapped charge in the gate oxide. The collector-emitter ON voltage V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">CE(ON)</sub>\n showed a reduction with aging.

An FDTD code is used to compute the excitation fields of the lines. Additional voltage sources, which denote the effect of the excitation fields, are computed with the results obtained by the FDTD method and incorporated into a SPICE model. The hybrid method can be used for nonlinear or time-varying loads, because the SPICE model allows easy incorporation of nonlinear or time-varying loads. Three cases, two transmission lines and a network, all inside a cavity excited by an incident electromagnetic field, are computed by using the presented method. The numerical results are compared with those obtained by using a 3D FDTD code, and the agreement is generally good. The time needed by the hybrid method is much less than that needed by the FDTD code, because the lines can be ignored when the excitation fields of the lines are computed in the hybrid method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/5208461/04967930.pdf","startPage":"811","endPage":"817","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2009.2020913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2009.2020913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208461","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4967930","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid FDTD-SPICE Method for Transmission Lines Excited by a Nonuniform Incident Wave","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["SPICE","Finite difference methods","Computational modeling","Power transmission lines","Time domain analysis","Cavity resonators","Transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","SPICE","transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite-difference time-domain analysis","simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis","lossless transmission lines","nonuniform incident wave","excitation fields"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-difference time domain (FDTD)","simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis (SPICE) model","transmission lines"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4967930/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid FDTD-SPICE Method for Transmission Lines Excited by a Nonuniform Incident Wave","volume":"51","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4967930/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10828807","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid FDTD-SPICE Method for Transmission Lines Excited by a Nonuniform Incident Wave","sourcePdf":"temc-Xie-2020913.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124822S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"5208461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5208461","articleId":"4967930","onlineDate":"26 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4967940,"authors":[{"name":"Gianluca Paravati","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/5235148/4967940/4967940-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gianluca Paravati received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electronic engineering from Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy, in 2005 and 2007, respectively.","He is currently a Research Assistant with the Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica, Politecnico di Torino.

This task could be even more critical when real-time requirements have to be taken into account. In this context, techniques exploiting the target intensity profile generated by an intensity variation function (IVF) proved to be capable of providing significant results. However, one of their main limitations is represented by the associated computational cost. In this paper, an alternative approach based on genetic algorithms (GAs) is proposed. GAs are search methods based on evolutionary computations, which exploit operators inspired by genetic variation and natural selection rules. They have been proven to be theoretically and empirically robust in complex space searches by their founder, J. H. Holland. Contrary to most optimization techniques, whose goal is to improve performances toward the optimum, GAs aim at finding near-optimal solutions by performing parallel searches in the solution space. In this paper, an optimized target search strategy relying on GAs and exploiting an evolutionary approach for the computation of the IVF is presented. The proposed methodology was validated on several data sets, and it was compared against the original IVF implementation by Bal and Alam. Experimental results showed that the proposed approach is capable of significantly improving performances by dramatically reducing algorithm processing time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4967940/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10864260","volume":"58","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4967940/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm for Target Tracking in FLIR Video Sequences Using Intensity Variation Function","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Genetic Algorithm for Target Tracking in FLIR Video Sequences Using Intensity Variation Function","sourcePdf":"tim-sanna-2017665.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095557S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5235148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5235148","articleId":"4967940","onlineDate":"26 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4967945,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00c9 Carlos Prieto","affiliation":["LOPSI Group, Instituto de Autom\u00e1tica Industrial, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/5159565/4967945/4967945-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jos\u00e9 Carlos Prieto was born in Le\u00f3n, Spain, in 1978.

However, their performance is commonly limited by the transducers' frequency bandwidth and emission pattern. 3D-LOCUS is a new advanced acoustic LPS that claims subcentimeter accuracy even in turbulent environments. This is achieved through the use of broadband omnidirectional transducers, suitable design of emitted signals, proper calibration, and bidirectional emissions. This paper evaluates the 3D-LOCUS LPS by providing results in terms of some positioning metrics such as accuracy, resolution, and coverage, which show how it outperforms other state-of-the-art LPS prototypes. 3D-LOCUS operating in bidirectional mode minimizes environmental effects, such as temperature and airflows, attaining localization errors below 9 mm with a 90% confidence level, an RMS error below 7.4 mm, and 5 mm resolution in a localization volume of 2 times 2 times 0.4 m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation of 3D-LOCUS Advanced Acoustic LPS","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2009.2016378","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/5159565/04967945.pdf","startPage":"2385","endPage":"2395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2009.2016378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159565","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4967945","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4967945/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation of 3D-LOCUS Advanced Acoustic LPS","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4967945/","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10774755","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation of 3D-LOCUS Advanced Acoustic LPS","sourcePdf":"tim-prieto-2016378.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07595S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5159565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"5159565","articleId":"4967945","onlineDate":"26 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4967951,"authors":[{"name":"Akihide Sano","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5170198/4967951/4967951-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Akihide Sano (M'08) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in physics and Ph.D. degree in communication engineering from Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, in 1990, 1992, and 2007, respectively.","In 1992, he joined the NTT Transmission Systems Laboratories, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan, where he was engaged in research and development on high-speed optical communication systems, Since April 2005, he has been with NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan.

We examine the transmission characteristics of the proposed scheme, and show that No-GI CO-OFDM offers compact signal spectra and superior performance with regard to tolerance against optical amplifier noise and polarization-mode dispersion (PMD).

Minimally invasive solutions, based on X-ray imaging and coregistered external navigation created a lot of interest within the surgical community and started to replace the traditional open surgery for many procedures. These solutions usually increase the accuracy and reduce the trauma. In general, they introduce new hardware into the OR and add the line of sight constraints imposed by optical tracking systems. They thus impose radical changes to the surgical setup and overall procedure. We augment a commonly used mobile C-arm with a standard video camera and a double mirror system allowing real-time fusion of optical and X-ray images. The video camera is mounted such that its optical center virtually coincides with the C-arm's X-ray source. After a one-time calibration routine, the acquired X-ray and optical images are coregistered. This paper describes the design of such a system, quantifies its technical accuracy, and provides a qualitative proof of its efficiency through cadaver studies conducted by trauma surgeons. In particular, it studies the relevance of this system for surgical navigation within pedicle screw placement, vertebroplasty, and intramedullary nail locking procedures. The image overlay provides an intuitive interface for surgical guidance with an accuracy of <;1 mm, ideally with the use of only one single X-ray image. The new system is smoothly integrated into the clinical application with no additional hardware especially for down-the-beam instrument guidance based on the anteroposterior oblique view, where the instrument axis is aligned with the X-ray source. Throughout all experiments, the camera augmented mobile C-arm system proved to be an intuitive and robust guidance solution for selected clinical routines.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2009.2021947","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/5497028/04967956.pdf","startPage":"1412","endPage":"1423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2009.2021947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5497028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Camera Augmented Mobile C-Arm (CAMC): Calibration, Accuracy Study, and Clinical Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4967956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4967956/","displayDocTitle":"Camera Augmented Mobile C-Arm (CAMC): Calibration, Accuracy Study, and Clinical Applications","volume":"29","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11469701","pubMedId":"20659830","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4967956/","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Camera Augmented Mobile C-Arm (CAMC): Calibration, Accuracy Study, and Clinical Applications","sourcePdf":"tmi-nnavab-2021947-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095805S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"5497028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"5497028","articleId":"4967956","onlineDate":"26 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4967963,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad S.

A family of interpolated schemes using a rectilinear, nonstaggered grid is reviewed, and the most accurate and isotropic schemes are identified. Frequency-dependent boundaries are modeled using a digital impedance filter formulation that is consistent with locally reacting surface theory. A structurally stable and efficient boundary formulation is constructed by carefully combining the boundary condition with the interpolated scheme. An analytic prediction formula for the effective numerical reflectance is given, and a stability proof provided. The results indicate that the identified accurate and isotropic schemes are also very accurate in terms of numerical boundary reflectance, and outperform directly related methods such as Yee's scheme and the standard digital waveguide mesh. In addition, one particular scheme-referred to here as the interpolated wideband scheme-is suggested as the best scheme for most applications.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2009.2023645","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5286797/04967978.pdf","startPage":"78","endPage":"89","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2009.2023645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5286797","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband and Isotropic Room Acoustics Simulation Using 2-D Interpolated FDTD Schemes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4967978","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4967978/","displayDocTitle":"Wideband and Isotropic Room Acoustics Simulation Using 2-D Interpolated FDTD Schemes","volume":"18","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"10927050","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4967978/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband and Isotropic Room Acoustics Simulation Using 2-D Interpolated FDTD Schemes","sourcePdf":"17tasl06-kkowalczyk-2023645.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078736S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5286797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5286797","articleId":"4967978","onlineDate":"26 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4967983,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroyuki Takeda","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/5200729/4967983/4967983-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hiroyuki Takeda (S'05) received the B.S. degree in electronics from Kinki University, Osaka, Japan, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), in 2001 and 2006, respectively.

In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for adaptive enhancement and spatiotemporal upscaling of videos containing complex activities without explicit need for accurate motion estimation. Our approach is based on multidimensional kernel regression, where each pixel in the video sequence is approximated with a 3-D local (Taylor) series, capturing the essential local behavior of its spatiotemporal neighborhood. The coefficients of this series are estimated by solving a local weighted least-squares problem, where the weights are a function of the 3-D space-time orientation in the neighborhood. As this framework is fundamentally based upon the comparison of neighboring pixels in both space and time, it implicitly contains information about the local motion of the pixels across time, therefore rendering unnecessary an explicit computation of motions of modest size. The proposed approach not only significantly widens the applicability of super-resolution methods to a broad variety of video sequences containing complex motions, but also yields improved overall performance. Using several examples, we illustrate that the developed algorithm has super-resolution capabilities that provide improved optical resolution in the output, while being able to work on general input video with essentially arbitrary motion.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2023703","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5200729/04967983.pdf","startPage":"1958","endPage":"1975","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2023703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Super-Resolution Without Explicit Subpixel Motion Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4967983","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4967983/","displayDocTitle":"Super-Resolution Without Explicit Subpixel Motion Estimation","volume":"18","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10816684","pubMedId":"19473940","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4967983/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Super-Resolution Without Explicit Subpixel Motion Estimation","sourcePdf":"18tip09-pmilanfar-2023703.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082756S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5200729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"215","xplore-issue":"5200729","articleId":"4967983","onlineDate":"26 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4967986,"authors":[{"name":"C\u00c9dric Wemmert","affiliation":["University of Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France"],"firstName":"C\u00c9dric","lastName":"Wemmert","id":"37442728400"},{"name":"Anne Puissant","affiliation":["University of Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France"],"firstName":"Anne","lastName":"Puissant","id":"37645748800"},{"name":"Germain Forestier","affiliation":["University of Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France"],"firstName":"Germain","lastName":"Forestier","id":"37541760500"},{"name":"Pierre Gancarski","affiliation":["University of Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Gancarski","id":"37442728600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"4967986","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":515},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4967986","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiresolution Remote Sensing Image Clustering","abstract":"With the multiplication of satellite images with complementary spatial and spectral resolution, a major issue in the classification process is the simultaneous use of several images. In this context, the objective of this letter is to propose a new method which uses information contained in both spatial resolutions. The main idea is that on one hand, the semantic level associated with an image depends on its spatial resolution, and on the other hand, information given by these images is complementary. The goal of this multiresolution image method is to automatically build a classification using knowledge extracted from both images, by unsupervised way and without preprocessing image fusion. The method is tested by using a Quickbird (2.8 m) and a SPOT-4 (20 m) image on the urban area of Strasbourg (France).

This sparsity of defect occurrence within the software system impedes training and performance of software quality estimation models.

We present a novel genetic algorithm-based data sampling method, named evolutionary sampling, as a solution to improving software quality modeling for high-assurance systems. The proposed solution is compared with multiple existing data sampling techniques, including random undersampling, one-sided selection, Wilson's editing, random oversampling, cluster-based oversampling, synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), and borderline-SMOTE. This paper involves case studies of two real-world software systems and builds C4.5- and RIPPER-based software quality models both before and after applying a given data sampling technique. It is empirically shown that evolutionary sampling improves performance of software quality models for high-assurance systems and is significantly better than most existing data sampling techniques.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2009.2020804","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/5208652/04967988.pdf","startPage":"1097","endPage":"1107","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2009.2020804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolutionary Sampling and Software Quality Modeling of High-Assurance Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Evolutionary Sampling and Software Quality Modeling of High-Assurance Systems","volume":"39","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4967988/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10828542","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4967988/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolutionary Sampling and Software Quality Modeling of High-Assurance Systems","sourcePdf":"tsmca-khoshgoftaar-2020804.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07282S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"5208652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5208652","articleId":"4967988","onlineDate":"26 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4967989,"authors":[{"name":"Karl S.

For in-depth analysis, we compare to existing methods and draw parallels between intuitive concepts including classification and ideas introduced by other nearest neighbor algorithms by explaining manifolds in low and high dimensions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4967989/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4967989/","accessionNumber":"10816686","pubMedId":"19473939","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptable <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$k$</tex> </formula>-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm for MMSE Image Interpolation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptable <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$k$</tex> </formula>-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm for MMSE Image Interpolation","sourcePdf":"18tip09-kni-2023706.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112612S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5200729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5200729","articleId":"4967989","onlineDate":"26 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4968006,"authors":[{"name":"Raghunath Murali","affiliation":["Nanotechnology Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Raghunath","lastName":"Murali","id":"37266500800"},{"name":"Kevin Brenner","affiliation":["Nanotechnology Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Brenner","id":"37392699200"},{"name":"Yinxiao Yang","affiliation":["Nanotechnology Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Yinxiao","lastName":"Yang","id":"37406581900"},{"name":"Thomas Beck","affiliation":["Nanotechnology Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Beck","id":"37574117600"},{"name":"James D.

It is found that the average resistivity at a given linewidth(18 nm < W< 52 nm) is about three times that of a Cu wire, whereas the best GNR has a resistivity that is comparable to that of Cu. The conductivity is found to be limited by impurity scattering as well as line-edge roughness scattering; as a result, the best reported GNR resistivity is three times the limit imposed by substrate phonon scattering. This letter reveals that even moderate-quality graphene nanowires have the potential to outperform Cu for use as on-chip interconnects.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/55/4968003/04968006.pdf","startPage":"611","endPage":"613","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","doi":"10.1109/LED.2009.2020182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2009.2020182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4968003","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4968006","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resistivity of Graphene Nanoribbon Interconnects","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conductivity","Plasma measurements","Scattering","Substrates","Electrical resistance measurement","Performance evaluation","Nanowires","Silicon","CMOS technology","Ballistic transport"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical resistivity","graphene","impurity scattering","integrated circuit interconnections","nanowires"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graphene nanoribbon interconnects","extracted resistivity","conductivity","impurity scattering","line-edge roughness scattering","substrate phonon scattering","graphene nanowires","on-chip interconnects","Cu"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Graphene","nanoribbon","resistivity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4968006/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Resistivity of Graphene Nanoribbon Interconnects","volume":"30","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4968006/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10666151","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resistivity of Graphene Nanoribbon Interconnects","sourcePdf":"led-murali-2020182.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051613S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"4968003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"162","xplore-issue":"4968003","articleId":"4968006","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4968008,"authors":[{"name":"William Lepkowski","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, the Center for Solid State Electronics Research, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Lepkowski","id":"37295242700"},{"name":"Joseph Ervin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, the Center for Solid State Electronics Research, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Ervin","id":"37286173500"},{"name":"Seth J.

The Schottky gate of the MESFET is formed from a metal silicide that consumes most of the thin ( < 50 nm) FD-SOI channel and fully depletes the remaining underlying silicon. Therefore, unlike partially depleted SOI MESFETs with a thicker silicon layer ( ~ 200 nm), the conducting channel of the FD-SOI MESFET cannot be formed directly under the Schottky gate. Instead, current flow in the FD-SOI MESFET is confined between islands of silicide that deplete the conducting channel in a lateral direction. The FD-SOI MESFETs operate as depletion mode devices with a threshold voltage that can be adjusted by varying the separation between the silicide islands. Both n- and p-channel devices can be realized using the same gate material on a common FD-SOI substrate.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS technology","MESFETs","Silicides","Silicon on insulator technology","CMOS process","Threshold voltage","Foundries","Conducting materials","Substrates","Semiconductor materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","Schottky gate field effect transistors","semiconductor device models","silicon-on-insulator"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SOI MESFET fabrication","fully depleted CMOS technology","ultrathin channel metal-semiconductor field-effect transistor","silicon-on-insulator CMOS foundries","Schottky gate","metal silicide","FD SOI channel","partially depleted SOI MESFET","conducting channel","n channel device","p channel device","FD-SOI substrate","size 200 nm","Si-SiO2"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS processing","fully depleted","metal\u2013semiconductor field-effect-transistors (MESFETs)","Schottky junction","silicon-on-insulator (SOI)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LED.2009.2020523","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/55/4968003/04968008.pdf","startPage":"678","endPage":"680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4968003","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2009.2020523","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SOI MESFETs Fabricated Using Fully Depleted CMOS Technologies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4968008","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SOI MESFETs Fabricated Using Fully Depleted CMOS Technologies","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4968008/","volume":"30","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4968008/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10666185","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SOI MESFETs Fabricated Using Fully Depleted CMOS Technologies","sourcePdf":"led-thornton-2020523.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079236S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"4968003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4968003","articleId":"4968008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4968044,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Chen","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Gang Chen","id":"37403714000"},{"name":"Guobo Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Guobo Li","id":"37405541300"},{"name":"Songwen Pei","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Songwen Pei","id":"37396862400"},{"name":"Baifeng Wu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Baifeng Wu","id":"37275267100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3534-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3535-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4968044","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Computational modeling","Graphics","Costs","Physics computing","Computer simulation","High performance computing","Parallel algorithms","Arithmetic","Biomedical computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","molecular dynamics method","parallel algorithms","physics computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["molecular dynamics simulations","GPGPU supported cooperative acceleration","general purpose graphics processing unit","AMD's Brook+ streaming programming environment","parallel algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Molecular dynamics (MD)","GPU","GPGPU","Brook+"]}],"abstract":"Molecular dynamics simulations have become a significant computational approach to study complicated physical phenomena at the atomic level. Nevertheless, accurate simulations are limited in size and timescale by the available computing resources, which make the simulations very time-consuming. This consequentially leads to tremendous computational requirements. Therefore, the need for speeding up this process is crucial. In this paper, we present a novel implementation to accelerate molecular dynamics simulations with GPGPU (general purpose graphics processing unit). Our goal is to reduce the total computational time of MD simulations at a very high performance/cost ratio with the introduction of the GPGPU algorithm. This is motivated by their enhanced programmability, attractive cost/performance ratio and incredible growth in speed. To demonstrate that GPGPUs already provide an inexpensive alternative to scientific applications, we have used AMD's Brook+ streaming programming environment to implement a new parallel algorithm. Our experimental results show the novel approach achieves speedup by the factor of fifteen compared to the corresponding sequential implementation.","doi":"10.1109/CSCWD.2009.4968044","publicationTitle":"2009 13th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 13th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4925075/4968016/04968044.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSCWD.2009.4968044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4968016","startPage":"113","endPage":"118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPGPU supported cooperative acceleration in molecular dynamics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4968044","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"GPGPU supported cooperative acceleration in molecular dynamics","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4968044/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685927","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4968044/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPGPU supported cooperative acceleration in molecular dynamics","confLoc":"Santiago, Chile","sourcePdf":"CSCWD_3413.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05603S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4925075","isNumber":"4968016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4925075","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4968016","articleId":"4968044","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4968052,"authors":[{"name":"Joao Carlos de A.R.
