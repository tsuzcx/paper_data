The new method is a data-driven approach which extracts a set of coordinates that directly parameterize nonlinearities present in hyperspectral imagery, both on land and in the water column. The motivation for such a parameterization and its applicability to coastal bathymetry is based on the physical expectation that in shallow waters in a region that is homogeneous in bottom type and dissolved constituents, the reflectance at any particular wavelength should decay exponentially as a function of depth. If the rate varies with wavelength, then the reflectance should best be described by a nonlinear sheet or manifold in spectral space. Other changes in the structure of the data manifold can be expected as inherent optical properties (IOP) and bottom type vary. The manifold coordinates can be used to extract information concerning the latter as well. In the present work, we compare a manifold coordinate based approach to extracting bathymetry with prior work [Maness et al., 2005] based on radiative transfer modeling; the latter defined a set of look-up tables produced by repeated execution of a radiative transfer software package known as EcoLight. Comparative results for the two approaches are presented for the same Portable Hyperspectral Imager for low-light spectroscopy (PHILLS) airborne hyperspectral scene, acquired over the Indian River Lagoon in Florida in July 2004 and described in [Maness et al., 2005].","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2005.1640099","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34367","startPage":"2242","endPage":"2249 Vol. 3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of OCEANS 2005 MTS/IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10918/34367/01640099.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new data-driven approach to modeling coastal bathymetry from hyperspectral imagery using manifold coordinates","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640099/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-23 Sept. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1640099/","displayDocTitle":"A new data-driven approach to modeling coastal bathymetry from hyperspectral imagery using manifold coordinates","conferenceDate":"17-23 Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8995990","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new data-driven approach to modeling coastal bathymetry from hyperspectral imagery using manifold coordinates","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01640099.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094764S","chronDate":"17-23 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10918","isNumber":"34367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10918","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"34367","articleId":"1640099","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"MTS","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1640111,"authors":[{"name":"Seung-Geun Kim","affiliation":["Ocean Engineering, Korea Research Institute of Ships and Ocean Engineering, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seung-Geun Kim","id":"37404981600"},{"name":"Youngchol Choi","affiliation":["Ocean Engineering, Korea Research Institute of Ships and Ocean Engineering, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Youngchol Choi","id":"37334939500"},{"name":"Sea-Moom Kim","affiliation":["Ocean Engineering, Korea Research Institute of Ships and Ocean Engineering, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sea-Moom Kim","id":"38044017100"},{"name":"Jong-Won Park","affiliation":["Ocean Engineering, Korea Research Institute of Ships and Ocean Engineering, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong-Won Park","id":"37337098700"},{"name":"Young-Kon Lim","affiliation":["Ocean Engineering, Korea Research Institute of Ships and Ocean Engineering, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Young-Kon Lim","id":"37336138100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-933957-34-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-7385"}],"articleNumber":"1640111","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tracking loops","Quadrature phase shift keying","Frequency estimation","Frequency shift keying","Phase estimation","Underwater tracking","Transmitters","Oceans","State estimation","Feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater acoustic communication","quadrature phase shift keying","underwater acoustic propagation","phase locked loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase tracking loop","underwater QPSK transmission","quadrature phase shift keying","second order loop filter","phase fluctuating bound","transient state","steady state","tracking phase error","symbol error rate"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a design method for phase tracking loop with 2nd order loop filter, which can trace a small frequency variation as well as a phase variation.

Although a 3D sonar image provides instantaneous volumetric data sets, many applications require the data sets to be mosaic'ed into larger data sets. The lack of navigation and motion sensors being able to produce mosaics with accuracies comparable to the 3D sonar resolution necessitates the use of registration techniques. Techniques for filtering of 3D sonar data, mesh generation, registration and geometric fusion applied to both on-line and offline mosaicing will be discussed. On-line mosaicing is done at a rate of 5 to 10 data sets per second, a rate that is acceptable in most practical situations. The techniques will find a number of applications, such as scanning harbors and seabed for potentially dangerous objects as well as seabed surveys. As the registration provides the sensor position relative to an object, object related positioning and navigation is also feasible, either as a stand alone underwater navigation system or as a system that improves current techniques like LBL, SBL and others.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2005.1640112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34367","startPage":"2326","endPage":"2333 Vol. 3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of OCEANS 2005 MTS/IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10918/34367/01640112.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mosaicing of 3D sonar data sets - techniques and applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640112/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-23 Sept. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1640112/","displayDocTitle":"Mosaicing of 3D sonar data sets - techniques and applications","conferenceDate":"17-23 Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8996003","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mosaicing of 3D sonar data sets - techniques and applications","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01640112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062682S","chronDate":"17-23 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10918","isNumber":"34367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10918","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"34367","articleId":"1640112","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"MTS","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":1640221,"authors":[{"name":"A.H.

Throughput analysis of these SDFGs is an important step for verifying throughput requirements of concurrent real-time applications, for instance within design-space exploration activities. Analysis of SDFGs can be hard, since the worst-case complexity of analysis algorithms is often high. This is also true for throughput analysis. In particular, many algorithms involve a conversion to another kind of data flow graph, the size of which can be exponentially larger than the size of the original graph. In this paper, we present a method for throughput analysis of SDFGs, based on explicit state-space exploration and we show that the method, despite its worst-case complexity, works well in practice, while existing methods often fail. We demonstrate this by comparing the method with state-of-the-art cycle mean computation algorithms. Moreover, since the state-space exploration method is essentially the same as simulation of the graph, the results of this paper can be easily obtained as a byproduct in existing simulation tools","displayPublicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Application of Concurrency to System Design (ACSD'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10919/34368/01640221.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"36","publicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Application of Concurrency to System Design (ACSD'06)","doi":"10.1109/ACSD.2006.33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSD.2006.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34368","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput Analysis of Synchronous Data Flow Graphs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Data analysis","Flow graphs","Algorithm design and analysis","Signal processing algorithms","Failure analysis","Computational modeling","Analytical models","Data flow computing","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","data flow computing","data flow graphs","embedded systems","multiprocessing systems","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronous data flow graphs","embedded data flow application","worst-case complexity","throughput analysis","cycle mean computation algorithm","state-space exploration method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640221/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Throughput Analysis of Synchronous Data Flow Graphs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1640221/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9113093","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","conferenceDate":"28-30 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput Analysis of Synchronous Data Flow Graphs","confLoc":"Turku, Finland","sourcePdf":"01640221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078003S","chronDate":"28-30 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10919","isNumber":"34368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10919","citationCount":"136","xplore-issue":"34368","articleId":"1640221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1640227,"authors":[{"name":"P.

A major problem with this approach is the selection of a training set: a small set will result in reduced performance, and a large set will require extensive training. In addition, class appearance may change over time requiring an adaptive classification system. In this paper we propose a solution to these basic problems by developing an on-line feature selection method, which continuously modifies and improves the features used for classification based on the examples provided so far. The method is used for learning a new class, and to continuously improve classification performance as new data becomes available. In ongoing learning, examples are continuously presented to the system, and new features arise from these examples. The method continuously measures the value of the selected features using mutual information, and uses these values to efficiently update the set of selected features when new training information becomes available. The problem is challenging because at each stage the training process uses a small subset of the training data. Surprisingly, with sufficient training data the on-line process reaches the same performance as a scheme that has a complete access to the entire training data.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training data","Computer science","Mathematics","Classification algorithms","Application software","Adaptive systems","Mutual information","Degradation","Feature extraction","Data mining"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CRV.2006.46","publicationTitle":"The 3rd Canadian Conference on Computer and Robot Vision (CRV'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"The 3rd Canadian Conference on Computer and Robot Vision (CRV'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10921/34370/01640356.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CRV.2006.46","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to classify by ongoing feature selection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640356","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning to classify by ongoing feature selection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640356/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1640356/","conferenceDate":"7-9 June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"07-09 June 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to classify by ongoing feature selection","confLoc":"Quebec, Canada","sourcePdf":"01640356.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043949S","chronDate":"07-09 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10921","isNumber":"34370","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10921","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"34370","articleId":"1640356","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1640379,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Facial expression, which changes face geometry, usually has an adverse effect on the performance of a face recognition system. On the other hand, face geometry is a useful cue for recognition. Taking these into account, we utilize the idea of separating geometry and texture information in a face image and model the two types of information by projecting them into separate PCA spaces which are specially designed to capture the distinctive features among different individuals. Subsequently, the texture and geometry attributes are re-combined to form a classifier which is capable of recognizing faces with different expressions. Finally, by studying face geometry, we are able to determine which type of facial expression has been carried out, thus build an expression classifier. Numerical validations of the proposed method are given.","doi":"10.1109/CRV.2006.34","publicationTitle":"The 3rd Canadian Conference on Computer and Robot Vision (CRV'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"The 3rd Canadian Conference on Computer and Robot Vision (CRV'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10921/34370/01640432.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CRV.2006.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34370","startPage":"77","endPage":"77","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Expression-Invariant Face Recognition with Expression Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640432","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Expression-Invariant Face Recognition with Expression Classification","chronOrPublicationDate":"07-09 June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640432/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 June 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1640432/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Expression-Invariant Face Recognition with Expression Classification","confLoc":"Quebec, Canada","sourcePdf":"01640432.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044995S","chronDate":"07-09 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10921","isNumber":"34370","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10921","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"34370","articleId":"1640432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1640454,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Our method uses a database of objects from a single class (e.g. hands, human figures) containing example patches of feasible mappings from the appearance to the depth of each object. Given an image of a novel object, we combine the known depths of patches from similar objects to produce a plausible depth estimate. This is achieved by optimizing a global target function representing the likelihood of the candidate depth. We demonstrate how the variability of 3D shapes and their poses can be handled by updating the example database on-the-fly. In addition, we show how we can employ our method for the novel task of recovering an estimate for the occluded backside of the imaged objects.

Most of previous works used generative methods. In this paper, we propose a discriminative method, Bayesian Competitive Model, to explicitly handle the person-unspecific problem. The key idea originates from the observation that it is possible to design a discriminative classifier adaptable for unknown new subject when generic learning is applied. The generic learning functions in two aspects: First, it learns the generic distribution of faces, and thus provides a MAP framework for verification. Second, it learns the intra-personal variations of numerous known persons to infer the distribution of the unknown new subject. Both distributions are formulated in GMM model, respectively. To further improve the performance, we integrate Bayesian Competitive Model with a generative classifier based on confidence. A number of experiments on the BANCA dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the new algorithm in handling the personunspecific problem, and its advantage over existing algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2006.101","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2006.101","startPage":"32","endPage":"32","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop (CVPRW'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10922/34371/01640472.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop (CVPRW'06)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34371","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incorporating Generic Learning to Design Discriminative Classifier Adaptable for Unknown Subject in Face Verification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Incorporating Generic Learning to Design Discriminative Classifier Adaptable for Unknown Subject in Face Verification","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1640472/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640472/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incorporating Generic Learning to Design Discriminative Classifier Adaptable for Unknown Subject in Face Verification","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640472.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061642S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10922","isNumber":"34371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10922","xplore-issue":"34371","articleId":"1640472","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1640475,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Even if SIFT features have emerged as a very powerful image descriptors, their employment in face analysis context has never been systematically investigated. This paper investigates the application of the SIFT approach in the context of face authentication.

Other variations include the presence and absence of eye-glasses. The database consists of a generic dataset of 12,776 images for training a generic face subspace, a target set of 16,028 images and a query set of 8,014 images are given for matching. We propose to use our novel face recognition algorithm using Kernel Correlation Feature Analysis for dimensionality reduction (222 features) coupled with Support Vector Machine discriminative training in the Target KCFA feature set for providing a similarity distance measure of the probe to each target subject. We show that this algorithm configuration yields the best verification rate at 0.1% FAR (87.5%) compared to PCA+SVM, GSLDA+SVM, SVM+SVM, KDA+SVM. Thus we explore with our proposed algorithm which facial regions provide the best discrimination ability, we analyze performing partial face recognition using the eye-region, nose region and mouth region. We empirically find that the eye-region is the most discriminative feature of the faces in FRGC data and yields a verification rate closest to the holistic face recognition of 83.5% @ 0.1% FAR compared to 87.5%. We use Support Vector Machines for fusing these two to boost the performance to ~90@0.1 % FAR on the first large-scale face database such as the FRGC dataset.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2006.153","publicationTitle":"2006 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop (CVPRW'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop (CVPRW'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10922/34371/01640488.pdf","startPage":"48","endPage":"48","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2006.153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34371","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial & Holistic Face Recognition on FRGC-II data using Support Vector Machine","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640488","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640488/","displayDocTitle":"Partial & Holistic Face Recognition on FRGC-II data using Support Vector Machine","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1640488/","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial & Holistic Face Recognition on FRGC-II data using Support Vector Machine","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640488.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053434S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10922","isNumber":"34371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10922","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"34371","articleId":"1640488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1640489,"authors":[{"name":"Sung Won Park","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Sung Won Park","id":"37539543400"},{"name":"M.

We use higher-order tensors to model multiple factors of facial variations, but this provides some difficulty in use. First, it is difficult to decompose the multiple factors of a test image, especially when the factor parameters are unknown or are not in the training set. Second, for face recognition and face synthesis tasks, it is also difficult to construct reliable multilinear models which have more than two factors. In this paper, we propose a novel tensor factorization method to decompose mixing factors for unseen test images. We set up tensor factorization problem as a least squares problems with a quadratic equality constraint, and solve it using numerical optimization techniques. The novelty in our approach compared to previous work is that our tensor factorization method does not require any knowledge or assumption of test images; we can attain parameters of facial factors by our tensor factorization method. We have conducted several experiments to show the versatility of the method for both face recognition and synthesis tasks. Thus, we demonstrate the proposed method produces reliable results for trilinear models as well as bilinear models.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2006.73","publicationTitle":"2006 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop (CVPRW'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop (CVPRW'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10922/34371/01640489.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2006.73","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34371","startPage":"49","endPage":"49","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimating Mixing Factors Simultaneously in Multilinear Tensor Decomposition for Robust Face Recognition and Synthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640489","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Estimating Mixing Factors Simultaneously in Multilinear Tensor Decomposition for Robust Face Recognition and Synthesis","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640489/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1640489/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating Mixing Factors Simultaneously in Multilinear Tensor Decomposition for Robust Face Recognition and Synthesis","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640489.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060515S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10922","isNumber":"34371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10922","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"34371","articleId":"1640489","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1640493,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The motivation behind this effort is to capitalize on the permanency of innate characteristics that are under the skin. To establish feasibility, we propose a specific methodology to capture facial physiological patterns using the bioheat information contained in thermal imagery. First, the algorithm delineates the human face from the background using the Bayesian framework. Then, it localizes the superficial blood vessel network using image morphology. The extracted vascular network produces contour shapes that are characteristic to each individual. The branching points of the skeletonized vascular network are referred to as Thermal Minutia Points (TMP) and constitute the feature database. To render the method robust to facial pose variations we collect for each subject to be stored in the database five (5) different pose images (center, mid-left profile, left profile, mid-right profile, and right profile). During the classification stage, the algorithm first estimates the pose of the test image. Then, it matches the local and global TMP structures extracted from the test image with those of the corresponding pose images in the database. We have conducted experiments on a sizeable database of thermal facial images collected in our lab. The good experimental results show that the proposed methodology has merit. More important, the results demonstrate the feasibility of the physiological framework in face recognition and open the way for further methodological and experimental research in the area.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pose-Invariant Physiological Face Recognition in the Thermal Infrared Spectrum","publicationTitle":"2006 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop (CVPRW'06)","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2006.160","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop (CVPRW'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10922/34371/01640493.pdf","startPage":"53","endPage":"53","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2006.160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34371","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640493","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640493/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Pose-Invariant Physiological Face Recognition in the Thermal Infrared Spectrum","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1640493/","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pose-Invariant Physiological Face Recognition in the Thermal Infrared Spectrum","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640493.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057736S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10922","isNumber":"34371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10922","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"34371","articleId":"1640493","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1640545,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The system was synthesized onto a Xilinx Virtex-II Pro XC2VP30 FPGA utilizing less than 25% of system resources, performing with a maximum operating frequency of 67MHz without pipelining, and consuming 497mW of power.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2006.92","publicationTitle":"2006 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop (CVPRW'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop (CVPRW'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10922/34371/01640567.pdf","startPage":"123","endPage":"123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2006.92","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34371","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640567","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware/Software Co-Design of an FPGA-based Embedded Tracking System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640567/","displayDocTitle":"Hardware/Software Co-Design of an FPGA-based Embedded Tracking System","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1640567/","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware/Software Co-Design of an FPGA-based Embedded Tracking System","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640567.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054067S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10922","isNumber":"34371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10922","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"34371","articleId":"1640567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1640568,"authors":[{"name":"G. van der Wal","affiliation":["Embedded Vision Systems, Sarnoff Corporation, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"G.","lastName":"van der Wal","id":"37449310500"},{"name":"F.

As a result, a variety of methods have been devised to decrease the risk when creating an ASIC or SoC. We describe a hardware and software framework for testing real-time vision algorithms for lowering the uncertainty in FPGA and SoC development, while reducing the SoC verification time.

We have met our goal with the Tyzx DeepSea G2 Stereo Vision System, an embedded stereo camera consisting of two CMOS imagers, a DeepSea II stereo ASIC, an FPGA, a DSP/Co-processor and a PowerPC running Linux, connected to the Ethernet. It is made practically taskable by the definition of a set of configurable visual primitives supported by specific hardware acceleration. These primitives include stereo correlation, color and depth background modeling, and 2D and 3D quantized representations or projections of the range data. We have defined a common programming interface in which the visual primitives are available both in traditional workstation environments, supported in software, and on the G2 with hardware acceleration.

Spectral screening is a technique used in reducing the multispectral / hyperspectral data to a representative subset of spectra. The subset is formed such that any two spectra in it are dissimilar and, for any spectrum in the original image cube, there is a similar spectrum in the subset. Spectral screening is performed in a sequential manner, at each step, the subset being increased with a spectrum dissimilar from all the spectra already selected. The procedure, using the spectral angle as similarity measure is employed in a variety of algorithms for linear unmixing and data compression. We modified the algorithm such that at the selection step the spectrum with the largest distance from the set is selected. While not introducing additional computational complexity, the Maximum Spectral Screening (MSS) algorithm ensures that the overlap among the representatives is minimized. MSS is further improved by choosing as first spectra the one with the largest distance to the diagonal, thus transforming the screening into a deterministic process. Second, we investigated the alternative approach where at each step the spectra with the smallest distance (but larger than a threshold value) is selected (Minimum Spectral Screening mSS). The detection filters were obtained as the classification projector matrices based on the spectral subset. The developed algorithms were tested on HYDICE hyperspectral data using the spectral angle and the spectral information divergence. The results indicate that MSS outperforms regular spectral screening detection and mSS.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2006.10","publicationTitle":"2006 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop (CVPRW'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop (CVPRW'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10922/34371/01640577.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2006.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34371","startPage":"132","endPage":"132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Class of Detection Filters for Targets and Anomalies in Multispectral / Hyperspectral Imagery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640577","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Class of Detection Filters for Targets and Anomalies in Multispectral / Hyperspectral Imagery","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640577/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1640577/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Class of Detection Filters for Targets and Anomalies in Multispectral / Hyperspectral Imagery","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640577.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055351S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10922","isNumber":"34371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10922","xplore-issue":"34371","articleId":"1640577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1640595,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We analyse subtle changes in facial expression by recognizing facial muscle action units (AUs) and analysing their temporal behavior. By detecting AUs from face video we enable the analysis of various facial communicative signals including facial expressions of emotion, attitude and mood. For an input video picturing a facial expression we detect per frame whether any of 15 different AUs is activated, whether that facial action is in the onset, apex, or offset phase, and what the total duration of the activation in question is. We base this process upon a set of spatio-temporal features calculated from tracking data for 20 facial fiducial points. To detect these 20 points of interest in the first frame of an input face video, we utilize a fully automatic, facial point localization method that uses individual feature GentleBoost templates built from Gabor wavelet features. Then, we exploit a particle filtering scheme that uses factorized likelihoods and a novel observation model that combines a rigid and a morphological model to track the facial points. The AUs displayed in the input video and their temporal segments are recognized finally by Support Vector Machines trained on a subset of most informative spatio-temporal features selected by AdaBoost. For Cohn-Kanade andMMI databases, the proposed system classifies 15 AUs occurring alone or in combination with other AUs with a mean agreement rate of 90.2% with human FACS coders.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10922/34371/01640595.pdf","startPage":"149","endPage":"149","publicationTitle":"2006 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop (CVPRW'06)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2006.85","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2006.85","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop (CVPRW'06)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640595","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face detection","Face recognition","Robustness","Facial muscles","Signal analysis","Mood","Phase detection","Gabor filters","Filtering","Particle tracking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640595/","displayDocTitle":"Fully Automatic Facial Action Unit Detection and Temporal Analysis","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","publicationDate":"2006","htmlLink":"/document/1640595/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fully Automatic Facial Action Unit Detection and Temporal Analysis","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640595.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055671S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10922","isNumber":"34371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10922","citationCount":"149","xplore-issue":"34371","articleId":"1640595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":1640608,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This, among other things, creates ample opportunities for the sharing of video sequences. In order to protect the privacy of subjects visible in the scene, automated methods to de-identify the images, particularly the face region, are necessary. So far the majority of privacy protection schemes currently used in practice rely on ad-hoc methods such as pixelation or blurring of the face. In this paper we show in extensive experiments that pixelation and blurring offers very poor privacy protection while significantly distorting the data. We then introduce a novel framework for de-identifying facial images. Our algorithm combines a model-based face image parameterization with a formal privacy protection model. In experiments on two large-scale data sets we demonstrate privacy protection and preservation of data utility.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protection","Data privacy","Cameras","Video sharing","Layout","Biomedical monitoring","Biomedical imaging","Senior citizens","Computer science","Robots"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2006.125","publicationTitle":"2006 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop (CVPRW'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop (CVPRW'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10922/34371/01640608.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2006.125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-Based Face De-Identification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640608","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Model-Based Face De-Identification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640608/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1640608/","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-Based Face De-Identification","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640608.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067182S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10922","isNumber":"34371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10922","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"34371","articleId":"1640608","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":1640609,"authors":[{"name":"P.

For example, unauthorized access or regeneration of face templates has serious implications on the privacy of the concerned users. For robust and practical implementation of such system it is necessary to identify and explore the possible ways by which reconstruction of template is feasible. In this paper, we show that even match scores carries sufficient information for reconstruction of the original face templates. We propose a novel non-iterative scheme to reconstruct face templates from match scores. We use an affine transformation of the images to approximate the behavior of a given face recognition system using an independent set of face templates termed as \"break-in\" set. Selected templates from the break-in set are matched only once with the enrolled template of the target account and match scores are recorded. These scores are then embedded in the approximating affine space along with break-in set templates to compute the co-ordinates of the target template. The inverse transformation is used to reconstruct the original target template. We present the reconstruction of templates for a commercial off the shelf (COTS) face recognition system. The COTS system is set to operate at 1% False Acceptance Rate and 99% True Acceptance Rate with 100 enrollments. We observed that with proposed scheme, at most 450 attempts are required to achieve a 0.93 probability of break into the COTS face recognition system by choosing a random gallery target.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2006.163","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2006.163","startPage":"162","endPage":"162","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop (CVPRW'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10922/34371/01640609.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop (CVPRW'06)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34371","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Privacy & Security Issues Related to Match Scores","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Privacy & Security Issues Related to Match Scores","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1640609/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640609/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy & Security Issues Related to Match Scores","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640609.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044549S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10922","isNumber":"34371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10922","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"34371","articleId":"1640609","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1640610,"authors":[{"name":"U.

What happens if the biometric template is lost or stolen? Can the privacy of the users be preserved even when a security breach occurs? Among the numerous attacks that can be launched against these systems, protecting the user template that is stored either locally (e.g., on a smart card) or centrally (e.g., on the server) is a major concern. As a possible solution to this problem, a new class of algorithms, termed biometric cryptosystems has been proposed. These systems do not store the original template but only a transformed version of the template within a cryptographic framework. An example of such systems is the fuzzy vault construct proposed by Juels and Sudan. In this construct, the biometric template is converted to a 2D point cloud, containing a secret such as a symmetric encryption key. The operation of the vault requires some \"helper\" data. In this paper, we present an implementation of the fuzzy fingerprint vault based on orientation field based helper data that is automatically extracted from the fingerprints. We further show that this helper data does not leak any information about fingerprint minutiae, hence complementing the increased user privacy afforded by the fuzzy fingerprint vault. We demonstrate the vault performance on a public domain fingerprint database.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop (CVPRW'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10922/34371/01640610.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"163","publicationTitle":"2006 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop (CVPRW'06)","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2006.185","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2006.185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34371","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640610","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Securing Fingerprint Template: Fuzzy Vault with Helper Data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fingerprint recognition","Biometrics","Cryptography","Data security","Privacy","Robustness","Protection","Smart cards","Fuzzy systems","Clouds"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640610/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Securing Fingerprint Template: Fuzzy Vault with Helper Data","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1640610/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Securing Fingerprint Template: Fuzzy Vault with Helper Data","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640610.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068017S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10922","isNumber":"34371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10922","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"34371","articleId":"1640610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1640618,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Hence, the 3D image space is directly sampled at a video-rate with single camera. Captured images are rendered on a transparent multi-layer display. Thus, a truly volumetric image is observed without eyeglasses. Combination rendering of these natural scenes with 3D computer-graphic (CG) objects creates a realistic Synthesized & Natural Hybrid scene at a reasonable cost.

Besides having important applications to edge detection and grouping the curve finding task is a special case of a more general problem, where we want to explain the whole image in terms of a small set of objects. We describe a novel approach for estimating the content of scenes with multiple objects using a min-cover framework that is simple and powerful. The min-cover problem is NP-hard but there is a good approximation algorithm that sequentially selects objects minimizing a \"cost per pixel\" measure. In the case of curve detection we use a type of best-first search to quickly find good curves for the covering algorithm. The method integrates image data over long curves without relying on binary feature detection. We have applied the curve detection method for finding object boundaries in natural scenes and measured its performance using the Berkeley segmentation dataset.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640633/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1640633/","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"A Min-Cover Approach for Finding Salient Curves","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Min-Cover Approach for Finding Salient Curves","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640633.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052241S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10922","isNumber":"34371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10922","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"34371","articleId":"1640633","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1640642,"authors":[{"name":"B.

A novel hierarchical representation allows to represent individual images as well as various objects classes in a single, scale and rotation invariant model. The recognition method is based on a codebook representation where appearance clusters built from edge based features are shared among several object classes. A probabilistic model allows for reliable detection of various objects in the same image. The approach is highly efficient due to fast clustering and matching methods capable of dealing with millions of high dimensional features. The system shows excellent performance on several object categories over a wide range of scales, in-plane rotations, background clutter, and partial occlusions. The performance of the proposed multi-object class detection approach is competitive to state of the art approaches dedicated to a single object class recognition problem.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.202","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34373/01640738.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.202","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","startPage":"26","endPage":"36","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple Object Class Detection with a Generative Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640738","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Object Class Detection with a Generative Model","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640738/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1640738/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Object Class Detection with a Generative Model","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640738.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06218S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"34373","articleId":"1640738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1640739,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The most famous and used formulation of LDA is that given by the Fisher-Rao criterion, where the problem reduces to a simple simultaneous diagonalization of two symmetric, positive-definite matrices, A and B; i.e. B^-1 AV = VA. Here, A defines the metric to be maximized, while B defines the metric to be minimized. However, when B has near-zero eigenvalues, the Fisher-Rao criterion gets dominated by these. While this works well when such small variances describe vectors where most of the discriminant information is, the results will be incorrect when these small variances are caused by noise. Knowing which of these near-zero values are to be used and which need to be eliminated is a challenging yet fundamental task in LDA. This paper presents a criterion for the selection of those vectors of B that are best for classification. The proposed solution is based on a simple factorization of B^-1 A that permits the re-ordering of the eigenvectors of B without the need to effect the end result. This allows us to readily eliminate the noisy vectors while keeping the most discriminant ones. A theoretical basis for these results is presented along with extensive experimental results to validate the claims.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.271","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34373/01640751.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.271","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34373","startPage":"132","endPage":"137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selecting Principal Components in a Two-Stage LDA Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640751","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Selecting Principal Components in a Two-Stage LDA Algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640751/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1640751/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selecting Principal Components in a Two-Stage LDA Algorithm","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640751.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05819S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"34373","articleId":"1640751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1640756,"authors":[{"name":"Shuicheng Yan","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","Beckman Institute, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"lastName":"Shuicheng Yan","id":"37272225300"},{"name":"Tianqiang Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Tianqiang Yuan","id":"37566503600"},{"name":"Xiaoou Tang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Xiaoou Tang","id":"37280008500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2597-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"1640756","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Sparse matrices","Principal component analysis","Linear discriminant analysis","Tensile stress","Image reconstruction","Asia","Humans","Eyes","Mouth"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.173","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34373/01640756.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.173","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Semantic Patterns with Discriminant Localized Binary Projections","abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel approach to learning semantic localized patterns with binary projections in a supervised manner. The pursuit of these binary projections is reformulated into a problem of feature clustering, which optimizes the separability of different classes by taking the members within each cluster as the nonzero entries of a projection vector. An efficient greedy procedure is proposed to incrementally combine the sub-clusters by ensuring the cardinality constraints of the projections and the increase of the objective function. Compared with other algorithms for sparse representations, our proposed algorithm, referred to as Discriminant Localized Binary Projections (dlb), has the following characteristics: 1) dlb is supervised, hence is much more effective than other unsupervised sparse algorithms like Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) in terms of classification power; 2) similar to NMF, dlb can derive spatially localized sparse bases; furthermore, the sparsity of dlb is controllable, and an interesting result is that the bases have explicit semantics in human perception, like eyes and mouth; and 3) classification with dlb is extremely efficient, and only addition operations are required for dimensionality reduction. Extensive experimental results show significant improvements of dlb in sparsity and face recognition accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms for dimensionality reduction and sparse representations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640756/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","publicationDate":"2006","htmlLink":"/document/1640756/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Learning Semantic Patterns with Discriminant Localized Binary Projections","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Semantic Patterns with Discriminant Localized Binary Projections","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640756.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069991S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"34373","articleId":"1640756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1640757,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, USA","MOE-Microsoft Key Laboratory of Multimedia Computing and Communication & Department of EEIS, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"lastName":"Dong Xu","id":"37291414100"},{"name":"S.

To handle tensor data, this approach has been formulated with tight restrictions on projection directions that, along with convergence issues and the assumption of Gaussian distributed class data, limits its face recognition performance. To overcome these problems, we propose a method of rank-one projections with adaptive margins (RPAM) that gives a provably convergent solution for tensor data over a more general class of projections, while accounting for margins between samples of different classes. In contrast to previous margin based works which determine margin sample pairs within the original high dimensional space, RPAM instead aims to maximize the margins defined in the expected lower dimensional feature subspace by progressive margin refinement after each rank-one projection. In addition to handling tensor data, vector-based variants of RPAM are presented for linear mappings and for nonlinear mappings using kernel tricks. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that RPAM brings significant improvement in face recognition over previous subspace learning techniques.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.234","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34373/01640757.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34373","startPage":"175","endPage":"181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rank-one Projections with Adaptive Margins for Face Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640757","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Rank-one Projections with Adaptive Margins for Face Recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640757/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1640757/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rank-one Projections with Adaptive Margins for Face Recognition","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640757.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072296S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","xplore-issue":"34373","articleId":"1640757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1640761,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Alternatively, one could fit a model such that, when the model is run on the training images, it finds the parts. We do this by maximizing the conditional likelihood of the training data. We formulate model-learning as parameter estimation in a conditional random field (CRF). Initializing parameters with their maximum likelihood estimates, we reach the global optimum by gradient ascent. We present a learning algorithm that searches exhaustively over all part locations in an image without relying on feature detectors. This provides millions of examples of training data, and seems to avoid over-fitting issues known with CRFs. Results for part localization are relatively scarce in the community. We present results on three established datasets; Caltech motorbikes [8], USC people [19], and Weizmann horses [3]. In the Caltech set we significantly outperform the state-of-the-art [6]. For the challenging people dataset, we present results that are comparable to [19], but are obtained using a significantly more generic model (devoid of a face or skin detector). Our model is general enough to find other articulated objects; we use it to recover poses of horses in the challenging Weizmann database.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34373/01640761.pdf","startPage":"206","endPage":"213","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34373","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training Deformable Models for Localization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deformable models","Training data","Detectors","Horses","Face detection","Parameter estimation","Maximum likelihood detection","Maximum likelihood estimation","Computer vision","Motorcycles"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640761/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Training Deformable Models for Localization","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1640761/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training Deformable Models for Localization","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640761.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066864S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"34373","articleId":"1640761","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1640765,"authors":[{"name":"R.

As a result, the diffusion distance is derived as the sum of dissimilarities over scales. Being a cross-bin histogram distance, the diffusion distance is robust to deformation, lighting change and noise in histogram-based local descriptors. In addition, it enjoys linear computational complexity which significantly improves previously proposed cross-bin distances with quadratic complexity or higher. We tested the proposed approach on both shape recognition and interest point matching tasks using several multi-dimensional histogram-based descriptors including shape context, SIFT, and spin images. In all experiments, the diffusion distance performs excellently in both accuracy and efficiency in comparison with other state-of-the-art distance measures.

Mainly off-line training methods have been used, which implies that all training data has to be a priori given; training and usage of the classifier are separate steps. Training the classifier on-line and incrementally as new data becomes available has several advantages and opens new areas of application for boosting in computer vision. In this paper we propose a novel on-line AdaBoost feature selection method. In conjunction with efficient feature extraction methods the method is real time capable. We demonstrate the multifariousness of the method on such diverse tasks as learning complex background models, visual tracking and object detection.

A rich set of distance metrics, such as harmonic distance and geometric distance, is derived according to Maximum Likelihood theory. These metrics can provide a more accurate feature model than the conventional Euclidean distance (SSD) and Manhattan distance (SAD). Because the feature elements are from heterogeneous sources and may have different influence on similarity estimation, the assumption of single isotropic distribution model is often inappropriate. We propose a novel boosted distance metric that not only finds the best distance metric that fits the distribution of the underlying elements but also selects the most important feature elements with respect to similarity. We experiment with different distance metrics for similarity estimation and compute the accuracy of different methods in two applications: stereo matching and motion tracking in video sequences. The boosted distance metric is tested on fifteen benchmark data sets from the UCI repository and two image retrieval applications. In all the experiments, robust results are obtained based on the proposed methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Guidelines","Maximum likelihood estimation","Euclidean distance","Motion estimation","Tracking","Video sequences","Benchmark testing","Information retrieval","Image retrieval"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.310","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34373/01640775.pdf","startPage":"316","endPage":"322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward Robust Distance Metric Analysis for Similarity Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640775","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Toward Robust Distance Metric Analysis for Similarity Estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640775/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1640775/","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward Robust Distance Metric Analysis for Similarity Estimation","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640775.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097413S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"34373","articleId":"1640775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":1640778,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The camera consists of an image detector and a special aperture, but no lens. The aperture is a set of parallel light attenuating layers whose transmittances are controllable in space and time. By applying different transmittance patterns to this aperture, it is possible to modulate the incoming light in useful ways and capture images that are impossible to capture with conventional lens-based cameras. For example, the camera can pan and tilt its field of view without the use of any moving parts. It can also capture disjoint regions of interest in the scene without having to capture the regions in between them. In addition, the camera can be used as a computational sensor, where the detector measures the end result of computations performed by the attenuating layers on the scene radiance values. These and other imaging functionalities can be implemented with the same physical camera and the functionalities can be switched from one video frame to the next via software. We have built a prototype camera based on this approach using a bare image detector and a liquid crystal modulator for the aperture. We discuss in detail the merits and limitations of lensless imaging using controllable apertures.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.175","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34373/01640778.pdf","startPage":"339","endPage":"346","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lensless Imaging with a Controllable Aperture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Lensless Imaging with a Controllable Aperture","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1640778/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640778/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2006","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lensless Imaging with a Controllable Aperture","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640778.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058236S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"34373","articleId":"1640778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1640779,"authors":[{"name":"Jingdong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, HKUST, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Jingdong Wang","id":"37406478900"},{"name":"Long Quan","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Long Quan","id":"37273384400"},{"name":"Jian Sun","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, HKUST, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Jian Sun","id":"37407525400"},{"name":"Xiaoou Tang","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xiaoou Tang","id":"37280008500"},{"name":"Heung-Yeung Shum","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Heung-Yeung Shum","id":"37275914300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2597-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"1640779","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":544},"abstract":"In this paper, we address a novel problem of automatically creating a picture collage from a group of images.

We formulate the picture collage creation problem in a Bayesian framework. The salient regions of each image are firstly extracted and represented as a set of weighted rectangles. Then, the image arrangement is formulated as a Maximum a Posterior (MAP) problem such that the output picture collage shows as many visible salient regions (without being overlaid by others) from all images as possible. Moreover, a very efficientMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is designed for the optimization. Applications to desktop image browsing and image search result summarization demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34373/01640779.pdf","startPage":"347","endPage":"354","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34373","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640779","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Picture Collage","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640779/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Picture Collage","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1640779/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Picture Collage","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640779.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04682S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"34373","articleId":"1640779","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1640781,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Robust estimates of the camera motion are computed in real-time, key-frames are selected and permit the features 3D reconstruction. The algorithm is particularly appropriate to the reconstruction of long images sequences thanks to the introduction of a fast and local bundle adjustment method that ensures both good accuracy and consistency of the estimated camera poses along the sequence. It also largely reduces computational complexity compared to a global bundle adjustment. Experiments on real data were carried out to evaluate speed and robustness of the method for a sequence of about one kilometer long.

The model takes into account anthropometric evidences collected on facial growth and hence is in accordance with the observed growth patterns in human faces across years. We characterize facial growth by means of growth parameters defined over facial landmarks often used in anthropometric studies. We illustrate how the age-based anthropometric constraints on facial proportions translate into linear and non-linear constraints on facial growth parameters and propose methods to compute the optimal growth parameters. The proposed craniofacial growth model can be used to predict one\u2019s appearance across years and to perform face recognition across age progression.

This paper describes an unsupervised data driven Bayesian clustering algorithm which has detection of individual entities as its primary goal. We track simple image features and probabilistically group them into clusters representing independently moving entities. The numbers of clusters and the grouping of constituent features are determined without supervised learning or any subject-specific model. The new approach is instead, that space-time proximity and trajectory coherence through image space are used as the only probabilistic criteria for clustering. An important contribution of this work is how these criteria are used to perform a one-shot data association without iterating through combinatorial hypotheses of cluster assignments. Our proposed general detection algorithm can be augmented with subject-specific filtering, but is shown to already be effective at detecting individual entities in crowds of people, insects, and animals. This paper and the associated video examine the implementation and experiments of our motion clustering framework.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.320","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34373/01640809.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34373","startPage":"594","endPage":"601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised Bayesian Detection of Independent Motion in Crowds","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640809","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised Bayesian Detection of Independent Motion in Crowds","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640809/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1640809/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised Bayesian Detection of Independent Motion in Crowds","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640809.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078676S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"226","xplore-issue":"34373","articleId":"1640809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":1640814,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Yan","affiliation":["Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, UK"],"lastName":"Fei Yan","id":"37402516300"},{"name":"A.

However, in the presence of successive misdetections, a large number of false candidates and an unknown number of abrupt model switchings that happen unpredictably, the data association problem can be very difficult. We tackle these difficulties by using a layered data association scheme. At the object level, trajectories are \"grown\" from sets of object candidates that have high probabilities of containing only true positives; by this means the otherwise combinatorial complexity is significantly reduced. Dijkstra\u2019s shortest path algorithm is then used to perform data association at the trajectory level. The algorithm is applied to low-quality tennis video sequences to track a tennis ball. Experiments show that the algorithm is robust to abrupt model switchings, and performs well in heavily cluttered environments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Data Association Algorithm for Object Tracking in Clutter with Application to Tennis Video Analysis","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.36","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34373/01640814.pdf","startPage":"634","endPage":"641","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34373","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640814","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640814/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Data Association Algorithm for Object Tracking in Clutter with Application to Tennis Video Analysis","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1640814/","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Data Association Algorithm for Object Tracking in Clutter with Application to Tennis Video Analysis","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640814.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074028S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"34373","articleId":"1640814","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1640818,"authors":[{"name":"A.G.A.

This is difficult when the objects are often occluded for long periods: nearly all tracking algorithms will terminate a track with loss of identity on a long gap. The problem is further confounded by objects in close proximity, tracking failures due to shadows, etc. Recently, some work has been done to address these issues using higher level reasoning, by linking tracks from multiple objects over long gaps. However, these efforts have assumed a one-to-one correspondence between tracks on either side of the gap. This is often not true in real scenarios of interest, where the objects are closely spaced and dynamically occlude each other, causing trackers to merge objects into single tracks. In this paper, we show how to efficiently handle splitting and merging during track linking. Moreover, we show that we can maintain the identities of objects that merge together and subsequently split.

The boundary-based component looks for the path bounding lines assuming a geometric model of a planar pathway bounded by parallel edges taken by a perspective camera.

The difficulty of these tasks increases considerably with occlusions and therefore with crowding. When the objects are constrained to be of the same kind, however, partitioning of densely crowded semi-rigid objects can be accomplished by means of clustering tracked feature points. We base our approach on a highly parallelized version of the KLT tracker in order to process the video into a set of feature trajectories. While such a set of trajectories provides a substrate for motion analysis, their unequal lengths and fragmented nature present difficulties for subsequent processing. To address this, we propose a simple means of spatially and temporally conditioning the trajectories. Given this representation, we integrate it with a learned object descriptor to achieve a segmentation of the constituent motions. We present experimental results for the problem of estimating the number of moving objects in a dense crowd as a function of time.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.92","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34373/01640823.pdf","startPage":"705","endPage":"711","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.92","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Counting Crowded Moving Objects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640823/","displayDocTitle":"Counting Crowded Moving Objects","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1640823/","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Counting Crowded Moving Objects","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640823.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112735S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"223","xplore-issue":"34373","articleId":"1640823","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":1640826,"authors":[{"name":"F.

We incorporated a model update algorithm using the Lie group structure of the positive definite matrices. The update mechanism effectively adapts to the undergoing object deformations and appearance changes. The covariance tracking method does not make any assumption on the measurement noise and the motion of the tracked objects, and provides the global optimal solution.

The template object is represented by multiple image fragments or patches. The patches are arbitrary and are not based on an object model (in contrast with traditional use of modelbased parts e.g. limbs and torso in human tracking). Every patch votes on the possible positions and scales of the object in the current frame, by comparing its histogram with the corresponding image patch histogram. We then minimize a robust statistic in order to combine the vote maps of the multiple patches. A key tool enabling the application of our algorithm to tracking is the integral histogram data structure [18]. Its use allows to extract histograms of multiple rectangular regions in the image in a very efficient manner. Our algorithm overcomes several difficulties which cannot be handled by traditional histogram-based algorithms [8, 6]. First, by robustly combining multiple patch votes, we are able to handle partial occlusions or pose change. Second, the geometric relations between the template patches allow us to take into account the spatial distribution of the pixel intensities - information which is lost in traditional histogram-based algorithms. Third, as noted by [18], tracking large targets has the same computational cost as tracking small targets. We present extensive experimental results on challenging sequences, which demonstrate the robust tracking achieved by our algorithm (even with the use of only gray-scale (noncolor) information).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640835/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","publicationDate":"2006","htmlLink":"/document/1640835/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robust Fragments-based Tracking using the Integral Histogram","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Fragments-based Tracking using the Integral Histogram","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640835.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051357S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"828","xplore-issue":"34373","articleId":"1640835","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":1640848,"authors":[{"name":"Ce Liu","affiliation":["CS and AI Laboratory, MIT, USA"],"lastName":"Ce Liu","id":"37087144888"},{"name":"W.T.

The responses of the body part detectors and a combined human detector provide the \"observations\" used for tracking. Trajectory initialization and termination are both fully automatic and rely on the confidences computed from the detection responses. An object is tracked by data association if its corresponding detection response can be found; otherwise it is tracked by a meanshift style tracker. Our method can track humans with both inter-object and scene occlusions. The system is evaluated on three sets of videos and compared with previous method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking of Multiple, Partially Occluded Humans based on Static Body Part Detection","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.312","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34373/01640854.pdf","startPage":"951","endPage":"958","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34373","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640854","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640854/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Tracking of Multiple, Partially Occluded Humans based on Static Body Part Detection","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1640854/","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking of Multiple, Partially Occluded Humans based on Static Body Part Detection","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640854.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051064S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"34373","articleId":"1640854","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1640855,"authors":[{"name":"A.

An action is an individual atomic unit of an activity. Different instances of the same activity may consist of varying relative speeds at which the various actions are executed, in addition to other intra- and inter- person variabilities. Most existing algorithms for activity recognition are not very robust to intra- and inter-personal changes of the same activity, and are extremely sensitive to warping of the temporal axis due to variations in speed profile. In this paper, we provide a systematic approach to learn the nature of such time warps while simultaneously allowing for the variations in descriptors for actions. For each activity we learn an \u2018average\u2019 sequence that we denote as the nominal activity trajectory. We also learn a function space of time warpings for each activity separately. The model can be used to learn individualspecific warping patterns so that it may also be used for activity based person identification. The proposed model leads us to algorithms for learning a model for each activity, clustering activity sequences and activity recognition that are robust to temporal, intra- and inter-person variations. We provide experimental results using two datasets.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.304","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34373/01640855.pdf","startPage":"959","endPage":"968","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.304","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Function Space of an Activity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","displayDocTitle":"The Function Space of an Activity","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1640855/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640855/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Function Space of an Activity","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640855.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046155S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"34373","articleId":"1640855","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1640859,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This energy has not been proposed previously and its optimization is challenging and NP-hard. For this problem a novel optimization scheme which we call trust region graph cuts is presented. We demonstrate that this framework has the potential to improve a wide range of research: Object driven image retrieval, video tracking and segmentation, and interactive image editing.

More recently [11], a Markov Random Field (MRF) prior has been used to model consistencies among neighbouring foreground/background labels. Graph Cut methods have been used to find the maximum of the resulting posterior distribution for the labels for each frame. However, for increased efficiency and accuracy, we propose the use of loopy belief propagation. A major reason for increased efficiency is the fact that the output labels from the previous frame can be used as initialisation for the current frame in belief propagation. The Graph Cuts approach is empirically compared with both the \"sumproduct\" as well as \"max-product\" rules of belief propagation on real video sequences. Significantly, while the \"max-product\" rule has similar peak precision-recall performance as graph-cuts, the \"sum-product\" rule gives even better peak performance. This can be attributed to the fact that latter rule finds the marginals over the entire posterior distribution for the labels rather than just the maximum of the posterior which is more prone to noise.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.80","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34373/01640880.pdf","startPage":"1154","endPage":"1159","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.80","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparing Belief Propagation and Graph Cuts for Novelty Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Comparing Belief Propagation and Graph Cuts for Novelty Detection","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1640880/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640880/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing Belief Propagation and Graph Cuts for Novelty Detection","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640880.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04674S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"34373","articleId":"1640880","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":1640885,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Our method exploits the fact that it is often a reasonable assumption that some of the points are deforming throughout the sequence while others remain rigid. First we use an automatic segmentation algorithm to identify the set of rigid points which in turn is used to estimate the internal camera calibration parameters and the overall rigid motion. Finally we formalise the problem of non-rigid shape estimation as a constrained non-linear minimization adding priors on the degree of deformability of each point. We perform experiments on synthetic and real data which show firstly that even when using a minimal set of rigid points it is possible to obtain reliable metric information and secondly that the shape priors help to disambiguate the contribution to the image motion caused by the deformation and the perspective distortion.","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34373/01640885.pdf","startPage":"1191","endPage":"1198","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Rigid Metric Shape and Motion Recovery from Uncalibrated Images Using Priors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640885/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Non-Rigid Metric Shape and Motion Recovery from Uncalibrated Images Using Priors","htmlLink":"/document/1640885/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Rigid Metric Shape and Motion Recovery from Uncalibrated Images Using Priors","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640885.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054233S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"34373","articleId":"1640885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1640915,"authors":[{"name":"Dahua Lin","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Dahua Lin","id":"37416122100"},{"name":"Xiaoou Tang","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xiaoou Tang","id":"37280008500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2597-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"1640915","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":295},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Skin","Microscopy","Nonhomogeneous media","Principal component analysis","Humans","Linear discriminant analysis","Eyes","Nose","Mouth"]}],"abstract":"Human faces manifest distinct structures and characteristics when observed in different scales. Traditional face recognition techniques mainly rely on low-resolution face images, leading to the lost of significant information contained in the microscopic traits. In this paper, we introduce a multilayer framework for high resolution face recognition exploiting features in multiple scales. Each face image is factorized into four layers: global appearance, facial organs, skins, and irregular details. We employ Multilevel PCA followed by Regularized LDA to model global appearance and facial organs. However, the description of skin texture and irregular details, for which conventional vector representation are not suitable, brings forth the need of developing novel representations. To address the issue, Discriminative Multiscale Texton Features and SIFT-Activated Pictorial Structure are proposed to describe skin and subtle details respectively. To effectively combine the information conveyed by all layers, we further design an metric fusion algorithm adaptively placing emphasis onto the highly confident layers. Through systematic experiments, we identify different roles played by the layers and convincingly show that by utilizing their complementarities, our framework achieves remarkable performance improvement.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.243","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34374/01640915.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.243","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","startPage":"1355","endPage":"1362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognize High Resolution Faces: From Macrocosm to Microcosm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640915","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","displayDocTitle":"Recognize High Resolution Faces: From Macrocosm to Microcosm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640915/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1640915/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2006","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognize High Resolution Faces: From Macrocosm to Microcosm","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640915.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093858S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"34374","articleId":"1640915","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1640917,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Yang Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"lastName":"Wei-Yang Lin","id":"37420979700"},{"name":"Kin-Chung Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"lastName":"Kin-Chung Wong","id":"38253839600"},{"name":"N.

We apply a hierarchical distance-based clustering procedure according to some distance measure on the appearance manifold to cluster similar face images together. Based on the local models extracted, we then construct the intrapersonal and extrapersonal subspaces. Given a new test image, the angle between the projections of the image onto the two subspaces is used as a distance measure for classification. Since a test example contains multiple face images in multiple-shot face recognition, the final classification combines the classification decisions of all individual test images via a majority voting scheme. We compare our method empirically with some previous methods based on a database of video sequences of human faces, showing that out method significantly outperforms other methods.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.178","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34374/01640919.pdf","startPage":"1384","endPage":"1390","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Locally Linear Models on Face Appearance Manifolds with Application to Dual-Subspace Based Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640919/","displayDocTitle":"Locally Linear Models on Face Appearance Manifolds with Application to Dual-Subspace Based Classification","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1640919/","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Locally Linear Models on Face Appearance Manifolds with Application to Dual-Subspace Based Classification","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640919.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051467S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"34374","articleId":"1640919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1640920,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In this paper, we investigate the importance and usefulness of 3D facial geometric shapes to represent and recognize facial expressions using 3D facial expression range data. We propose a novel approach to extract primitive 3D facial expression features, and then apply the feature distribution to classify the prototypic facial expressions. In order to validate our proposed approach, we have conducted experiments for person-independent facial expression recognition using our newly created 3D facial expression database. We also demonstrate the advantages of our 3D geometric based approach over 2D texture based approaches in terms of various head poses.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34374/01640921.pdf","startPage":"1399","endPage":"1406","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.14","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34374","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D Facial Expression Recognition Based on Primitive Surface Feature Distribution","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Face detection","Shape","Humans","Data mining","Head","Skin","Prototypes","Feature extraction","Computer vision"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640921/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","displayDocTitle":"3D Facial Expression Recognition Based on Primitive Surface Feature Distribution","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1640921/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2006","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D Facial Expression Recognition Based on Primitive Surface Feature Distribution","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640921.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061294S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"34374","articleId":"1640921","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1640924,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The method iteratively estimates the parameters of a 3D morphable face model to approximate the appearance of a face in an image. Simultaneously, a visibility map is computed which segments the image into visible and occluded regions. The visibility map is incorporated into a probabilistic image formation model as a set of spatially correlated random variables. This leads to a Generalized Expectation-Maximization algorithm in which the estimation of the morphable model related parameters is interleaved with visibility computations. The validity of the algorithm is verified by a face recognition experiment using images from the publicly available AR Face Database.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.26","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34374/01640924.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34374","startPage":"1423","endPage":"1430","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Generalized EM Approach for 3D Model Based Face Recognition under Occlusions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640924","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Generalized EM Approach for 3D Model Based Face Recognition under Occlusions","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640924/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1640924/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Generalized EM Approach for 3D Model Based Face Recognition under Occlusions","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640924.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09289S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"34374","articleId":"1640924","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-17"},{"_id":1640926,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoming Liu","affiliation":["Visualization and Computer Vision Laboratory, General Electric Global Research, Schenectady, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaoming Liu","id":"37336814700"},{"name":"J.

For face recognition by machines, while much work has been done to create recognition algorithms that are robust to pose variation, little has been done in finding the most representative pose for recognition. In this paper, we use a number of algorithms to evaluate face recognition performance when various poses are used for training. The result, similar to findings in psychology that the 3/4 view is the best, is also justified by the discrimination power of different regions on the face, computed from both the appearance and the geometry of these regions. We believe our study is both scientifically interesting and practically beneficial for many applications.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.216","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34374/01640926.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34374","startPage":"1439","endPage":"1446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Pose for Face Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640926","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Pose for Face Recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640926/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1640926/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Pose for Face Recognition","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640926.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07591S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"34374","articleId":"1640926","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1640927,"authors":[{"name":"M.-E.

We demonstrate that by developing a visual vocabulary that explicitly represents the various aspects (colour, shape, and texture) that distinguish one flower from another, we can overcome the ambiguities that exist between flower categories. The novelty lies in the vocabulary used for each aspect, and how these vocabularies are combined into a final classifier. The various stages of the classifier (vocabulary selection and combination) are each optimized on a validation set. Results are presented on a dataset of 1360 images consisting of 17 flower species.

Visual cues are evaluated by a voting method that compares local image phenomena with a number of visual exemplars for the category. The visual exemplars are obtained using a clustering method applied to text on web pages.

For a 320 \u00d7 280 image, the system can process 5 to 30 frames per second depending on the density in which we scan the image, while maintaining an accuracy level similar to existing methods.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.119","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34374/01640933.pdf","startPage":"1491","endPage":"1498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Human Detection Using a Cascade of Histograms of Oriented Gradients","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640933","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640933/","displayDocTitle":"Fast Human Detection Using a Cascade of Histograms of Oriented Gradients","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1640933/","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Human Detection Using a Cascade of Histograms of Oriented Gradients","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640933.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055515S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"294","xplore-issue":"34374","articleId":"1640933","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1640937,"authors":[{"name":"Sy Bor Wang","affiliation":["Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Sy Bor Wang","id":"37634838300"},{"name":"A.

Gesture sequences often have a complex underlying structure, and models that can incorporate hidden structures have proven to be advantageous for recognition tasks. Most existing approaches to gesture recognition with hidden states employ a Hidden Markov Model or suitable variant (e.g., a factored or coupled state model) to model gesture streams; a significant limitation of these models is the requirement of conditional independence of observations. In addition, hidden states in a generative model are selected to maximize the likelihood of generating all the examples of a given gesture class, which is not necessarily optimal for discriminating the gesture class against other gestures. Previous discriminative approaches to gesture sequence recognition have shown promising results, but have not incorporated hidden states nor addressed the problem of predicting the label of an entire sequence. In this paper, we derive a discriminative sequence model with a hidden state structure, and demonstrate its utility both in a detection and in a multi-way classification formulation. We evaluate our method on the task of recognizing human arm and head gestures, and compare the performance of our method to both generative hidden state and discriminative fully-observable models.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hidden Conditional Random Fields for Gesture Recognition","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.132","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34374/01640937.pdf","startPage":"1521","endPage":"1527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34374","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640937","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640937/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","displayDocTitle":"Hidden Conditional Random Fields for Gesture Recognition","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1640937/","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2006","publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hidden Conditional Random Fields for Gesture Recognition","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640937.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075086S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"34374","articleId":"1640937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1640938,"authors":[{"name":"N.

This is the person reidentification problem. This paper focuses on reidentification algorithms that use the overall appearance of an individual as opposed to passive biometrics such as face and gait. Person reidentification approaches have two aspects: (i) establish correspondence between parts, and (ii) generate signatures that are invariant to variations in illumination, pose, and the dynamic appearance of clothing. A novel spatiotemporal segmentation algorithm is employed to generate salient edgels that are robust to changes in appearance of clothing. The invariant signatures are generated by combining normalized color and salient edgel histograms. Two approaches are proposed to generate correspondences: (i) a model based approach that fits an articulated model to each individual to establish a correspondence map, and (ii) an interest point operator approach that nominates a large number of potential correspondences which are evaluated using a region growing scheme. Finally, the approaches are evaluated on a 44 person database across 3 disparate views.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34374/01640938.pdf","startPage":"1528","endPage":"1535","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34374","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640938","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Person Reidentification Using Spatiotemporal Appearance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spatiotemporal phenomena","Clothing","Cameras","Histograms","Face detection","Surveillance","Biometrics","Lighting","Robustness","Brightness"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640938/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Person Reidentification Using Spatiotemporal Appearance","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1640938/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2006","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Person Reidentification Using Spatiotemporal Appearance","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640938.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055136S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"235","xplore-issue":"34374","articleId":"1640938","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":1640940,"authors":[{"name":"Zhuowen Tu","affiliation":["Department of Neurology, Laboratory of Neuro Imaging"],"lastName":"Zhuowen Tu","id":"37087276719"},{"name":"X.S.

To challenge such problems, we propose the hybrid Fourier features extracted from different frequency bands and multiple face models. The hybrid Fourier feature comprises three different Fourier domains; merged real and imaginary components, Fourier spectrum and phase angle. When deriving Fourier features from three Fourier domains, we define three different frequency bandwidths, so that additional complementary features can be obtained. After this, they are individually classified by Linear Discriminant Analysis. This approach makes possible analyzing a face image from the various viewpoints to recognize identities. Moreover, we propose multiple face models based on different eye positions with a same image size, and it contributes to increasing the performance of the proposed system. We evaluated this proposed system using the Face Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC) experimental protocols known as the largest data sets available. Experimental results on FRGC version 2.0 data sets has proven that the proposed method shows better verification rates than the baseline of FRGC on 2D frontal face images under various situations such as illumination changes, expression changes, and time elapses.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple Face Model of Hybrid Fourier Feature for Large Face Image Set","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.201","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34374/01640944.pdf","startPage":"1574","endPage":"1581","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34374","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640944","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640944/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Face Model of Hybrid Fourier Feature for Large Face Image Set","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1640944/","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2006","publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Face Model of Hybrid Fourier Feature for Large Face Image Set","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640944.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054988S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"34374","articleId":"1640944","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1640946,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In most of these works, local patches are modeled as basic building blocks of an image, analogous to words in text documents. In most previous works using the \"bag of words\" models (e.g. [4, 20, 7]), the local patches are assumed to be independent with each other. In this paper, we relax the independence assumption and model explicitly the inter-dependency of the local regions. Similarly to previous work , we represent images as a collection of patches, each of which belongs to a latent \"theme\" that is shared across images as well as categories. We learn the theme distributions and patch distributions over the themes in a hierarchical structure [22]. In particular, we introduce a linkage structure over the latent themes to encode the dependencies of the patches. This structure enforces the semantic connections among the patches by facilitating better clustering of the themes. As a result, our models for object categories tend to be more discriminative than the ones obtained under the independent patch assumption. We show highly competitive categorization results on both the Caltech 4 and Caltech 101 object category datasets. By examining the distributions of the latent themes for each object category, we construct an object taxonomy using the 101 object classes from the Caltech 101 datasets.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Dependent Regions for Object Categorization in a Generative Framework","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.324","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34374/01640947.pdf","startPage":"1597","endPage":"1604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34374","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640947","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640947/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","displayDocTitle":"Using Dependent Regions for Object Categorization in a Generative Framework","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1640947/","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2006","publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Dependent Regions for Object Categorization in a Generative Framework","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640947.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098482S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"34374","articleId":"1640947","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1640948,"authors":[{"name":"B.C.

We demonstrate that such an algorithm succeeds in automatically discovering many familiar objects in a variety of image datasets, including those from Caltech, MSRC and LabelMe.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Multiple Segmentations to Discover Objects and their Extent in Image Collections","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.326","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34374/01640948.pdf","startPage":"1605","endPage":"1614","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34374","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640948","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","displayDocTitle":"Using Multiple Segmentations to Discover Objects and their Extent in Image Collections","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1640948/","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2006","publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Multiple Segmentations to Discover Objects and their Extent in Image Collections","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640948.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086631S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"354","xplore-issue":"34374","articleId":"1640948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1640954,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Wang","affiliation":["School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"lastName":"Yang Wang","id":"37407552000"},{"name":"Hao Jiang","affiliation":["School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"lastName":"Hao Jiang","id":"37272623700"},{"name":"M.S.

As a result, human identification and tracking are made more difficult because the averaged gait image is too simple to represent the carrying status. Therefore, in this paper we first introduce a set of Gabor based human gait appearance models, because Gabor functions are similar to the receptive field profiles in the mammalian cortical simple cells. The very high dimensionality of the feature space makes training difficult. In order to solve this problem we propose a general tensor discriminant analysis (GTDA), which seamlessly incorporates the object (Gabor based human gait appearance model) structure information as a natural constraint. GTDA differs from the previous tensor based discriminant analysis methods in that the training converges. Existing methods fail to converge in the training stage. This makes them unsuitable for practical tasks. Experiments are carried out on the USF baseline data set to recognize a human\u2019s ID from the gait silhouette. The proposed Gabor gait incorporated with GTDA is demonstrated to significantly outperform the existing appearance-based methods.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.138","endPage":"1677","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34374/01640956.pdf","startPage":"1670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human Carrying Status in Visual Surveillance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640956/","displayDocTitle":"Human Carrying Status in Visual Surveillance","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1640956/","publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human Carrying Status in Visual Surveillance","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640956.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075039S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"34374","articleId":"1640956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1640964,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Still, shrinkage is also practiced successfully with nonunitary, and even redundant representations. In this paper we shed some light on this behavior. We show that simple shrinkage could be interpreted as the first iteration of an algorithm that solves the basis pursuit denoising (BPDN) problem. Thus, this work leads to a novel iterative shrinkage algorithm that can be considered as an effective pursuit method. We demonstrate this algorithm, both on synthetic data, and for the image denoising problem, where we learn the image prior parameters directly from the given image. The results in both cases are superior to several popular alternatives.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34374/01640988.pdf","startPage":"1924","endPage":"1931","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34374","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Denoising with Shrinkage and Redundant Representations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image denoising","Wavelet transforms","Noise reduction","Iterative algorithms","Table lookup","White noise","Pursuit algorithms","Computer science","Iterative methods","Maximum a posteriori estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640988/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","displayDocTitle":"Image Denoising with Shrinkage and Redundant Representations","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1640988/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2006","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Denoising with Shrinkage and Redundant Representations","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640988.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064662S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"34374","articleId":"1640988","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1640993,"authors":[{"name":"P.

It is difficult since often the decision for an edge cannot be made purely based on low level cues such as gradient, instead we need to engage all levels of information, low, middle, and high, in order to decide where to put edges. In this paper we propose a novel supervised learning algorithm for edge and object boundary detection which we refer to as Boosted Edge Learning or BEL for short. A decision of an edge point is made independently at each location in the image; a very large aperture is used providing significant context for each decision. In the learning stage, the algorithm selects and combines a large number of features across different scales in order to learn a discriminative model using an extended version of the Probabilistic Boosting Tree classification algorithm. The learning based framework is highly adaptive and there are no parameters to tune. We show applications for edge detection in a number of specific image domains as well as on natural images. We test on various datasets including the Berkeley dataset and the results obtained are very good.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34374/01640993.pdf","startPage":"1964","endPage":"1971","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34374","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640993","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supervised Learning of Edges and Object Boundaries","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Supervised learning","Image edge detection","Object detection","Computer science","Computer vision","Apertures","Boosting","Application software","Detectors","Neuroimaging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640993/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","displayDocTitle":"Supervised Learning of Edges and Object Boundaries","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1640993/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2006","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supervised Learning of Edges and Object Boundaries","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640993.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060654S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"211","xplore-issue":"34374","articleId":"1640993","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":1640995,"authors":[{"name":"A.E.

A major problem is spatially-varying reduction of contrast by stray radiance (airlight), which is scattered by the haze particles towards the camera. Recent computer vision methods have shown that images can be compensated for haze, and even yield a depth map of the scene. A key step in such a scene recovery is subtraction of the airlight. In particular, this can be achieved by analyzing polarization-filtered images. However, the recovery requires parameters of the airlight. These parameters were estimated in past studies by measuring pixels in sky areas. This paper derives an approach for blindly recovering the parameter needed for separating the airlight from the measurements, thus recovering contrast, with neither user interaction nor existence of the sky in the frame. This eases the interaction and conditions needed for image dehazing, which also requires compensation for attenuation. The approach has proved successful in experiments, some of which are shown here.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.71","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34374/01640996.pdf","startPage":"1984","endPage":"1991","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.71","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Haze Separation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640996","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","displayDocTitle":"Blind Haze Separation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640996/","publicationDate":"2006","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1640996/","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Haze Separation","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640996.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071408S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"275","xplore-issue":"34374","articleId":"1640996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1640997,"authors":[{"name":"M.F.

In this paper, we present a method for estimating intrinsic component images from a single image, which we apply to the problems of estimating shading and albedo images and image denoising. Our method is based on learning estimators that predict filtered versions of the desired image. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not require unnatural discretizations of the problem. We also demonstrate how to learn a weighting function that properly weights the local estimates when constructing the estimated image. For shading estimation, we introduce a new training set of real-world images. The accuracy of our method is measured both qualitatively and quantitatively, showing better performance on the shading/albedo separation problem than previous approaches. The performance on denoising is competitive with the current state of the art.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.114","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34374/01640997.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34374","startPage":"1992","endPage":"1999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimating Intrinsic Component Images using Non-Linear Regression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640997","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Estimating Intrinsic Component Images using Non-Linear Regression","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640997/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1640997/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating Intrinsic Component Images using Non-Linear Regression","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640997.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.15921S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"34374","articleId":"1640997","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":1640999,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Chang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Hong Chang","id":"37087495921"},{"name":"Dit-Yan Yeung","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Dit-Yan Yeung","id":"37087150848"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2597-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"1640999","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":246},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640999","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laplace equations","Kernel","Face recognition","Machine learning","Pattern recognition","Application software","Robustness","Nearest neighbor searches","Computer vision","Linear discriminant analysis"]}],"abstract":"Classification with only one labeled example per class is a challenging problem in machine learning and pattern recognition. While there have been some attempts to address this problem in the context of specific applications, very little work has been done so far on the problem under more general object classification settings. In this paper, we propose a graph-based approach to the problem. Based on a robust path-based similarity measure proposed recently, we construct a weighted graph using the robust path-based similarities as edge weights. A kernel matrix, called graph Laplacian kernel, is then defined based on the graph Laplacian. With the kernel matrix, in principle any kernel-based classifier can be used for classification. In particular, we demonstrate the use of a kernel nearest neighbor classifier on some synthetic data and real-world image sets, showing that our method can successfully solve some difficult classification tasks with only very few labeled examples.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.128","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34374/01640999.pdf","startPage":"2011","endPage":"2016","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graph Laplacian Kernels for Object Classification from a Single Example","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Graph Laplacian Kernels for Object Classification from a Single Example","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1640999/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1640999/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graph Laplacian Kernels for Object Classification from a Single Example","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01640999.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041929S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"34374","articleId":"1640999","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1641002,"authors":[{"name":"S.

These approaches admit efficient inference algorithms while capturing the important kinematic constraints of the human body as a graphical model. These methods often fail however when multiple body parts fit the same image region resulting in global pose estimates that poorly explain the overall image evidence. Attempts to solve this problem have focused on the use of strong prior models that are limited to learned activities such as walking. We argue that the problem actually lies with the image observations and not with the prior. In particular, image evidence for each body part is estimated independently of other parts without regard to self-occlusion. To address this we introduce occlusion-sensitive local likelihoods that approximate the global image likelihood using per-pixel hidden binary variables that encode the occlusion relationships between parts. This occlusion reasoning introduces interactions between non-adjacent body parts creating loops in the underlying graphical model. We deal with this using an extension of an approximate belief propagation algorithm (PAMPAS). The algorithm recovers the real-valued 2D pose of the body in the presence of occlusions, does not require strong priors over body pose and does a quantitatively better job of explaining image evidence than previous methods.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.180","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34374/01641003.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34374","startPage":"2041","endPage":"2048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measure Locally, Reason Globally: Occlusion-sensitive Articulated Pose Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1641003","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Measure Locally, Reason Globally: Occlusion-sensitive Articulated Pose Estimation","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1641003/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1641003/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measure Locally, Reason Globally: Occlusion-sensitive Articulated Pose Estimation","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01641003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073228S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"34374","articleId":"1641003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1641004,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Yet, previous research has mostly focused on models that are purely top-down or bottom-up. Here, we propose a new model that combines both. The bottom-up component computes the visual salience of scene locations in different feature maps extracted at multiple spatial scales. The topdown component uses accumulated statistical knowledge of the visual features of the desired search target and background clutter, to optimally tune the bottom-up maps such that target detection speed is maximized. Testing on 750 artificial and natural scenes shows that the model\u2019s predictions are consistent with a large body of available literature on human psychophysics of visual search. These results suggest that our model may provide good approximation of how humans combine bottom-up and top-down cues such as to optimize target detection speed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Integrated Model of Top-Down and Bottom-Up Attention for Optimizing Detection Speed","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.54","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34374/01641004.pdf","startPage":"2049","endPage":"2056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34374","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1641004","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1641004/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","displayDocTitle":"An Integrated Model of Top-Down and Bottom-Up Attention for Optimizing Detection Speed","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1641004/","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2006","publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Integrated Model of Top-Down and Bottom-Up Attention for Optimizing Detection Speed","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01641004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118044S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"165","xplore-issue":"34374","articleId":"1641004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1641009,"authors":[{"name":"E.

This approach is quite flexible, and permits recognition based on color, texture, and particularly shape, in a homogeneous framework. While nearest neighbor classifiers are natural in this setting, they suffer from the problem of high variance (in bias-variance decomposition) in the case of limited sampling. Alternatively, one could use support vector machines but they involve time-consuming optimization and computation of pairwise distances. We propose a hybrid of these two methods which deals naturally with the multiclass setting, has reasonable computational complexity both in training and at run time, and yields excellent results in practice. The basic idea is to find close neighbors to a query sample and train a local support vector machine that preserves the distance function on the collection of neighbors. Our method can be applied to large, multiclass data sets for which it outperforms nearest neighbor and support vector machines, and remains efficient when the problem becomes intractable for support vector machines. A wide variety of distance functions can be used and our experiments show state-of-the-art performance on a number of benchmark data sets for shape and texture classification (MNIST, USPS, CUReT) and object recognition (Caltech- 101). On Caltech-101 we achieved a correct classification rate of 59.05%(\u00b10.56%) at 15 training images per class, and 66.23%(\u00b10.48%) at 30 training images.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.301","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34374/01641014.pdf","startPage":"2126","endPage":"2136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34374","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1641014","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SVM-KNN: Discriminative Nearest Neighbor Classification for Visual Category Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1641014/","displayDocTitle":"SVM-KNN: Discriminative Nearest Neighbor Classification for Visual Category Recognition","isConference":true,"volume":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1641014/","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2006","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SVM-KNN: Discriminative Nearest Neighbor Classification for Visual Category Recognition","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01641014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07053S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"500","xplore-issue":"34374","articleId":"1641014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1641016,"authors":[{"name":"Ya Jin","affiliation":["Division of Applied Mathematics, Brown University, USA"],"lastName":"Ya Jin","id":"38041223700"},{"name":"S.

We propose a mathematical framework (a \"composition machine\") for constructing probabilistic hierarchical image models, designed to accommodate arbitrary contextual relationships, and we build a demonstration system for reading Massachusetts license plates in an image set collected at Logan Airport. The demonstration system detects and correctly reads more than 98% of the plates, with a negligible rate of false detection. Unlike a formal grammar, the architecture of a composition machine does not exclude the sharing of sub-parts among multiple entities, and does not limit interpretations to single trees (e.g. a scene can have multiple license plates, or no plates at all). In this sense, the architecture is more like a general Bayesian network than a formal grammar.

The efficiency and quality is exhibited in a live demonstration that recognizes CD-covers from a database of 40000 images of popular music CD\u2019s. The scheme builds upon popular techniques of indexing descriptors extracted from local regions, and is robust to background clutter and occlusion. The local region descriptors are hierarchically quantized in a vocabulary tree. The vocabulary tree allows a larger and more discriminatory vocabulary to be used efficiently, which we show experimentally leads to a dramatic improvement in retrieval quality. The most significant property of the scheme is that the tree directly defines the quantization. The quantization and the indexing are therefore fully integrated, essentially being one and the same. The recognition quality is evaluated through retrieval on a database with ground truth, showing the power of the vocabulary tree approach, going as high as 1 million images.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.264","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34374/01641018.pdf","startPage":"2161","endPage":"2168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable Recognition with a Vocabulary Tree","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1641018","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","displayDocTitle":"Scalable Recognition with a Vocabulary Tree","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1641018/","publicationDate":"2006","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1641018/","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable Recognition with a Vocabulary Tree","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01641018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053161S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"1801","xplore-issue":"34374","articleId":"1641018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":1641019,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This makes it difficult to reconstruct objects which are partially occluded. Recently, researchers working with large camera arrays have shown it is possible to \"see through\" occlusions using a technique called synthetic aperture focusing. This suggests that we can design alternative cost functions that are robust to occlusions using synthetic apertures. Our paper explores this design space. We compare classical shape from stereo with shape from synthetic aperture focus. We also describe two variants of multi-view stereo based on color medians and entropy that increase robustness to occlusions. We present an experimental comparison of these cost functions on complex light fields, measuring their accuracy against the amount of occlusion.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.244","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34374/01641039.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34374","startPage":"2331","endPage":"2338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstructing Occluded Surfaces Using Synthetic Apertures: Stereo, Focus and Robust Measures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1641039","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reconstructing Occluded Surfaces Using Synthetic Apertures: Stereo, Focus and Robust Measures","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1641039/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1641039/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstructing Occluded Surfaces Using Synthetic Apertures: Stereo, Focus and Robust Measures","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01641039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064721S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"34374","articleId":"1641039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1641041,"authors":[{"name":"Qyngxiong Yang","affiliation":["University of Kentucky"],"lastName":"Qyngxiong Yang"},{"name":"Liang Wang","affiliation":["Center for Visualization and Virtual Environments, University of Kentucky, USA"],"lastName":"Liang Wang","id":"37311071800"},{"name":"Ruigang Yang","affiliation":["Center for Visualization and Virtual Environments, University of Kentucky, USA"],"lastName":"Ruigang Yang","id":"37277874700"},{"name":"H.

Firstly, intensity consistent disparity selection is proposed for handling untextured areas. Secondly, discontinuity preserving interpolation is suggested for filling holes in the disparity images that are caused by some filters.

Object categories are modeled via distributions over the 3D location and appearance of visual features. Uncertainty in the number of object instances depicted in a particular image is then achieved via a transformed Dirichlet process. In contrast with image-based approaches to object recognition, we model scale variations as the perspective projection of objects in different 3D poses. To calibrate the underlying geometry, we incorporate binocular stereo images into the training process. A robust likelihood model accounts for outliers in matched stereo features, allowing effective learning of 3D object structure from partial 2D segmentations. Applied to a dataset of office scenes, our model detects objects at multiple scales via a coarse reconstruction of the corresponding 3D geometry.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.97","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.97","startPage":"2410","endPage":"2417","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34374/01641049.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1641049","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1641049/","displayDocTitle":"Depth from Familiar Objects: A Hierarchical Model for 3D Scenes","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1641049/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Depth from Familiar Objects: A Hierarchical Model for 3D Scenes","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01641049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064052S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"34374","articleId":"1641049","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1641050,"authors":[{"name":"E.

We also recognize different objects, decide on their orientations, and identify how they are connected to their environment. Focusing on the problem of autonomous 3d reconstruction of indoor scenes, in this paper we present a dynamic Bayesian network model capable of resolving some of these ambiguities and recovering 3d information for many images. Our model assumes a \"floorwall\" geometry on the scene and is trained to recognize the floor-wall boundary in each column of the image. When the image is produced under perspective geometry, we show that this model can be used for 3d reconstruction from a single image. To our knowledge, this was the first monocular approach to automatically recover 3d reconstructions from single indoor images.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Dynamic Bayesian Network Model for Autonomous 3D Reconstruction from a Single Indoor Image","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2006.23","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10924/34374/01641050.pdf","startPage":"2418","endPage":"2428","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34374","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1641050","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1641050/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","displayDocTitle":"A Dynamic Bayesian Network Model for Autonomous 3D Reconstruction from a Single Indoor Image","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1641050/","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2006","publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dynamic Bayesian Network Model for Autonomous 3D Reconstruction from a Single Indoor Image","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01641050.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063449S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10924","isNumber":"34374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10924","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"34374","articleId":"1641050","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1641156,"authors":[{"name":"R.

More in general, this technique can be adopted to calibrate any robot bearing sensor. It is based on the extended Kalman filter. It is very simple and allows an automatic self-calibration during the robot motion. It only requires a source of light in the environment and an odometry system on the robot. The strategy is theoretically validated through an observability analysis which takes into account the system nonlinearities. This analysis shows that the system contains all the necessary information to perform the self-calibration. Furthermore, many accurate simulations and experiments performed on a real platform equipped with encoder sensors and an omnidirectional conic vision sensor, show the exceptional performance of the strategy","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2006 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2006.

Recently, random sample consensus (RANSAC), a robust multi-hypothesis estimator, has been successfully applied to offline relocation in static environments. On the other hand, online relocation in dynamic environments is still a difficult problem, for available computation time is always limited, and for measurement include many outliers. To realize real time algorithm for such an online process, we have developed an incremental version of RANSAC algorithm by extending an efficient preemption RANSAC scheme.

These algorithms utilize feasibility checks to differentiate valid paths from invalid ones. Unfortunately, the computationally expensive nature of such checks reduces the effectiveness of motion planning algorithms. However, by using hardware acceleration to speed up the feasibility checks, we can greatly enhance the performance of the motion planning algorithms. Of course, such acceleration is not limited to feasibility checks; other components of motion planning algorithms can also be accelerated using specially designed hardware. A field programmable gate array (FPGA) is a great platform to support such an acceleration. An FPGA is a collection of digital gates which can be reprogrammed at run time, i.e., it can be used as a CPU that reconfigures itself for a given task. In this paper, we study the feasibility of an FPGA based motion planning processor and evaluate its performance. In order to leverage its highly parallel nature and its modular structure, our processor utilizes the probabilistic roadmap method at its core. The modularity enables us to replace the feasibility criteria with other ones. The reconfigurability lets us run our processor in different roles, such as a motion planning co-processor, an autonomous motion planning processor or dedicated collision detection chip. Our experiments show that such a processor is not only feasible but also can greatly increase the performance of current algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1641172/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9120512","htmlLink":"/document/1641172/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","conferenceDate":"15-19 May 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A motion planning processor on reconfigurable hardware","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A motion planning processor on reconfigurable hardware","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"01641172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081266S","chronDate":"15-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10932","isNumber":"34383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10932","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"34383","articleId":"1641172","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1641176,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In order to achieve high-speed regrasping, we propose a new strategy which we call dynamic regrasping. In this strategy, the regrasping task is achieved by throwing a target up and by catching it. In this paper, a regrasping strategy based on visual feedback is presented and experimental results using a high-speed multifingered robot hand and a high-speed vision system are shown.

At that time, pending patent applications prevented the presentation of a detailed description of certain forms and improvements which are to-day common knowledge among radio engineers. It is my purpose herein to outline briefly the subsequent development of the Audion, both as a radio detector and as an amplifier of minute electric impulses. The improved Audion, containing one hot and two independent cold electrodes, is described, and its action as a sensitive detector in radio telegraph and telephone work outlined. Its actiont is shown to be not that of a simple rectifier or valve, but that of a true relay device. The secondary circuit of a radio receiving transformer is connected in shunt between the \"grid\" electrode and the filament. The telephone receiver and dry battery are connected between the plate electrode and filament. There appears to be no known limit of sensitiveness below which the effect of minute received energy fails to be registered. The device is constant and reliable, requiring only initial adjustments of battery voltages. The Audion is incontestably a \"potential operated\" device.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1641242/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1914","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1914","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","publicationDate":"March 1914","volume":"2","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The audion-detector and amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The audion-detector and amplifier","sourcePdf":"01641242.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035145S","chronDate":"March  1914","isNumber":"34388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5547934","citationCount":"11","articleId":"1641242","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1914","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1641324,"authors":[{"name":"R.B.

However, the most significant effects of LSI on the semiconductor manufacturer are in the areas of design and testing; techniques used in the past for simpler integrated circuits are inadequate for LSI.","doi":"10.1109/C-M.1972.216915","publicationTitle":"Computer","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel5/2/34405/01641549.pdf","startPage":"36","endPage":"45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/C-M.1972.216915","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer Aided Design for Large-Scale Integrated Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May-June  1972","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1641549/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  1972","displayDocTitle":"Computer Aided Design for Large-Scale Integrated Circuits","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","publicationDate":"May-June 1972","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer Aided Design for Large-Scale Integrated Circuits","sourcePdf":"01641549.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034796S","chronDate":"May-June  1972","isNumber":"34405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","articleId":"1641549","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1641550,"authors":[{"name":"I.S.

It shows that the algorithm degenerates with time, regardless of the number of particles used or the density of landmarks within the environment, and would always produce optimistic estimates of uncertainty in the long-term. In essence, FastSLAM behaves like a non-optimal local search algorithm; in the short-term it may produce consistent uncertainty estimates but, in the long-term, it is unable to adequately explore the state-space to be a reasonable Bayesian estimator. However, the number of particles and landmarks does affect the accuracy of the estimated mean and, given sufficient particles, FastSLAM can produce good non-stochastic estimates in practice. FastSLAM also has several practical advantages, particularly with regard to data association, and would probably work well in combination with other versions of stochastic SLAM, such as EKF-based SLAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1641748/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9120404","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1641748/","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","conferenceDate":"15-19 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Consistency of the FastSLAM algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consistency of the FastSLAM algorithm","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"01641748.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060982S","chronDate":"15-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10932","isNumber":"34383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10932","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"34383","articleId":"1641748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1641769,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Usually, three-dimensional (3-D) measurement by robot vision techniques is executed under the assumptions that cameras and objects are in aerial environments. However, an image distortion occurs when vision sensors measure objects in liquid. It is caused by the refraction of the light on the boundary between the air and the liquid, and the distorted image brings errors in a triangulation for the range measurement. Additionally, it is often the case that there exist air bubbles in the field of view when we observe aquatic environments. Therefore, it becomes difficult to acquire clear images because of these view-disturbing noises. As to the former problem, accurate 3-D coordinates of objects' surfaces in liquid are measured by taking for calculating the refraction effect. As to the latter problem, bubble noises are eliminated from a moving image to divide objects in the image into still backgrounds, moving objects, and bubble noise by an image processing technique.

Belta and V. Kumar, 2004). We define a nine-dimensional abstraction of the swarm that has a product structure of the six-dimensional Euclidean group and a three-dimensional shape, and is independent of the number of robots. The group captures the pose of an ellipsoid spanning the swarm with semiaxes given by the shape variables. The overall abstract description is invariant to robot permutations.

The laser samples the local geometry of the environment and is used to incrementally build a 3D point-cloud map of the workspace. Sequences of images from the camera are used to detect loop closure events (without reference to the internal estimates of vehicle location) using a novel appearance-based retrieval system. The loop closure detection is robust to repetitive visual structure and provides a probabilistic measure of confidence. The images suggesting loop closure are then further processed with their corresponding local laser scans to yield putative Euclidean image-image transformations. We show how naive application of this transformation to effect the loop closure can lead to catastrophic linearization errors and go on to describe a way in which gross, pre-loop closing errors can be successfully annulled. We demonstrate our system working in a challenging, outdoor setting containing substantial loops and beguiling, gently curving traversals. The results are overlaid on an aerial image to provide a ground truth comparison with the estimated map. The paper concludes with an extension into the multi-robot domain in which 3D maps resulting from distinct SLAM sessions (no common reference frame) are combined without recourse to mutual observation","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outdoor SLAM using visual appearance and laser ranging","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2006 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2006.

The new micro pneumatic end-effector system consists of a DC micro-diaphragm pump and compressor, one region of flexible latex tube, a Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) sensor for in-situ measurement of micro force, and a micro steel tip. The micro steel tip of the new pneumatic end effector system has an internal diameter (ID) of 20 mum used for handling nano entities such as carbon nanotubes, DNA, micro/nano particles as well as for microfluidic handling and droplet control. The DC micro-diaphragm pump is automatically controlled via a voltage driver interfaced with a computer in order to effectively and efficiently control suction force and pressure during microfluidic handling and droplet control in nano manufacturing. The new pneumatic end effector system with force sensing can significantly improve the success rate for handling/depositing micro/nano entities in the case of carbon nanotubes. The experimental results show the success rate of placing carbon nanotubes between electrodes can reach close to 80%.

For this system to be developed further, to achieve full automation, this first phase had to succeed. The interactive GUI records and displays: real-time video images of the cells; processed images of cells; and the microinjection strategies adopted by operators during cell manipulation through a real-time video processing algorithm.

This paper presents a new analysis of the effects of actuator limits on continuum robots. Based on the new understanding of the configuration space uncovered, we derive for the first time the configuration space of continuum robots when constrained by actuator length limits.

The control signal is composed of a linear superposition of three terms 1) damping shaping, 2) task-space position-error feedback with a single stiffness parameter, and 3) gravity compensation by means of estimation of uncertainty in the potential energy. It is shown through computer simulation and theoretical analysis that the signal can generate smooth reaching motions provided that a set of damping factors and the stiffness parameter are selected in a synergistic way. A physical meaning of each term of the control signal is discussed from the viewpoints of Newtonian mechanics and neuro-physiology.

It is required to obtain positional and angular signals around 1,000 Hz to control a mechanical system. A vision sensor must obtain visual features of a target object, synchronizing its sampling rate to the sampling rate of the control. Thus, we need 1) image capturing over 1,000 Hz with high resolution, 2) visual feature computation at the capturing rate, and 3) visual feature transmission to a control system with little delay. We propose the CMOS+FPGA vision system to realize 1,000 Hz visual feedback. This system consists of a CMOS image detector to capture images at 1,000 Hz and an FPGA to compute image features at this sampling rate. First we introduce the CMOS+FPGA vision system. Second, we show the implementation of the computation of the image gravity center. Then, we show the implementation of matched filter. Finally, we apply the image gravity center circuit to the visual control of a flexible link","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2006.1642008","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2006 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2006.

The desired force closure value is calculated according to the pre-shape measured tendons tension and to the grasping force. In the second phase, the involved fingers rapidly close around the object to perform a balanced distribution of the forces within the hand, as it happens in the human hand.

A nonlinear complimentary filter exploiting the structure of special orthogonal group S0(3) is proposed. The filter is expressed explicitly in terms of direct and untreated measurements. For a typical low cost inertial measurement where two inertial directions are measured (gravitational and magnetic fields) along with angular velocity, it is shown that the filter is well conditioned. If only a single direction is available (typically the gravitational field) along with angular velocity, it is shown that the full gyro bias vector is correctly estimated and that the estimated orientation converges to a set consistent with the measurements.

Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms attempt to fuse these estimates to produce a map and a robot trajectory. The constraints are generally non-linear, thus SLAM can be viewed as a non-linear optimization problem. The optimization can be difficult, due to poor initial estimates arising from odometry data, and due to the size of the state space. We present a fast non-linear optimization algorithm that rapidly recovers the robot trajectory, even when given a poor initial estimate. Our approach uses a variant of stochastic gradient descent on an alternative state-space representation that has good stability and computational properties. We compare our algorithm to several others, using both real and synthetic data sets","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2006 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2006.

First, it handles zones in the robot workspace with different degrees of desirability. Given the random quality of paths that are calculated by traditional PRM approaches, this provides a mean to specify a sampling strategy that controls the search process to generate better paths by simply annotating regions in the free workspace with degrees of desirability. Second, our approach can efficiently re-compute paths in dynamic environments where obstacles and zones can change shape or move concurrently with the robot. Third, it can incrementally improve the quality of a generated path, so that a suboptimal solution is available when required for immediate action, but get improved as more planning time is affordable","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2006.1642057","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2006 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2006.

A unified sensor model and a unified objective function are proposed to enable search-and-tracking (SAT) within the recursive Bayesian filter framework. The strength of the proposed technique is that a vehicle can switch its task mode between search and tracking while maintaining and using information collected during the operation. Numerical results first show the effectiveness of the proposed technique when a found target becomes lost and must be searched for again. The proposed technique was then applied to a practical marine search-and-rescue (SAR) scenario where heterogeneous vehicles coordinated to search for and track multiple targets.

Object identification and tracking are typical elements of most missions. While large and expensive UAVs operate in many theatres, there is a need for local intelligence gathering using small, low cost and often disposable UAV platforms. In many situations it may not be practical or desirable for the UAV to be relaying information to the ground via radio link. Similarly, waiting upon ground based control for instruction may also limit the usefulness of a UAV. While ground based control is common, full autonomy allows a UAV to operate beyond the range of human intervention. In such cases, the UAV must be capable of making decisions for itself based on information gained from its surroundings. This paper discusses the development of a vision processing system for a low-cost UAV with a total flying weight of under 3 kg. The system has currently been tested using simulated and real aerial footage with a mission to detect the presence of cars and land vehicles in the field of view. Experiments were conducted using actual FPGA based hardware. This research was conducted by Ashiri and Pyke as part of an undergraduate thesis project in the Dept. Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering at Monash University","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1642134/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 May 2006","publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 May 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1642134/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","accessionNumber":"9120506","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Real time object detection for an unmanned aerial vehicle using an FPGA based vision system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real time object detection for an unmanned aerial vehicle using an FPGA based vision system","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"01642134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08214S","chronDate":"15-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10932","isNumber":"34383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10932","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"34383","articleId":"1642134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1642135,"authors":[{"name":"F.

To do that, the information of terrain appearance and geometry regarding some location is correlated to the slip measured by the rover while this location is being traversed. This relationship is learned from previous experience, so slip can be predicted later at a distance from visual information only. The advantages of the approach are: 1) learning from examples allows the system to adapt to unknown terrains rather than using fixed heuristics or predefined rules; 2) the feedback about the observed slip is received from the vehicle's own sensors which can fully automate the process; 3) learning slip from previous experience can replace complex mechanical modeling of vehicle or terrain, which is time consuming and not necessarily feasible. Predicting slip is motivated by the need to assess the risk of getting trapped before entering a particular terrain. For example, a planning algorithm can utilize slip information by taking into consideration that a slippery terrain is costly or hazardous to traverse. A generic nonlinear regression framework is proposed in which the terrain type is determined from appearance and then a nonlinear model of slip is learned for a particular terrain type. In this paper we focus only on the latter problem and provide slip learning and prediction results for terrain types, such as soil, sand, gravel, and asphalt. The slip prediction error achieved is about 15% which is comparable to the measurement errors for slip itself","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Computational geometry","Information geometry","Feedback","Mechanical sensors","Sensor systems","Vehicles","Soil","Asphalt","Measurement errors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","mobile robots","planetary rovers","telerobotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ground robots","slip prediction","exploration rover","stereo imagery","planning algorithm","generic nonlinear regression framework"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2006.1642209","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2006 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2006.

Several leg exoskeletons have been developed by various groups in an attempt to augment the load carrying capability of the human. Previous research efforts have not fully exploited the passive dynamics of walking and have largely focused on fully actuated exoskeletons that are heavy with large energy requirements. In this paper, a lightweight, underactuated exoskeleton design is presented that runs in parallel to the human and supports the weight of a payload. Two exoskeleton architectures are pursued based on examining human walking data. A first architecture consists of springs at the hip, a variable impedance device at the knee, and springs at the ankle. A second architecture replaces the springs at the hip with a non-conservative actuator to examine the effect of adding power at desired instances throughout the gait cycle. Preliminary studies show that an efficient, underactuated leg exoskeleton can effectively transmit payload forces to the ground during the walking cycle","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1642234/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9120490","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1642234/","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","conferenceDate":"15-19 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Development of a lightweight, underactuated exoskeleton for load-carrying augmentation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a lightweight, underactuated exoskeleton for load-carrying augmentation","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"01642234.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039178S","chronDate":"15-19 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10932","isNumber":"34383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10932","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"34383","articleId":"1642234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1642239,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyin Shao","affiliation":["Department of Manufacturing Engineering and Engineering Management, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Xiaoyin Shao","id":"37286373000"},{"name":"Dong Sun","affiliation":["Department of Manufacturing Engineering and Engineering Management, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Dong Sun","id":"37277362800"},{"name":"J.K.

The main idea is to remove the servo control loop from the DSP (digital signal processor) to a FPGA (field programmable gate array), and utilize the high speed hardwired logic of the FPGA to enhance the computation capability and relieve the computing load on the DSP. The control algorithm is partitioned into a linear portion and a nonlinear portion. The linear portion with position/velocity feedback represents the major control loop and is implemented in the FPGA. The nonlinear portion acts as dynamic compensation to the linear portion to perform complex modeling related calculations, and is implemented in the DSP. A new FPGA-based motion control IC is designed to realize this new control hardware structure. Experiments were conducted on a Yamaha robot manipulator to compare new control architecture and the existing one, when the same control algorithm was used. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed new control architecture exhibits much improved motion performance especially during high-speed motions","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2006.1642239","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2006 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2006.

These rules are written to train and guide safe human operation of marine vehicles and are heavily dependent on human common sense in determining rule applicability as well as rule execution, especially when multiple rules apply simultaneously. To capture the flexibility exploited by humans, this work applies a novel method of multi-objective optimization, interval programming, in a behavior-based control framework for representing the navigation rules, as well as task behaviors, in a way that achieves simultaneous optimal satisfaction.

The developed approach is designed to enable the manipulator to conserve the joint configuration in cyclic trajectories and to avoid the joint limits. Since the inverse kinematics in this problem has an infinite number of joint angle vectors, a fuzzy neural network (FNN) is designed to provide an approximate value for that vector. Feeding this vector as an additional hint input vector to the NN limits and guides the output of the NN within the self-motion. The derivation of the Lyapunov function which is designed to achieve both of the tasks, leads to a computationally efficient online learning algorithm of the NN.

It is well known that these angular momentum equations are nonholonomic, i.e., are nonintegrable rate equations. If the base of the free-floating robot is partially actuated, it is difficult to attain trajectories of the joints that result in point-to-point motion of the entire robot system in its configuration space. However, if the drift-less system associated with the angular momentum conservation equations is shown to be differentially flat, point-to-point maneuvers of the free-floating robot in its configuration space can be constructed. However, an open research problem in the current literature is to show the property of differential flatness for a general space robot. The primary contributions of this paper are as follows: (i) study systematically the structure of the nonholonomic rate constraint equations of a free-floating open-chain space robot with arbitrarily oriented joints and two momentum wheels; (ii) establish the design conditions under which the system exhibits differential flatness; (iii) exploit these design conditions for point-to-point trajectory planning and control of the space robot","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2006.1642294","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2006 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2006.

This snake-like robot is designed for distal dexterity enhancement in MIS surgery of the throat. Actuation compensation is required to account for the flexibility of the actuation lines that connect this snake-like robot with its remote actuation units. The paper presents both a naive model-based compensation approach and a combined model-based recursive linear-estimation approach that uses data gathered from external measurements of the snake-like unit configuration such as vision. The kinematic and static model of this multi-backbone snake-like unit is reviewed and a simplified redundancy resolution is implemented in the error compensation model. The results show that the performance of the snake-like unit is significantly improved when compensation is implemented. The combined model-based recursive linear estimation method showed 1deg accuracy in path tracking. Finally, an updated Jacobian that accounts for the required compensation is presented.

In this paper, OFDM modulation is studied for HDTV transmission on a 6 MHz bandwidth channel by using coaxial cable as a transmission medium. Attenuation, phase shift and propagation time are considered, as well as the prevailing degradations on CATV: thermal noise and crosstalk. We compress the video source information in terms of the Vector Quantization (VQ) technique, which is found to be very robust against channel errors. According to our results, we give some recommendations about the design of the filters required in the system and the minimum frequency guard bands between adjacent channels.","doi":"10.1109/TLA.2005.1642415","publicationTitle":"IEEE Latin America Transactions","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Latin America Transactions","pdfPath":"/iel5/9907/34413/01642415.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TLA.2005.1642415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34413","startPage":"248","endPage":"254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VQ Digital Video Transmission through Coaxial Cable using OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1642415","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"VQ Digital Video Transmission through Coaxial Cable using OFDM","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1642415/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2005","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 2005","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VQ Digital Video Transmission through Coaxial Cable using OFDM","sourcePdf":"3TLA3_04Prieto.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049983S","chronDate":"July  2005","isNumber":"34413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9907","articleId":"1642415","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1642432,"authors":[{"name":"C.L. da S.

Visual servoing can be useful for a wide range of applications and it can be used to control many different dynamic systems (manipulator arms, mobile robots, autonomous underwater vehicles, aircraft, etc.). However, visual servoing systems are not complete efficiency due to the numerous problems that are still unresolved. In this paper a new general solution to visibility restriction associated to all visual servoing techniques based directly or un-directly on image features is presented. This solution allows the temporary disappearance of image features during the control task versus the solutions proposed until now which are based on keeping always the object in the field of view. Taking into account this concept, the theoretical bases of a continuous and stable visual servoing approach that allows the temporary presence of features in the image have been defined and developed. Using them, the camera invariant visual servoing approach has been reformulated to adapt it to the temporary disappearance of image features during the control task.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computational Technique to UPML Absorbing Boundary Conditions by FDTD: A Complete Approach","publicationTitle":"IEEE Latin America Transactions","doi":"10.1109/TLA.2005.1642432","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Latin America Transactions","pdfPath":"/iel5/9907/34415/01642432.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TLA.2005.1642432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34415","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1642432","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1642432/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2005","displayDocTitle":"Computational Technique to UPML Absorbing Boundary Conditions by FDTD: A Complete Approach","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computational Technique to UPML Absorbing Boundary Conditions by FDTD: A Complete Approach","sourcePdf":"3TLA5_01Almeida.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073113S","chronDate":"Dec.  2005","isNumber":"34415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9907","citationCount":"1","articleId":"1642432","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1642449,"authors":[{"name":"S.A. de Souza","affiliation":["Departamento de Engenharia El\u00e9trica, Escola de Engenharia de S\u00e3o Carlos,EPUSP, Universidade de S\u00e1o Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"S.A.","lastName":"de Souza","id":"37071081300"},{"name":"R.

This paper examines the performance of these algorithms for small displacements (less than half the ultrasound pulse wavelength). The effects of noise, bandwidth, stationary echoes, kernel size, downsampling, interpolation, and quadrature demodulation on the accuracy of the time delay estimates are measured in terms of bias and jitter. Particular attention is given to the accuracy and resolution of the displacement measurements and to the computational efficiency of the algorithms. In most cases, Loupas' two-dimensional (2-D) autocorrelator performs as well as the gold standard, normalized cross correlation. However, Loupas' algorithm's calculation time is significantly faster, and it is particularly suited to operate on the signal data format most commonly used in ultrasound scanners. These results are used to implement a real-time ARFI imaging system using a commercial ultrasound scanner and a computer cluster.

The precise numerical simulation of such devices, including all physical effects, is currently beyond the capacity of high-end computation. Therefore, we have to restrict the numerical analysis to the periodic substructure. By using the finite-element method (FEM), this can be done by introducing periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) at special artificial boundaries. To be able to describe the complete dispersion behavior of waves, including damping effects, the PBC has to be able to model each mode that can be excited within the periodic structure. Therefore, the condition used for the PBCs must hold for each phase and amplitude difference existing at periodic boundaries. Based on the Floquet theorem, our two newly developed PBC algorithms allow the calculation of both, the phase and the amplitude coefficients of the wave. In the first part of this paper we describe the basic theory of the PBCs. Based on the FEM, we develop two different methods that deliver the same results but have totally different numerical properties and, therefore, allow the use of problem-adapted solvers. Further on, we show how to compute the charge distribution of periodic SAW structures with the aid of the new PBCs. In the second part, we compare the measured and simulated dispersion behavior of waves propagating on periodic SAW structures for two different piezoelectric substrates. Then we compare measured and simulated input admittances of structures similar to SAW resonators.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2006.1642518","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","startPage":"1192","endPage":"1201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2006.1642518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34419","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/34419/01642518.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Surface acoustic waves","Periodic structures","Computational modeling","Dispersion","Acoustic propagation","Surface acoustic wave devices","Acoustic waves","Numerical simulation","Physics computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["piezoelectric materials","surface acoustic waves","periodic structures","finite element analysis","acoustic wave propagation","damping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite-element simulation","wave propagation","periodic piezoelectric SAW structures","surface acoustic wave devices","quasiperiodic structures","FEM","periodic boundary conditions","damping effects","Floquet theorem","problem-adapted solvers","charge distribution","piezoelectric substrates","SAW resonators"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Acoustics","Computer Simulation","Computer-Aided Design","Electrochemistry","Equipment Failure Analysis","Finite Element Analysis","Materials Testing","Models, Theoretical","Periodicity","Radiation Dosage","Radiometry","Surface Properties"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Finite-element simulation of wave propagation in periodic piezoelectric SAW structures","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1642518/","volume":"53","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1642518/","accessionNumber":"8974532","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"16846152","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","publicationDate":"June 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-element simulation of wave propagation in periodic piezoelectric SAW structures","sourcePdf":"01642518.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074879S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"34419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"34419","articleId":"1642518","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1642519,"authors":[{"name":"D.T.

The CMUT ring array has a diameter of 2 mm and 64 elements each 100 /spl mu/m /spl times/ 100 /spl mu/m in size. In conventional mode, echo signals received from a plane reflector at 5 mm had 70% fractional bandwidth around a center frequency of 8.3 MHz. In collapse mode, 69% fractional bandwidth is measured around 19 MHz. Measured signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the echo averaged 16 times was 29 dB for conventional operation and 35 dB for collapse mode. B-scans were generated of a target consisting of steel wires 0.3 mm in diameter to determine resolution performance. The 6 dB axial and lateral resolutions for the B-scan of the wire target are 189 /spl mu/m and 0.112 radians for 8 MHz, and 78 /spl mu/m and 0.051 radians for 19 MHz.

But among the unmanaged schemes, uniform sampling, in which a new measurement is requested periodically and regularly, is the most commonly-used sampling scheme; deliberately nonuniform schemes are seldom given serious consideration. In this paper, however, we show that such schemes may have been discarded prematurely: a nonuniform sampling can have its benefits. Specifically, the nonuniform and uniform sampling schemes are compared for two kind of trackers: the probabilistic data association filter (PDAF), which updates its track based on a single scan of information at a time; and N-D assignment (an optimization-based implementation of the multi-hypothesis tracker (MHT)), in which the sliding window involves many scans of observations. We find that given the ground rule of maintenance of the same overall scan rate (i.e., the same sensor effort) uniform sampling is always optimal for the single-scan tracker in the sense of track life. However, nonuniform sampling can outperform uniform sampling if a more sophisticated multi-scan tracker is used, particularly when 1) the target has a high process noise, and/or 2) the false alarm density is high, and/or 3) the probability of detection is high.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2006.1642559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2006.1642559","startPage":"388","endPage":"400","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/34423/01642559.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uniform versus nonuniform sampling when tracking in clutter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April 2006","displayDocTitle":"Uniform versus nonuniform sampling when tracking in clutter","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2006","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","volume":"42","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1642559/","accessionNumber":"8982498","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1642559/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uniform versus nonuniform sampling when tracking in clutter","sourcePdf":"01642559.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044565S","chronDate":"April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"34423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"34423","articleId":"1642559","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1642562,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenfang Li","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/34423/1642562/1642562-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhenfang Li received the B.S. degree in automatization and the M.S. degree in electronic information engineering from Xidian University, China, in 1999 and 2001, respectively.","He is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in radar signal processing at the National Lab of Radar Signal Processing at Xidian University.

In this implementation, several formation-flying small satellites cooperate to perform multiple space missions. We investigate the possibility to produce high-resolution wide-area SAR images and fine ground moving-target indicator (GMTI) performance with constellation of small spaceborne SAR systems. In particular, we focus on the problems introduced by this particular SAR system, such as Doppler ambiguities, high sparseness of the satellite array, and array element errors. A space-time adaptive processing (STAP) approach combined with conventional SAR imaging algorithms is proposed which can solve these problems to some extent. The main idea of the approach is to use a STAP-based method to properly overcome the aliasing effect caused by the lower pulse-repetition frequency (PRF) and thereby retrieve the unambiguous azimuth wide (full) spectrum signals from the received echoes. Following this operation, conventional SAR data processing tools can be applied to focus the SAR images fully. The proposed approach can simultaneously achieve both high-resolution SAR mapping of wide ground scenes and GMTI with high efficiency. To obtain array element errors, an array auto-calibration technique is proposed to estimate them based on the angular and Doppler ambiguity analysis of the clutter echo. The optimizing of satellite formations is also analyzed, and a platform velocity/PRF criterion for array configurations is presented. An approach is given to make it possible that almost any given sparse array configuration can satisfy the criterion by slightly adjusting the PRF. Simulated results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance improvement for constellation SAR using signal processing techniques","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2006.1642562","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/34423/01642562.pdf","startPage":"436","endPage":"452","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2006.1642562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34423","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1642562","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1642562/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 2006","displayDocTitle":"Performance improvement for constellation SAR using signal processing techniques","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1642562/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","publicationDate":"April 2006","accessionNumber":"8982501","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance improvement for constellation SAR using signal processing techniques","sourcePdf":"01642562.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113823S","chronDate":"April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"34423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"34423","articleId":"1642562","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-01"},{"_id":1642564,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Li","affiliation":["Oakland University, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/34423/1642564/1642564-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jia Li (M'02) received the B.S. degree in electronics and information systems from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 1996, the M.S.E. degree and the Ph.D. degree both in electrical engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 1997 and 2002.","Dr. Li is an Assistant Professor of Engineering with Oakland University, Rochester, MI.

We present a novel formulation of the PCRLB in which we initially determine a bound conditional on the sequence of measurements available. We then create an unconditional bound as a weighted average of these conditional PCRLBs. This new bound is proven to be less optimistic than the standard formulation of the PCRLB for cluttered environments recently developed (Zhang and Willett, 2001 and Hernandez et al., 2002) and will therefore better predict optimal estimator performance. At each stage, the conditional PCRLB must evaluate the effect of the uncertain measurements, and we extend previous work (Hernandez et al., 2002) to show that the measurement origin uncertainty manifests itself as a single information reduction factor (IRF) that is dependent on the number of measurements available. We also present some useful approximations when the false alarm rate is low. Simulations then consider the problems of 1) determining the CRLB for the point of impact of a ballistic missile, and 2) determining the PCRLB for tracking a nearly constant-velocity (NCV) target in a high clutter environment. In each case, we compare the new bound with the standard approach, and as expected the new CRLB/PCRLB can be seen to be less optimistic. Moreover, in case 1) we compare the new CRLB with a heuristic bound specially constructed for this problem, and a maximum likelihood estimator (MLC). The new bound both compares favorably with the heuristic bound, and shows close agreement with the performance of the MLE. The new bound is therefore an accurate predictor of filter performance in this case. In example 2) we demonstrate some interesting features of the new theory. Of particular interest we determine both precisely when the new bound will be significantly greater than the standard bound and when the two bounds will be virtually identical. This is useful in determining when the new approach, with its greater computational burden, should be preferred to the established approach. We conclude that the novel PCRLB formulation introduced herein represents an exciting development in the determination of RMSE performance bounds in cluttered environments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PCRLB for tracking in cluttered environments: measurement sequence conditioning approach","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2006.1642582","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/34423/01642582.pdf","startPage":"680","endPage":"704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2006.1642582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34423","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1642582","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1642582/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 2006","displayDocTitle":"PCRLB for tracking in cluttered environments: measurement sequence conditioning approach","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1642582/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","publicationDate":"April 2006","accessionNumber":"8982521","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PCRLB for tracking in cluttered environments: measurement sequence conditioning approach","sourcePdf":"01642582.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097282S","chronDate":"April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"34423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"34423","articleId":"1642582","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1642643,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Ever since, several clustering and merging algorithms have been proposed and individually reported to be efficient. However, it is not clear how effective they are and how well they compare against single-step scheduling algorithms or other multistep algorithms. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of the two-phase decomposition of scheduling and describe efficient and novel techniques that aggressively streamline interprocessor communications and can be tuned to exploit the significantly longer compilation time that is available to embedded system designers. We evaluate a number of leading clustering and merging algorithms using a set of benchmarks with diverse structures. We present an experimental setup for comparing the single-step against the two-step scheduling approach. We determine the importance of different steps in scheduling and the effect of different steps on overall schedule performance and show that the decomposition of the scheduling process indeed improves the overall performance. We also show that the quality of the solutions depends on the quality of the clusters generated in the clustering step. Based on the results, we also discuss why the parallel time metric in the clustering step may not provide an accurate measure for the final performance of cluster-scheduling","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2006.87","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/34426/01642643.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2006.87","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34426","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","startPage":"667","endPage":"680","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient techniques for clustering and scheduling onto embedded multiprocessors","volume":"17","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/1642643/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9024109","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1642643/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient techniques for clustering and scheduling onto embedded multiprocessors","sourcePdf":"01642643.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062381S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"34426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"34426","articleId":"1642643","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1642656,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Each of these algorithms is tuned to a specific type of data distribution (that which best models the problem at hand). Unfortunately, in most problems the form of each class pdf is a priori unknown, and the selection of the DA algorithm that best fits our data is done over trial-and-error. Ideally, one would like to have a single formulation which can be used for most distribution types. This can be achieved by approximating the underlying distribution of each class with a mixture of Gaussians. In this approach, the major problem to be addressed is that of determining the optimal number of Gaussians per class, i.e., the number of subclasses. In this paper, two criteria able to find the most convenient division of each class into a set of subclasses are derived. Extensive experimental results are shown using five databases.

In addition to these specifications, exoskeleton haptic interface design involves consideration of space and weight limitations, workspace requirements, and the kinematic constraints placed on the device by the human arm. These constraints impose conflicting design requirements on the engineer attempting to design an arm exoskeleton. In this paper, the authors present a detailed review of the requirements and constraints that are involved in the design of a high-quality haptic arm exoskeleton. In this context, the design of a five-degree-of-freedom haptic arm exoskeleton for training and rehabilitation in virtual environments is presented. The device is capable of providing kinesthetic feedback to the joints of the lower arm and wrist of the operator, and will be used in future work for robot-assisted rehabilitation and training. Motivation for such applications is based on findings that show robot-assisted physical therapy aids in the rehabilitation process following neurological injuries. As a training tool, the device provides a means to implement flexible, repeatable, and safe training methodologies.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2006.875558","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/34429/01642690.pdf","startPage":"280","endPage":"289","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2006.875558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a haptic arm exoskeleton for training and rehabilitation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1642690","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1642690/","displayDocTitle":"Design of a haptic arm exoskeleton for training and rehabilitation","volume":"11","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"8980026","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1642690/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a haptic arm exoskeleton for training and rehabilitation","sourcePdf":"01642690.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07617S","chronDate":"June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"34429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"221","xplore-issue":"34429","articleId":"1642690","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1642691,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Lu Murphey","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Dearborn, Dearborn, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/34429/1642691/1642691-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yi Lu Murphey (S'85\u2013M'88\u2013SM'97) received the M.S. degree in computer science from Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, in 1983 and the Ph.D. degree in computer, information, and control engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 1989.","She was a Research Scientist at the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

In this paper, we present a model-based fault diagnostics system developed using a machine learning technology for detecting and locating multiple classes of faults in an electric drive. Power electronics inverter can be considered to be the weakest link in such a system from hardware failure point of view; hence, this work is focused on detecting faults and finding which switches in the inverter cause the faults. A simulation model has been developed based on the theoretical foundations of electric drives to simulate the normal condition, all single-switch and post-short-circuit faults. A machine learning algorithm has been developed to automatically select a set of representative operating points in the (torque, speed) domain, which in turn is sent to the simulated electric drive model to generate signals for the training of a diagnostic neural network, fault diagnostic neural network (FDNN). We validated the capability of the FDNN on data generated by an experimental bench setup. Our research demonstrates that with a robust machine learning approach, a diagnostic system can be trained based on a simulated electric drive model, which can lead to a correct classification of faults over a wide operating domain.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2006.875568","startPage":"290","endPage":"303","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/34429/01642691.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2006.875568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-based fault diagnosis in electric drives using machine learning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Machine learning","Power system modeling","Inverters","Electrical fault detection","Neural networks","Electric motors","Electronics industry","Automotive engineering","Power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric drives","learning (artificial intelligence)","invertors","neural nets","electric motors","fault location","hybrid electric vehicles","machine vector control","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model-based fault diagnosis","electric drives","machine learning","power electronics inverter","fault diagnostic neural network","electric motor","fault location","fault detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electric drives","electric vehicle","field-oriented control (FOC)","fuzzy techniques","hybrid vehicle","inverter","machine learning","model-based diagnostics","motor","neural network","power electronics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1642691/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Model-based fault diagnosis in electric drives using machine learning","volume":"11","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1642691/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","accessionNumber":"8980027","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-based fault diagnosis in electric drives using machine learning","sourcePdf":"01642691.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085555S","chronDate":"June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"34429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"34429","articleId":"1642691","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1642694,"authors":[{"name":"Chee Khiang Pang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore","A*STAR Data Storage Institute, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/34429/1642694/1642694-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chee Khiang Pang (S'04) was born in Singapore in 1976.

In this letter, first a more robust learning algorithm for an MNN-based on unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is derived. Since it gives a more accurate estimate of the linkweights, the convergence performance is improved. The algorithm is then extended further to develop a NN-aided UKF for nonlinear state estimation. The NN in this algorithm is used to approximate the uncertainty of the system model due to mismodeling, extreme nonlinearities, etc. The UKF is used for both NN online training and state estimation simultaneously.

The basic idea is that it instructs a transmitter to increase its power when the channel is good and to decrease its power when the channel is bad. The transmission rate is adjusted according to the received signal-to-interference ratio. The proposed algorithm is distributed and can be applied to systems in which the transmitters are connected to different receivers. We prove that the algorithm always converge to a unique fixed point and thus is stable. Simulation results show that a tremendous increase in system capacity can be achieved, when compared with other power control algorithms. Furthermore, the algorithm works well for nonreal-time terminals when other real-time terminals employ the target-tracking power control.

Although the proof-of-concept was given decades ago, the reliable translation of user intent into device control commands is still a major challenge. Success requires the effective interaction of two adaptive controllers: the user's brain, which produces brain activity that encodes intent, and the BCI system, which translates that activity into device control commands. In order to facilitate this interaction, many laboratories are exploring a variety of signal analysis techniques to improve the adaptation of the BCI system to the user. In the literature, many machine learning and pattern classification algorithms have been reported to give impressive results when applied to BCI data in offline analyses. However, it is more difficult to evaluate their relative value for actual online use. BCI data competitions have been organized to provide objective formal evaluations of alternative methods. Prompted by the great interest in the first two BCI Competitions, we organized the third BCI Competition to address several of the most difficult and important analysis problems in BCI research. The paper describes the data sets that were provided to the competitors and gives an overview of the results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/34432/01642757.pdf","startPage":"153","endPage":"159","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2006.875642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2006.875642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34432","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1642757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The BCI competition III: validating alternative approaches to actual BCI problems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Brain computer interfaces","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Laboratories","Signal analysis","Machine learning","Pattern classification","Classification algorithms","Machine learning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","handicapped aids","medical control systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","medical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain-computer interface","BCI","brain activity","device control commands","adaptive controllers","signal analysis","machine learning","pattern classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Augmentative communication","beta rhythm","brain\u2013computer interface (BCI)","electroencephalography (EEG)","ERP","imagined hand movements","mu rhythm","nonstationarity","P300","rehabilitation","single-trial classification","slow cortical potentials"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Brain","Communication Aids for Disabled","Databases, Factual","Electroencephalography","Evoked Potentials","Humans","Neuromuscular Diseases","Software Validation","Technology Assessment, Biomedical","User-Computer Interface"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1642757/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"The BCI competition III: validating alternative approaches to actual BCI problems","volume":"14","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1642757/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"8982130","pubMedId":"16792282","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The BCI competition III: validating alternative approaches to actual BCI problems","sourcePdf":"01642757.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113462S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"34432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"540","xplore-issue":"34432","articleId":"1642757","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":1642762,"authors":[{"name":"A.D.

A target image in a sequence of nontarget distractor images elicits in the EEG a stereotypical spatiotemporal response, which can be detected. A pattern classifier uses this response to reprioritize the image sequence, placing detected targets in the front of an image stack. We use single-trial analysis based on linear discrimination to recover spatial components that reflect differences in EEG activity evoked by target versus nontarget images. We find an optimal set of spatial weights for 59 EEG sensors within a sliding 50-ms time window. Using this simple classifier allows us to process EEG in real time. The detection accuracy across five subjects is on average 92%, i.e., in a sequence of 2500 images, resorting images based on detector output results in 92% of target images being moved from a random position in the sequence to one of the first 250 images (first 10% of the sequence). The approach leverages the highly robust and invariant object recognition capabilities of the human visual system, using single-trial EEG analysis to efficiently detect neural signatures correlated with the recognition event.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/34432/01642762.pdf","startPage":"174","endPage":"179","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2006.875550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2006.875550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34432","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1642762","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cortically coupled computer vision for rapid image search","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer vision","Electroencephalography","Real time systems","Brain computer interfaces","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Image sequences","Image analysis","Detectors","Robustness","Object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","handicapped aids","neurophysiology","computer vision","image sequences","spatiotemporal phenomena","pattern classification","object recognition","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cortically coupled computer vision","rapid image search","real-time electroencephalography-based brain-computer interface system","EEG","rapid serial visual presentation","image sequence","stereotypical spatiotemporal response","pattern classifier","single-trial analysis","object recognition","neural signatures","50 ms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Brain\u2013computer interface (BCI)","cortically coupled computer vision","electroencephalography (EEG)","image triage","rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Biomedical Research","Biomimetics","Electroencephalography","Evoked Potentials, Visual","Female","Humans","Male","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Pattern Recognition, Visual","User-Computer Interface","Visual Cortex"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1642762/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Cortically coupled computer vision for rapid image search","volume":"14","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1642762/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"8982135","pubMedId":"16792287","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cortically coupled computer vision for rapid image search","sourcePdf":"01642762.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159532S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"34432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"155","xplore-issue":"34432","articleId":"1642762","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1642763,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.

During the center-out task, the subjects held their hands at the location of a central target and then reached to one of eight peripheral targets forming the corners of a virtual cube. The spectral amplitudes of the recorded LFPs were calculated, with the high-frequency LFP (HF-LFP) defined as the average spectral amplitude change from baseline from 60 to 200 Hz. A 3-D linear regression across the eight center-out targets revealed that approximately 6% of the beta LFPs (18-26 Hz) and 18% of the HF-LFPs were tuned for velocity (p-value <0.05), while 10% of the beta LFPs and 15% of the HF-LFPs were tuned for position. These results suggest that a multidegree-of-freedom brain-machine interface is possible using high-frequency LFP recordings in motor cortex.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1642763/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","volume":"14","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"8982136","pubMedId":"16792288","publicationDate":"June 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1642763/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Local field potential spectral tuning in motor cortex during reaching","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local field potential spectral tuning in motor cortex during reaching","sourcePdf":"01642763.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068863S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"34432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"34432","articleId":"1642763","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1642765,"authors":[{"name":"A.

By converting neural activity recorded in one brain area into electrical stimuli delivered to another site, the Neurochip BCI could form the basis for a simple, direct neural prosthetic. In tests with normal, unrestrained monkeys, the Neurochip continuously recorded activity of single neurons in primary motor cortex for several weeks at a time. Cortical activity was correlated with simultaneously-recorded electromyogram (EMG) activity from arm muscles during free behavior. In separate experiments with anesthetized monkeys, we found that microstimulation of the cervical spinal cord evoked movements of the arm and hand, often involving multiple muscles synergies. These observations suggest that spinal microstimulation controlled by cortical neurons could help compensate for damaged corticospinal projections.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/34432/01642765.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"190","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2006.875547","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2006.875547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34432","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1642765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The neurochip BCI: towards a neural prosthesis for upper limb function","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prosthetics","Neurons","Muscles","Computer interfaces","Electrodes","Nervous system","Brain","Testing","Electromyography","Spinal cord"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain","handicapped aids","prosthetics","neuromuscular stimulation","electrodes","bioelectric phenomena","biomechanics","medical computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Neurochip BCI","neural prosthesis","upper limb function","autonomously operating interface","implanted computer chip","recording electrodes","stimulating electrodes","nervous system","neural activity","electrical stimuli","normal unrestrained monkey","neurons","electromyogram","arm muscles","cervical spinal cord evoked movements","multiple muscles synergies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Brain\u2013computer interface (BCI)","motor cortex","neural prosthetics","spinal cord injury"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Animals","Brain","Electric Stimulation Therapy","Electric Stimulation Therapy","Equipment Design","Equipment Failure Analysis","Evoked Potentials","Haplorhini","Humans","Motor Cortex","Movement Disorders","Movement Disorders","Muscle, Skeletal","Muscle, Skeletal","Pyramidal Tracts","Therapy, Computer-Assisted","Therapy, Computer-Assisted","Upper Extremity","Upper Extremity","User-Computer Interface"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1642765/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"The neurochip BCI: towards a neural prosthesis for upper limb function","volume":"14","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1642765/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"8982138","pubMedId":"16792290","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The neurochip BCI: towards a neural prosthesis for upper limb function","sourcePdf":"01642765.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04404S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"34432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"34432","articleId":"1642765","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1642776,"authors":[{"name":"T.M.

We have also improved P300-based BCI operation. We are now translating this laboratory-proven BCI technology into a system that can be used by severely disabled people in their homes with minimal ongoing technical oversight. To accomplish this, we have: improved our general-purpose BCI software (BCI2000); improved online adaptation and feature translation for SMR-based BCI operation; improved the accuracy and bandwidth of P300-based BCI operation; reduced the complexity of system hardware and software and begun to evaluate home system use in appropriate users.

We have previously proposed two novel methods on time-frequency feature extraction, expression and classification for high-density EEG recordings (Wang and He 2004; Wang, Deng, and He, 2004). In the present study, we refined the above time-frequency-spatial approach and applied it to a one-dimensional \"cursor control\" BCI experiment with online feedback. Through offline analysis of the collected data, we evaluated the capability of the present refined method in comparison with the original time-frequency-spatial methods.

The 57 mm times 12 mm sized conductor is a Rutherford cable with NbTi-Cu strands co-extruded with a high purity aluminum stabilizer. The race track coils have overall dimensions of 25 m times 5 m and the length of the conductor in the windings is 6.7 km. The coils are conduction cooled with forced flow helium. The nominal operating current is 20.5 kA and the nominal ramp rate is 4 A/s. During the test program of the individual coils the ramp losses are measured to confirm that they do not exceed the design cooling capacity of the ATLAS cryogenic system. The losses are determined from the amount of evaporated helium in the return flow. The ramp losses in the conductor consist of the hysteresis and coupling current losses in the Rutherford cable and eddy current loss in the pure aluminum stabilizer. Ohmic losses are generated in the coil casing which acts as a low resistive secondary of a transformer formed by the coil and the casing. In this paper the results of the loss measurements on the different coils, with different RRR (residual resistance ratio), are presented. Measurements are performed at various ramp rates. The results are in good agreement with the calculated losses, which are dominated by the loss in the coil casing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1642908/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1642908/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"9069733","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical and Experimental Investigation of the Ramp Losses in Conductor and Coil Casing of the ATLAS Barrel Toroid Coils","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical and Experimental Investigation of the Ramp Losses in Conductor and Coil Casing of the ATLAS Barrel Toroid Coils","sourcePdf":"01642908.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063117S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"77","isNumber":"34433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"34433","articleId":"1642908","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1642942,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The transformer type superconducting fault current limiter is one of the fault current limiters, and has many advantages such as design flexibility. By using an experimental fault current limiter, the short-circuit fault test was carried out for different fault phase angles. From the results of the experiments, it is confirmed that the transmission line fault current is seriously affected by the magnetic saturation of the transformer core. This has to be considered in the design of the transformer. Thus, in this paper, the transient characteristics of the transformer type super-conducting fault current limiter are analyzed by the numerical simulation considering the magnetic saturation of the transformer iron core and the time-dependent resistance of the current limiting device.

The magnet is composed of two coaxial NbTi solenoid coils with identical axial length. Clear bore of the magnet is phi 226 mm. The magnet is installed in a vacuum cryostat with a phi 100 mm room temperature bore. The cryostat is designed in a support frame to be rotatable in a horizontal or vertical direction. A two-stage 4 K Gifford-McMahon (GM) cryocooler is used to cool down the superconducting magnet from room temperature to 4 K. The cooling power of the 4 K cold head is 1 W. A pair of Bi-2223 high temperature superconducting current leads was employed to reduce heat leakage into 4 K cold mass. Total cold mass of the superconducting magnet is about 115 kg. It takes 82 hours to cool down the magnet from 300 K to 4 K directly through the cryocooler. The superconducting magnet reached the designed central magnetic field of 6 T in the warm bore when a 115 A energizing current is applied.

It is based on the fundamental hydro- and thermodynamic conservation equations and the equation of gas state taking into account melting and evaporation of metals as well as chemical reactions with the surrounding gas. With respect to the dependence of the arc energy on gas density, the radiative effect of fault arcs on the energy balance is introduced. In consideration of the radiation, the more reasonable arc energy is applied for the estimation of the gas temperature and of the thermal transfer coefficient in the energy balance. In order to identify conveniently which factors essentially influence the development of pressure, the thermal transfer coefficient is studied and evaluated as an alternative variable of the gas pressure.

Among these algorithms is a class of adaptive spatial filters known as beamformers, which have superior spatiotemporal resolution abilities. The performance of beamformers is robust to weakly coherent sources. However, these algorithms are extremely sensitive to the presence of strongly coherent sources. A frequent mode of failure in beamformers occurs with reconstruction of auditory evoked fields (AEFs), in which bilateral auditory cortices are highly coherent in their activation. Here, we present a novel beamformer that suppresses activation from regions with interfering coherent sources. First, a volume containing the interfering sources is defined. The lead field matrix for this volume is computed and reduced into a few significant columns using singular value decomposition (SVD). A vector beamformer is then constructed by rejecting the contribution of sources in the suppression region while allowing for source reconstruction at other specified regions. Performance of this algorithm was first validated with simulated data. Subsequent tests of this modified beamformer were performed on bilateral AEF data. An unmodified vector beamformer using whole head coverage misplaces the source medially. After defining a suppression region containing the temporal cortex on one side, the described method consistently results in clear focal activations at expected regions of the contralateral superior temporal plane.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2006.873752","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/34439/01643404.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2006.873752","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","startPage":"1357","endPage":"1363","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified beamformers for coherent source region suppression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1643404","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Modified beamformers for coherent source region suppression","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1643404/","volume":"53","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/1643404/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"8990651","pubMedId":"16830939","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified beamformers for coherent source region suppression","sourcePdf":"01643404.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051266S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"34439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"34439","articleId":"1643404","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1643405,"authors":[{"name":"K.G.

The approach is based on exploiting the temporal and spatial characteristics of the neural recordings in order to strip the redundancy and infer the useful information early in the data stream. The proposed signal processing algorithms augment current filtering and amplification capability and may be a viable replacement to on chip spike detection and sorting currently employed to remedy the bandwidth limitations. Temporal processing is devised by exploiting the sparseness capabilities of the discrete wavelet transform, while spatial processing exploits the reduction in the number of physical channels through quasi-periodic eigendecomposition of the data covariance matrix. Our results demonstrate that substantial improvements are obtained in terms of lower transmission bandwidth, reduced latency and optimized processor utilization. We also demonstrate the improvements qualitatively in terms of superior denoising capabilities and higher fidelity of the obtained signals.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2006.873749","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/34439/01643405.pdf","startPage":"1364","endPage":"1377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2006.873749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34439","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A systems approach for data compression and latency reduction in cortically controlled brain machine interfaces","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1643405","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1643405/","displayDocTitle":"A systems approach for data compression and latency reduction in cortically controlled brain machine interfaces","volume":"53","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"8990652","pubMedId":"16830940","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1643405/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A systems approach for data compression and latency reduction in cortically controlled brain machine interfaces","sourcePdf":"01643405.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070192S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"34439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"34439","articleId":"1643405","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1643413,"authors":[{"name":"Po-Ching Chen","affiliation":["Laboratory of Biophysics, Department of Research and Education, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Po-Ching Chen","id":"38045750200"},{"name":"S.

MDO was employed to automatically categorize the T wave into one of the three categories of T wave morphologies and to improve the precision of T wave delineation for each category. The new algorithm was evaluated on QT database (QTDB) and new annotations of 2160 beats from QTDB were performed by two cardiologists. To evaluate the performance of the wave delineation, the time differences between automatic detection versus cardiologists' annotations and intercardiologist differences were measured. The new algorithm can attain better results than the previous methods by achieving the smallest standard deviation of the differences and qualifying the strict error criterion for T-off measurement. This new algorithm also exhibited excellent T wave categorization agreement with the cardiologists, resulting in kappa values above 0.75.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/34439/01643413.pdf","startPage":"1429","endPage":"1433","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2006.875719","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2006.875719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34439","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1643413","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delineation of T-wave in ECG by wavelet transform using multiscale differential operator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Wavelet transforms","Cardiology","Hospitals","Morphology","Shape","Signal analysis","Signal processing","Biophysics","Biomedical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrocardiography","wavelet transforms","medical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["T-wave delineation","ECG","electrocardiogram","wavelet transform","multiscale differential operator","QT database","strict error criterion","T wave morphology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electrocardiography","multiscale differential operator","T wave","wavelet"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Arrhythmias, Cardiac","Arrhythmias, Cardiac","Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted","Electrocardiography","Humans","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1643413/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Delineation of T-wave in ECG by wavelet transform using multiscale differential operator","volume":"53","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/1643413/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"8990660","pubMedId":"16830948","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delineation of T-wave in ECG by wavelet transform using multiscale differential operator","sourcePdf":"01643413.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074571S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"34439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"34439","articleId":"1643413","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1643430,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Hsin Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/34440/1643430/1643430-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei-Hsin Chang (S'01) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and the M.S degree in electronics engineering from National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., and National Chiao Tung University, HsinChu, Taiwan, R.O.C. in 1999 and 2001, respectively.

Since turbo decoding is classified as a memory-intensive algorithm, reducing memory accesses is crucial to achieve a low power design. To reduce the number of memory accesses for maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding, this paper proposes an approximate reverse calculation method that can be implemented with simple arithmetic operations such as addition and comparison. Simulation results show that the proposed method applied to the W-CDMA standard reduces the access rate of the backward metric memory by 87% without degrading error-correcting performance.

It is also efficient for the implementation of quadrature mirror filter (QMF), because the perfect reconstruction is preserved under the coefficient quantization. Moreover, if lattice coefficients are implemented in signed powers-of-two (SPT), the hardware complexity can also be reduced. But the discrete coefficient space with the SPT representation is sparse when the number of nonzero bits is small. This paper proposes a structure of orthogonal QMF lattice with SPT coefficients, which has much denser discrete coefficient space than the conventional structure. While the conventional approaches directly quantize the lattice coefficients into SPT form, the proposed algorithm considers the quantization in the SPT angle space. For this, each lattice stage is implemented by the cascade of several variants of COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer. The resulting angle space and corresponding discrete coefficient space is much denser than the one generated by the conventional direct quantization approach. An efficient coefficient search algorithm for this structure is also proposed. Since the proposed architecture provides denser coefficient space, it shows less coefficient quantization error than the conventional QMF lattice","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2006.870478","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/34440/01643432.pdf","startPage":"1254","endPage":"1265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2006.870478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of signed powers-of-two coefficient perfect reconstruction QMF Bank using CORDIC algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1643432/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","displayDocTitle":"Design of signed powers-of-two coefficient perfect reconstruction QMF Bank using CORDIC algorithms","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1643432/","accessionNumber":"8954896","volume":"53","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of signed powers-of-two coefficient perfect reconstruction QMF Bank using CORDIC algorithms","sourcePdf":"01643432.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119262S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"34440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"34440","articleId":"1643432","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1643434,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The method requires that the input signal should be slightly oversampled. This ensures that there exists a frequency band around the zero frequency where the Fourier transforms of the ADC subchannels are alias free. Low-pass filtering the ADC subchannels to this alias-free band reduces the blind calibration problem to a conventional gain and time delay estimation problem for an unknown signal in noise. An adaptive filtering structure with three fixed FIR filters and two adaptive gain and delay parameters is employed to achieve the calibration. A convergence analysis is presented for the blind calibration technique.

When the neural networks have small state feedback coefficients, it is shown further that the infimum of exponential bounds of the trajectories of the neural networks equals exactly the spectral radius of Jacobian matrix of the neural networks at the unique equilibrium point.

Since the SRWNN has a self-recurrent mother wavelet layer, it can well attract the complex nonlinear system although the SRWNN has less mother wavelet nodes than the wavelet neural network. Thus, the SRWNN is used as a model identifier for approximating on-line the states of the mobile robot. In our control system, since the control inputs, as well as the parameters of the SRWNN identifier are trained by the gradient descent method with the adaptive learning rates (ALRs), the optimal learning rates which are suitable for the time-varying trajectory of the mobile robot can be found rapidly. The ALRs for training the parameters of the SRWNN identifier and those for learning the control inputs are derived from the discrete Lyapunov stability theorem, which are used to guarantee the convergence of the GPC system. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1643444/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8954908","volume":"53","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1643444/","publicationDate":"June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Generalized predictive control based on self-recurrent wavelet neural network for stable path tracking of mobile robots: adaptive learning rates approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized predictive control based on self-recurrent wavelet neural network for stable path tracking of mobile robots: adaptive learning rates approach","sourcePdf":"01643444.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099789S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"34440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"34440","articleId":"1643444","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1643446,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Current biasing of the LSB ladder addresses this issue by employing active circuitry. We propose an inverted ladder DAC, where an MSB ladder slides upon two static LSB ladders.

The drain-currents of the fabricated AlGaN/GaN HFETs with various gate directions do not depend on the gate orientation, whereas those of GaAs-based HFETs strongly depend on the gate direction due to the piezoelectric charges induced around the gate electrode. The piezoelectric charges induced in the vicinity of the gate electrode are simulated by using a finite-element method. This simulation solves the piezoelectric equations with piezoelectric and elastic stiffness constants, assuming that stress is applied to the gate edges in the HFET. The detailed simulation reveals that the piezoelectric charge distribution does not depend on the gate direction, although a large amount of piezoelectric charges is induced in the vicinity of the gate edges, which is consistent with the experimental result. Moreover, it is mathematically clarified that these experimental and simulated results are due to the symmetry characteristic of the piezoelectric and elastic stiffness constants for nitride semiconductor materials","doi":"10.1109/TED.2006.876398","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/34442/01643483.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2006.876398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34442","startPage":"1524","endPage":"1529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental and theoretical examination of orientation effect on piezoelectric charge at gate periphery in AlGaN/GaN HFETs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1643483","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Experimental and theoretical examination of orientation effect on piezoelectric charge at gate periphery in AlGaN/GaN HFETs","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1643483/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"8951507","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1643483/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental and theoretical examination of orientation effect on piezoelectric charge at gate periphery in AlGaN/GaN HFETs","sourcePdf":"01643483.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089193S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"34442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"34442","articleId":"1643483","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1643484,"authors":[{"name":"Chien-Chung Hung","affiliation":["Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), Hsinchu, Taiwan","Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/34442/1643484/1643484-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chien-Chung Hung was born in Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1971.

The improvement in capacity, however, depends on the degree of completeness of the channel quality information (CQI) fed back from the receiver to the transmitter. To be motivated by an insight that too many CQI feedbacks may rather impair the capacity gain, due to causing congestion in feedback link, this letter proposes a quality-based CQI reporting (QBR) scheme where the CQIs are fed back to the transmitter only for receivers whose signal quality is above a predefined threshold. The capacity is provided in terms of the threshold and feedback-error rate. The results show that QBR achieves outstanding performance when the feedback error is present.

RRNS codes constitute maximum-minimum distance block codes, exhibiting identical distance properties to Reed-Solomon codes. Binary to RRNS symbol-mapping methods are proposed, in order to implement both systematic and nonsystematic RRNS codes.

The classic Chase algorithm achieving near-ML soft decoding is introduced for the first time for RRNS codes, in order to decrease the complexity of the ML soft decoding.

The general result is applicable to both symbol-based and bit-interleaved coded modulations, to HARQ processes based on rateless and fixed-rate mother codes, and IR schemes with and without a self-decodability restriction. The analysis shows that IR over CC coding gains tend to increase with the initial coding rate, but decrease with the signal-to-noise (SNR) variation between retransmissions. The gains can also be diminished when a fixed-rate mother code is used or when the self-decodability criterion is imposed. The theoretical prediction is compared with observed gains at 10% codeword error rates based on turbo-coding simulations. For scenarios with moderately varying SNR between retransmissions, the analytical model tracks actual simulation results very well. However, when the SNR varies widely and the systematic part of the turbo codeword is effectively erased, the CC scheme could, in fact, outperform some IR schemes. For these scenarios, which can be induced by fast time-varying fading or long retransmission delays, the self-decodable IR and the CC schemes prove to be more robust without much performance comprise.

By modeling the multipath fading channel with a complex bandpass autoregressive (AR) model, we show how the estimates for the frequency offset, Doppler spread, and power profile of the multipath channel can be extracted from the estimated complex AR coefficients obtained via the expectation-maximization algorithm. A main advantage of the proposed joint estimator is that while it has a capability of performing equally well in all scattering environments, it can provide accurate estimates even in high-mobility channel conditions. We also demonstrate how the complexity of the estimator can be significantly reduced, while only slightly trading off performance, by applying the mean field approximation technique. Moreover, we derive a fully adaptive joint synchronization and channel-estimation scheme, as well as a novel Kalman-smoother-based frequency-error detector that can be used in feedback frequency-recovery schemes and is particularly well suited for fast-fading channel conditions.

OFCDM is more attractive than orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) both by introducing frequency-domain spreading for frequency diversity provision and time-domain spreading for flexible data rate provision. To provide high-speed mobile services, multicode transmission is employed in conjunction with OFCDM. In a Gaussian or flat-fading channel, multicode channels are orthogonal. However, in a realistic wireless channel, the orthogonality no longer maintains. Thus, multicode interference (MCI) is caused. This paper focuses on the investigation of the effect of Doppler shift on the downlink transmission of high-speed mobile OFCDM systems. A practical channel estimation algorithm based on a code-multiplexed pilot channel is employed to track the variations of fading channels. Hybrid MCI cancellation and minimum mean-square error (MMSE) detection proposed by the authors is employed as an efficient way to eliminate the MCI in the frequency domain. The system performance is analytically studied with imperfect channel estimation to show how it is affected by parameters such as the window size in the channel estimation, Doppler shift, the number of stages of the hybrid detection, the power ratio of pilot to data channels, spreading factor, and so on","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2006.876872","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34443","startPage":"1097","endPage":"1108","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/34443/01643538.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink transmission of broadband OFCDM Systems-part II: effect of Doppler shift","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1643538/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1643538/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Downlink transmission of broadband OFCDM Systems-part II: effect of Doppler shift","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"8951988","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"54","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink transmission of broadband OFCDM Systems-part II: effect of Doppler shift","sourcePdf":"01643538.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059057S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"34443","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"34443","articleId":"1643538","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1643539,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Its bit-error rate (BER) performance has been studied mainly using numerical (Monte Carlo) techniques, since exact analytical evaluation presents serious difficulties. Close examination of the problem of BLAST BER performance analysis reveals that the major difficulty for analytical evaluation is due to the optimal ordering procedure. Hence, we analyze the algorithm performance without optimal ordering. While this is a disadvantage of the analysis, there are certain advantages as well. Exact closed-form analytical evaluation is possible for arbitrary number of transmit and receive antennas in an independent, identically distributed Rayleigh fading channel, which provides deep insight and understanding that cannot be gained using the Monte Carlo approach alone. A result on the maximum ratio combining weights, which is used at each detection step, is derived to obtain a number of results: independence of noise, distribution of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and block- or bit-error rates. We present a detailed analysis and expressions for uncoded error rates at each detection step, which hold true for any modulation format and take simple closed form in some cases.

Two notions of channel capacity limits are considered in this paper, including the ergodic capacity for transmission without delay constraint, and the delay-limited capacity for transmission under a strict delay constraint. With the full availability of CSI, a BF channel can be decomposed into multiple space-time-frequency subchannels, and is, therefore, considered in this paper as a vector BF channel. We propose a class of multitarget (MT) power-control schemes, which we show to be computationally implementable and able to perform well in approaching the capacity limits of vector BF channels. These power-control schemes are based on a subchannel grouping technique, which can be used to further divide subchannels in a vector BF channel into multiple grouped channels, each exhibiting different fading statistics. Each MT scheme then assigns a particular set of power \"targets\" into these grouped channels, and maximizes the transmission rate via various statistical waterfilling solutions.

We report the effects of the number of shells, diameter of the lens, and distance between the primary source and the lens on the input impedance, broadside directivity, and aperture efficiency. Thus, we show that aperture efficiencies up to 95% can be obtained for a one-wavelength-diameter lens with only three shells, justifying the interest in such lenses. An analytical optimization method is also proposed and detailed to choose the thickness and permittivity of a three-shell HMFE lens to approach the radial permittivity law as well as possible. Simulations of lens antennas whose shell characteristics are determined by various ways show that the optimized lens is the one that provides the highest broadside directivities. Finally, measurements done with a three-shell four-wavelength diameter lens fed by a 2 times 2 patch antenna array show the validity of these simulations.

However, due to practical limitations in the analog-to-digital conversion process, some analog signal processing stages are likely to remain also in the continuation. With the ever-increasing demands for the system performance and supported data rates on one side, and the terminal flexibility and implementation costs on the other, the requirements for these remaining analog front-end stages become extremely challenging to meet. Then, one interesting idea in this context is to apply sophisticated DSP-based techniques to compensate for some of the most fundamental nonidealities of the receiver analog front-ends. In this paper, we focus on developing and demonstrating novel digital techniques to mitigate the effects of harmonic and intermodulation distortion in wideband multicarrier or multichannel receivers using adaptive interference cancellation. The approach in general is practically oriented and largely based on analyzing and processing measured real-world receiver front-end signals. The obtained results indicate that the proposed compensation technique can be used to suppress nonlinear distortion due to receiver front-end sections under realistic signaling assumptions","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/34444/01643562.pdf","startPage":"2356","endPage":"2366","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2006.875274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2006.875274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34444","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1643562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced digital signal processing techniques for compensation of nonlinear distortion in wideband multicarrier radio receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital signal processing","Nonlinear distortion","Wideband","Receivers","Signal processing","Analog-digital conversion","System performance","Costs","Intermodulation distortion","Interference cancellation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","harmonic distortion","interference suppression","intermodulation distortion","radio receivers","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing techniques","nonlinear distortion","wideband multicarrier radio receivers","wireless device","analog-to-digital conversion process","analog signal processing","receiver analog front-ends","intermodulation distortion","multichannel receivers","adaptive interference cancellation","harmonic distortion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive filters","communication system nonlinearities","digital radios","harmonic and intermodulation distortion","radio receivers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1643562/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Advanced digital signal processing techniques for compensation of nonlinear distortion in wideband multicarrier radio receivers","volume":"54","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1643562/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"8951535","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced digital signal processing techniques for compensation of nonlinear distortion in wideband multicarrier radio receivers","sourcePdf":"01643562.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057572S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"34444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"34444","articleId":"1643562","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":1643567,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Cao","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/34444/1643567/1643567-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yi Cao (S'06) received the B.Eng. degree from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 1999 and the M.A.Sc. degree from Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada, in 2003, both in electrical engineering, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include computed-aided design of VLSI modules and applications of Artificial neural networks for high-frequency/high-speed circuit modeling and design.","Mr. Cao received the 2004 Carleton University Indira Gandhi Memorial Fellowship."]},"lastName":"Yi Cao","id":"37087614184"},{"name":"Runtao Ding","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/34444/1643567/1643567-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Runtao Ding was born in Shanghai, China, in 1938.

The proposed cold-mode HEMT linearizer can enhance the linearity of the power amplifier (PA) with a low insertion loss (IL<2 dB), a compact die-size, and no additional dc power consumption. These advantages make the linearizer more suitable for millimeter-wave (MMW) applications. The physical mechanism of the gain expansion characteristics of the proposed linearizer is analyzed. A systematic design procedure for a low-loss linearizer is developed, which includes: 1) insertion loss minimization through a device-size selection and 2) linearity optimization through a two-tone test. To demonstrate the general usefulness of the proposed linearizer, the linearizer was applied to a two-stage 44-GHz MMIC medium PA and a commercial MMW PA module. After linearization, the output spectrum regrowth is suppressed by 7-9 dB. To keep the adjacent channel power ratio below -40 dBc, the output power has been doubled from 15 to 18 dBm at 44 GHz. The error vector magnitude of the 16-quadrature amplitude modulation signal can be reduced from 6.11% to 3.87% after linearization.

In this hybrid TD-FD approach, one generates the early time response using a TD code at a spatial location and uses a FD code to generate the low-frequency response at the same place. Then, the partial complementary information in both the TD and FD is fit by a set of orthogonal functions and its Fourier transform having the same expansion coefficients. Three different types of functions, namely, Hermite, Bessel-Chebyshev, and Laguerre, have been used for extrapolation. Once the expansion coefficients for these functions are known, the response can be extrapolated either for late times or high frequencies using the initial partial information. The objective of this paper is to explore the conditions under which this hybrid approach yields a stable and accurate solution. We investigate bounds for both the number of orthogonal functions needed to carry out the extrapolation and the scale factors needed to accurately fit the data in time and in frequency. Numerical examples have been presented to illustrate the efficacy of these bounds. It is important to point out that, in this hybrid approach of extrapolation, we are not creating new information but processing the available information in an intelligent fashion","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2006.875823","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/34444/01643584.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2006.875823","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34444","startPage":"2552","endPage":"2563","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Conditions for generation of stable and accurate hybrid TD-FD MoM solutions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1643584","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Conditions for generation of stable and accurate hybrid TD-FD MoM solutions","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1643584/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"8951552","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1643584/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conditions for generation of stable and accurate hybrid TD-FD MoM solutions","sourcePdf":"01643584.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080289S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"34444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"34444","articleId":"1643584","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1643591,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Two microstrip implementations have been realized for measurements at 2.35 and 10 GHz, showing very good accuracy to be achieved in both frequency ranges.

From the bare-chip measurement, this new 90deg phase shifter has been proven with an amplitude and phase error less than 0.6 dB and 0.8deg, respectively, within the applied frequency range from 1.85 to 1.98 GHz. The package and printed circuit board (PCB) interconnects are also analyzed using the three-dimensional electromagnetic simulation tool and transformed into the equivalent-circuit elements for co-simulation with the designed quadrature modulator MMIC. The degradation of error vector magnitude and sideband suppression due to the package and PCB can be well predicted and verified by measurements. Although the proposed 90deg phase shifter has a remarkable advantage over the others in implementation loss, it is quite susceptible to the package and PCB effects and needs more design efforts to deal with those effects","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct-conversion quadrature modulator MMIC design with a new 90/spl deg/ phase shifter including package and PCB effects for W-CDMA applications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2006.874866","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/34445/01643605.pdf","startPage":"2691","endPage":"2698","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2006.874866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34445","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1643605","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1643605/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","displayDocTitle":"Direct-conversion quadrature modulator MMIC design with a new 90/spl deg/ phase shifter including package and PCB effects for W-CDMA applications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1643605/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"8951567","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct-conversion quadrature modulator MMIC design with a new 90/spl deg/ phase shifter including package and PCB effects for W-CDMA applications","sourcePdf":"01643605.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069345S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"34445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"34445","articleId":"1643605","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1643607,"authors":[{"name":"S.

We propose a method to design a decoupling and matching network for a three-element antenna array with a radiator separation of lambda/10, which additionally allows arbitrary beam patterns assigned to each port-subject to certain constraints.

Two different geometries (U-slot and V-slot) are investigated. U-slot and V-slot DGSs have simple shapes compared to the conventional DGSs, however, they provide more steep rejection characteristics. The Q factor of the band-rejection property for the U-slot DGS increases when the distance between two slots in the U-shape decreases. Similarly, the V-slot DGS provides a higher Q characteristic when the slot angle is reduced. Two bandstop filters are designed and fabricated employing three cascaded U-slot DGSs and V-slot DGSs, respectively. Experimental result shows that the high-Q band-rejection filter with three U-slot DGSs provides Q of 38.6.

It provides numerous advantages related to fabrication precision, design flexibility, and assembly cost, whereas it still retains the low-loss properties of its conventional counterpart in the millimeter-wave range. This is achieved by artificially lowering the effective dielectric permittivity around a guiding channel through cutting a periodic pattern of air holes in a single high-permittivity substrate. In this way, entire circuits including millimeter-wave components can be fabricated and assembled subsequently by a lamination process. Details on the propagation properties of the SIIG and design rules are presented. Two different simulation approaches, which have proven useful for analysis are described, and theoretical results are validated by measurements of fabricated prototypes.

However, more basic research is needed to increase the range and reliability of a passive RF tag's radio link, particularly when the RF tag is placed onto any lossy dielectric or metallic surface. This paper presents two new useful forms of the radio link budget that describe the power link of an RF tag system when the tag is attached to an object. These radio link budgets are dependent upon the gain penalty, a term which quantifies the reduction in RF tag antenna gain due to material attachment. A series of measurements, or radio assay, was used to measure the far-field gain pattern and gain penalty of several flexible 915 MHz antennas when attached to cardboard, pine plywood, acrylic, deionized water, ethylene glycol, ground beef, and an aluminum slab. It is shown that the gain penalty due to material attachment can result in more than 20 dB of excess loss in the backscatter communication link.","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2006.874072","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/33542/01643635.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2006.874072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33542","startPage":"247","endPage":"250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RF Tag Antenna Performance on Various Materials Using Radio Link Budgets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1643635","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"RF Tag Antenna Performance on Various Materials Using Radio Link Budgets","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1643635/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"8992573","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1643635/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RF Tag Antenna Performance on Various Materials Using Radio Link Budgets","sourcePdf":"05lawp01-griffin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046577S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"33542","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"33542","articleId":"1643635","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1643650,"authors":[{"name":"Jingdong Chen","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, Inc., Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Jingdong Chen","id":"37280669000"},{"name":"J.

Among the numerous techniques that were developed, the optimal Wiener filter can be considered as one of the most fundamental noise reduction approaches, which has been delineated in different forms and adopted in various applications. Although it is not a secret that the Wiener filter may cause some detrimental effects to the speech signal (appreciable or even significant degradation in quality or intelligibility), few efforts have been reported to show the inherent relationship between noise reduction and speech distortion. By defining a speech-distortion index to measure the degree to which the speech signal is deformed and two noise-reduction factors to quantify the amount of noise being attenuated, this paper studies the quantitative performance behavior of the Wiener filter in the context of noise reduction. We show that in the single-channel case the a posteriori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (defined after the Wiener filter) is greater than or equal to the a priori SNR (defined before the Wiener filter), indicating that the Wiener filter is always able to achieve noise reduction. However, the amount of noise reduction is in general proportional to the amount of speech degradation. This may seem discouraging as we always expect an algorithm to have maximal noise reduction without much speech distortion. Fortunately, we show that speech distortion can be better managed in three different ways. If we have some a priori knowledge (such as the linear prediction coefficients) of the clean speech signal, this a priori knowledge can be exploited to achieve noise reduction while maintaining a low level of speech distortion. When no a priori knowledge is available, we can still achieve a better control of noise reduction and speech distortion by properly manipulating the Wiener filter, resulting in a suboptimal Wiener filter. In case that we have multiple microphone sensors, the multiple observations of the speech signal can be used to reduce noise with less or even no speech distortion","doi":"10.1109/TSA.2005.860851","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/34446/01643650.pdf","startPage":"1218","endPage":"1234","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSA.2005.860851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New insights into the noise reduction Wiener filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1643650/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","displayDocTitle":"New insights into the noise reduction Wiener filter","volume":"14","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"8953277","htmlLink":"/document/1643650/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New insights into the noise reduction Wiener filter","sourcePdf":"01643650.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07683S","chronDate":"July  2006","isNumber":"34446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"306","articleId":"1643650","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":1643652,"authors":[{"name":"Jen-Tzung Chien","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/34446/1643652/1643652-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jen-Tzung Chien (S'97\u2013A'98\u2013M'99\u2013SM'04) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the National Tsing Hua University (NTHU), Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1997.","He was an Instructor in the Department of Electrical Engineering, NTHU, in 1995.

We accordingly estimate the demixing matrix by maximizing the likelihood ratio function and apply it to transform data into independent component space. Conventionally, the test of independence was established assuming data distributions being Gaussian, which is improper to realize ICA. To avoid assuming Gaussianity in hypothesis testing, we propose a nonparametric approach where the distributions of random variables are calculated using kernel density functions. A new ICA is then fulfilled through the NLR objective function. Interestingly, we apply the proposed NLR-ICA algorithm for unsupervised learning of unknown pronunciation variations. The clusters of speech hidden Markov models are estimated to characterize multiple pronunciations of subword units for robust speech recognition. Also, the NLR-ICA is applied to separate the linear mixture of speech and audio signals.

The core process in a voice morphing system is the transformation of the spectral envelope of the source speaker to match that of the target speaker and linear transformations estimated from time-aligned parallel training data are commonly used to achieve this. However, the naive application of envelope transformation combined with the necessary pitch and duration modifications will result in noticeable artifacts. This paper studies the linear transformation approach to voice morphing and investigates these two specific issues. First, a general maximum likelihood framework is proposed for transform estimation which avoids the need for parallel training data inherent in conventional least mean square approaches. Second, the main causes of artifacts are identified as being due to glottal coupling, unnatural phase dispersion and the high spectral variance of unvoiced sounds, and compensation techniques are developed to mitigate these. The resulting voice morphing system is evaluated using both subjective and objective measures. These tests show that the proposed approaches are capable of effectively transforming speaker identity whilst maintaining high quality.

This particular class of acoustical signals can be described as a set of harmonics, or partials, whose amplitude and frequency vary with time following a particular pattern. The interest in the correct measurement of these two magnitudes stems from the fact that they are widely used to extract more information about the production mechanisms of this vocal effect, and even the singing voice. Focusing on the estimation of these magnitudes from the signal processing point of view, the estimation of the IA and the IF of a partial represents a practical example for the more general problem of the AM-FM decomposition of a bandpass signal, which has received considerable attention by the Time-Frequency community. With this in mind, this work will investigate the most appropriate AM-FM decomposition of the partials, and how it is affected by the reverberation present in recordings. A mathematical description of the effect of reverberation on the measurement will be given. It will be shown that the measurement of the IA and the IF of the partials will be corrupted by reverberation regardless of the employed estimation method","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSA.2005.858015","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/34446/01643666.pdf","startPage":"1413","endPage":"1421","doi":"10.1109/TSA.2005.858015","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the measurement of the instantaneous frequency and amplitude of partials in vocal vibrato","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","displayDocTitle":"On the measurement of the instantaneous frequency and amplitude of partials in vocal vibrato","volume":"14","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1643666/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"8953293","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1643666/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the measurement of the instantaneous frequency and amplitude of partials in vocal vibrato","sourcePdf":"01643666.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056184S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"34446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"34446","articleId":"1643666","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1643671,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Under noisy data, our approach is equivalent to estimating the local map of a stochastic cellular automaton. Direct computations of the maximum likelihood estimates are possible for regular binary patterns. The likelihood formulation of the problem is congenial with the use of the minimum description length principle as a model selection tool.

Even though it contains error resilience features, it cannot easily cope with induced errors from computer soft faults prevalent in remote-sensing applications. Hence, new fault tolerance detection methods are developed to sense the soft errors in major parts of the system while also protecting data across the boundaries where data flow from one subsystem to the other. The design goal is to guarantee no compressed or decompressed data contain computer-induced errors without detection. Detection methods are expressed at the algorithm level so that a wide range of hardware and software implementation techniques can be covered by the fault tolerance procedures while still maintaining the JPEG output format. The major subsystems to be addressed are the discrete cosine transform, quantizer, entropy coding, and packet assembly. Each error detection method is determined by the data representations within the subsystem or across the boundaries. They vary from real number parities in the DCT to bit-level residue codes in the quantizer, cyclic redundancy check parities for entropy coding, and packet assembly. The simulation results verify detection performances even across boundaries while also examining roundoff noise effects in detecting computer-induced errors in processing steps.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1643684/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1643684/","accessionNumber":"8975772","pubMedId":"16830897","displayDocTitle":"Detecting computer-induced errors in remote-sensing JPEG compression algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting computer-induced errors in remote-sensing JPEG compression algorithms","sourcePdf":"01643684.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097541S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"34447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"34447","articleId":"1643684","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1643687,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Liu","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/34447/1643687/1643687-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhen Liu received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in telecommunications from the Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunication, China, in 1995 and 1998, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Arizona State University (ASU), Tempe, in 2003.","He is currently a Senior Engineer with the Digital Signal Processing Department, Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA.

Indeed, in order to achieve an efficient joint separation and denoising procedures in the case of high noise level in the data, a slight modification of the exposed models is presented: the Bernoulli-Gaussian mixture model, which is equivalent to a hard thresholding rule in denoising problems. A number of simulations are presented in order to highlight the performances of the aforementioned approach: 1) in both high and low signal-to-noise ratios and 2) comparing the results with respect to the choice of the wavelet basis decomposition.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2006.877068","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/34447/01643697.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2006.877068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34447","startPage":"1887","endPage":"1899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hidden Markov models for wavelet-based blind source separation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1643697","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hidden Markov models for wavelet-based blind source separation","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1643697/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"8975785","pubMedId":"16830910","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1643697/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hidden Markov models for wavelet-based blind source separation","sourcePdf":"01643697.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088588S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"34447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"34447","articleId":"1643697","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1643699,"authors":[{"name":"V.

One-dimensional (1-D) discontinuities in images (edges and contours) that are very important elements in visual perception, intersect too many wavelet basis functions and lead to a nonsparse representation. To efficiently capture these anisotropic geometrical structures characterized by many more than the horizontal and vertical directions, a more complex multidirectional (M-DIR) and anisotropic transform is required. We present a new lattice-based perfect reconstruction and critically sampled anisotropic M-DIR WT. The transform retains the separable filtering and subsampling and the simplicity of computations and filter design from the standard two-dimensional WT, unlike in the case of some other directional transform constructions (e.g., curvelets, contourlets, or edgelets). The corresponding anisotropic basis functions (directionlets) have directional vanishing moments along any two directions with rational slopes. Furthermore, we show that this novel transform provides an efficient tool for nonlinear approximation of images, achieving the approximation power O(N/sup -1.55/), which, while slower than the optimal rate O(N/sup -2/), is much better than O(N/sup -1/) achieved with wavelets, but at similar complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Directionlets: anisotropic multidirectional representation with separable filtering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2006.877076","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/34447/01643699.pdf","startPage":"1916","endPage":"1933","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2006.877076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34447","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1643699","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1643699/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","displayDocTitle":"Directionlets: anisotropic multidirectional representation with separable filtering","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/1643699/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"8985197","pubMedId":"16830912","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Directionlets: anisotropic multidirectional representation with separable filtering","sourcePdf":"01643699.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147195S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"34447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"195","xplore-issue":"34447","articleId":"1643699","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":1643708,"authors":[{"name":"Zehang Sun","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno, NV, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/34447/1643708/1643708-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zehang Sun received the B.Eng. degree in telecommunications and the M.Eng. degree in digital signal processing from Northern Jiaotong University, China, in 1994 and 1997, respectively, the M.Eng. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 1999, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science and engineering from the University of Nevada, Reno, in 2003.","He joined eTreppid Technologies, LLC, Reno, immediately upon his graduation.

The focus of this work is on the issues of feature extraction and classification for rear-view vehicle detection. Specifically, by treating the problem of vehicle detection as a two-class classification problem, we have investigated several different feature extraction methods such as principal component analysis, wavelets, and Gabor filters. To evaluate the extracted features, we have experimented with two popular classifiers, neural networks and support vector machines (SVMs). Based on our evaluation results, we have developed an on-board real-time monocular vehicle detection system that is capable of acquiring grey-scale images, using Ford's proprietary low-light camera, achieving an average detection rate of 10 Hz. Our vehicle detection algorithm consists of two main steps: a multiscale driven hypothesis generation step and an appearance-based hypothesis verification step. During the hypothesis generation step, image locations where vehicles might be present are extracted. This step uses multiscale techniques not only to speed up detection, but also to improve system robustness. The appearance-based hypothesis verification step verifies the hypotheses using Gabor features and SVMs. The system has been tested in Ford's concept vehicle under different traffic conditions (e.g., structured highway, complex urban streets, and varying weather conditions), illustrating good performance.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2006.877062","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/34447/01643708.pdf","startPage":"2019","endPage":"2034","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2006.877062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monocular precrash vehicle detection: features and classifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1643708/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","displayDocTitle":"Monocular precrash vehicle detection: features and classifiers","volume":"15","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"8985206","pubMedId":"16830921","htmlLink":"/document/1643708/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monocular precrash vehicle detection: features and classifiers","sourcePdf":"01643708.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080439S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"34447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"167","xplore-issue":"34447","articleId":"1643708","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1643758,"authors":[{"name":"B.

It is shown that a 30-Gb/s transmission over a 40-km SMF with a loss margin of greater than 4.5 dB is feasible in the aforementioned simple configuration using intensity modulation and direct detection (IMDD). In addition, the DFB-laser frequency chirp and the transmission-link loss are identified to be the key factors limiting the maximum achievable transmission performance of the technique.

For the implicit methods, the alternating-direction implicit (ADI) FDTD and the envelope ADI-FDTD are investigated. In addition, the locally one-dimensional (LOD) scheme is newly introduced into implicit FDTDs, i.e., LOD- and envelope LOD-FDTDs are developed for simple implementation of the algorithm and reduced CPU time. Numerical dispersion analysis is performed, demonstrating the improved dispersion properties of the envelope FDTD. Numerical results of a waveguide grating reveal that the wavelength responses obtained from the ADI/LOD-FDTD gradually shift toward a longer wavelength as the time step (/spl Delta/t) is increased. For the envelope ADI/LOD-FDTD with /spl Delta/t=8/spl Delta/t/sub CFL/, in which /spl Delta/t/sub CFL/ is determined by the stability criterion, the responses are in good agreement with the response of the explicit FDTD, showing the comparable CPU time to that of the explicit FDTD. Further calculations of a waveguide with high-reflection coatings reveal that the CPU time of the envelope LOD-FDTD with /spl Delta/t=32/spl Delta/t/sub CFL/ is reduced to 25% of that of the explicit FDTD.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/34448/01643807.pdf","startPage":"2465","endPage":"2472","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2006.874570","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2006.874570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34448","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1643807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of several implicit FDTD methods for optical waveguide analyses","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical waveguides","Finite difference methods","Performance analysis","Time domain analysis","Gratings","Optical modulation","Optical devices","Frequency","Educational institutions","Stability criteria"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical waveguide theory","finite difference time-domain analysis","optical dispersion","stability criteria"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["implicit FDTD method","optical waveguide","finite-difference time-domain method","alternating-direction implicit FDTD","envelope ADI-FDTD","locally one-dimensional scheme","numerical dispersion analysis","stability criterion","high-reflection coatings"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alternating-direction-implicit (ADI) scheme","beam-propagation method (BPM)","finite-difference time-domain method (FDTD)","locally one-dimensional (LOD) scheme","numerical dispersion","optical waveguide","waveguide grating"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1643807/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of several implicit FDTD methods for optical waveguide analyses","volume":"24","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1643807/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"8980490","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of several implicit FDTD methods for optical waveguide analyses","sourcePdf":"01643807.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102522S","chronDate":"June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"34448","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"34448","articleId":"1643807","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1643817,"authors":[{"name":"H.M.

The adaptive GA method suggested here addresses the problem of determining the proper Volterra candidates, which leads to the smallest error between the identified nonlinear system and the Volterra model. This is achieved by using variable-length GA chromosomes, which encode the coefficients of the selected candidates. The algorithm relies on sorting all candidates according to their correlation with the output. A certain number of candidates with the highest correlation with the output are selected to undergo the first evolution \"era\". During the process of evolution the candidates with the least significant contribution in the error-reduction process is removed. Then, the next set of candidates are applied into the next era. The process continues until a solution is found. The proposed GA method handles the issues of detecting the proper Volterra candidates and calculating the associated coefficients as a nonseparable process. The fitness function employed by the algorithm prevents irrelevant candidates from taking part in the final solution. Genetic operators are chosen to suit the floating-point representation of the genetic data. As the evolution process improves and the method reaches a near-global solution, a local search is implicitly applied by zooming in on the search interval of each gene by adaptively changing the boundaries of those intervals. The proposed algorithms have produced excellent results in modeling different nonlinear systems with white and colored Gaussian inputs with/without white Gaussian measurement noise","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1643817/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9057111","volume":"36","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1643817/","publicationDate":"July 2006","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Volterra-system identification using adaptive real-coded genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Volterra-system identification using adaptive real-coded genetic algorithm","sourcePdf":"01643817.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100354S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"34449","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"34449","articleId":"1643817","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":1643822,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The paradigm of linguistic modeling is concerned with constructing models that: 1) are user centric and 2) inherently dwell upon collections of highly interpretable and user-oriented entities such as information granules. The objective of this paper is to investigate and compare alternative design options, present an organization of the overall optimization process, and come up with a specification of several evaluation mechanisms of the performance of the models. The underlying design tool guiding the development of linguistic models revolves around the augmented version of fuzzy clustering known as a context-based or conditional fuzzy C-means (C-FCM). The design process comprises several main phases such as: 1) defining and further refining context fuzzy sets; 2) completing conditional fuzzy clustering; and 3) optimizing parameters (connections) linking information granules in the input and output spaces. An iterative process of forming information granules in the input and output spaces is discussed. Their membership functions are adjusted by the gradient-based learning guided by the minimization of some performance index. The paper comes with a comprehensive suite of experiments that lead to some design guidelines of the models. Furthermore, the performance of linguistic models is contrasted with that of other fuzzy models, especially radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) and related constructs that are based on concepts of fuzzy clustering.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2005.855755","startPage":"727","endPage":"745","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/34449/01643822.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2005.855755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34449","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linguistic models as a framework of user-centric system modeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy sets","Context modeling","Geometry","Design optimization","Performance analysis","Fuzzy neural networks","Solid modeling","Process design","Joining processes","Guidelines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","optimisation","radial basis function networks","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linguistic models","user-centric system modeling","optimization process","fuzzy clustering","conditional fuzzy C-means","gradient-based learning","performance index","radial basis function neural networks","information granules"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Context-based fuzzy clustering","fuzzy contexts","information granules","linguistic models","performance indexes","user-centric modeling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1643822/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","displayDocTitle":"Linguistic models as a framework of user-centric system modeling","volume":"36","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1643822/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","accessionNumber":"9057116","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linguistic models as a framework of user-centric system modeling","sourcePdf":"01643822.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104217S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"34449","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"34449","articleId":"1643822","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1643842,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Manufacturing scheduling is the process of selecting a process plan and assigning manufacturing resources for specific time periods to the set of manufacturing processes in the plan. It is, in fact, an optimization process by which limited manufacturing resources are allocated over time among parallel and sequential activities. Manufacturing process planning and scheduling are usually considered to be two separate and distinct phases. Traditional optimization approaches to these problems do not consider the constraints of both domains simultaneously and result in suboptimal solutions. Without considering real-time machine workloads and shop floor dynamics, process plans may become suboptimal or even invalid at the time of execution. Therefore, there is a need for the integration of manufacturing process-planning and scheduling systems for generating more realistic and effective plans.

However, its computational complexity is usually very high, especially in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. This paper presents a new low-complexity SMC (LC-SMC) algorithm for blind detection in MIMO systems, the main idea of which is to shrink the sampling space via channel estimation which is initialized using the first differentially modulated symbol and then updated using the Monte Carlo samples. Since the a posteriori probability of the transmitted symbols can be calculated separately by each transmit antenna, the proposed LC-SMC algorithm is not only computationally efficient, as compared to the original SMC whose complexity grows exponentially with the number of transmit antennas, but also makes blind turbo receiver more feasible for multilevel/phase modulations. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the LC-SMC algorithm","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-complexity sequential Monte Carlo algorithm for blind detection in MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2006.874790","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/34451/01643890.pdf","startPage":"2485","endPage":"2496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2006.874790","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34451","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1643890","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1643890/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","displayDocTitle":"A low-complexity sequential Monte Carlo algorithm for blind detection in MIMO systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/1643890/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"8954810","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-complexity sequential Monte Carlo algorithm for blind detection in MIMO systems","sourcePdf":"01643890.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094946S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"34451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"34451","articleId":"1643890","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1643894,"authors":[{"name":"C.R.

The receiver employs a flexible chip-level iterative multiuser detection scheme where the variable spreading gain affects only the despreading parameters. Optimization across the physical and network layers in the uplink of such a system is treated. It is assumed that each user employs an low-density parity-check (LDPC) code to protect its data. At the physical layer, the quality of service (QoS) requirement is specified in terms of the target bit error rate (BER) of each user. Optimal user transmit powers are dynamically adjusted according to the current system load and the corresponding rate requirements. At the network layer, the QoS requirements include the call blocking probabilities, call connection delays, packet congestion probabilities and packet loss rates. To maximize the average revenue of the network subject to both call-level and packet-level QoS constraints, a multicriterion reinforcement learning (MCRL)-based adaptive call admission control (CAC) method is proposed that can easily handle multiple average QoS requirements. Unlike existing model-based approaches, the MCRL-based technique does not require the explicit knowledge of the state transition probabilities to derive the optimal policy. This feature is important when the number of states is so large that model-based optimization algorithms become infeasible, which is typically the case for a large integrated service network supporting a number of different service types","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2006.874371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2006.874371","startPage":"2567","endPage":"2578","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/34451/01643896.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer optimization for LDPC-coded multirate multiuser systems with QoS constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer optimization for LDPC-coded multirate multiuser systems with QoS constraints","publicationDate":"July 2006","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","volume":"54","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8954816","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1643896/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer optimization for LDPC-coded multirate multiuser systems with QoS constraints","sourcePdf":"01643896.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035628S","chronDate":"July  2006","isNumber":"34451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"4","articleId":"1643896","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1643897,"authors":[{"name":"Zidong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems and Computing, Brunei University, Uxbridge, Middlesex, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/34451/1643897/1643897-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zidong Wang (SM'02) was born in Jiangsu, China, in 1966.

Several alternative approaches to designing the correction filter are suggested, which differ in their assumptions on the signal and noise. The classical deconvolution solutions (least-squares, Tikhonov, and Wiener) are adapted to our particular situation, and new methods that are optimal in a minimax sense are also proposed.

It has been shown that the PHD is the best-fit approximation of the multitarget posterior in an information-theoretic sense. The method avoids the need for explicit data association, as the target states are viewed as a single global target state, and the identities of the targets are not part of the tracking framework.

Recently, a new method of detecting narrowband signals which uses a close approximation to the matched filter is proposed by Raja Kumar. The impulse response of this filter turns out to be longer than that of the matched filter. In order to support this extra length of filter response, it is proposed that the signal be extrapolated by prediction before the filtering operation. In this paper, the characteristics of this detector are mathematically analyzed and the performance of the detector in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is studied. The detection method uses predicted signals that are obtained typically from short time data. Hence, in this paper, a method of analyzing the statistics of predicted signals from short time data is presented, and it is applied for the performance analysis of the present detector. The accuracy of the present detection analysis is demonstrated through theoretical and simulation studies.

In these algorithms, due to particular structure of the precoders, the blind identification problem for a MIMO channel is decomposed into several independent single-input multiple-output (SIMO) channel identification problems.

This technique is suitable for several existing hybrid STBC schemes, such as STBC/orthogonal-frequency-division multiplexing (STBC-OFDM) and STBC/code-division multiple access (STBC-CDMA). We show that by exploiting the redundancy in the structure of STBC, a zero-forcing equalizer can be constructed without channel estimation. The conditions for the identifiability of the zero-forcing equalizer are also derived to ensure correct equalization. To further improve the performance of the proposed method, a new iterative algorithm is developed by incorporating the finite alphabet property of information symbols.

As current receivers use powerful error-correcting codes and operate at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), these problems have become increasingly challenging: one is forced either to waste a part of the bandwidth on training symbols or to consider novel hypothesis testing techniques. We will consider five algorithms for hypothesis testing that exploit properties of the underlying channel code: a re-encoding (REEN) technique, an algorithm we previously derived from the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, two recently proposed algorithms known as mode separation (MS) and pseudo-ML (PML), and a technique where all hypotheses are tested simultaneously by applying the sum-product algorithm (SPA) to the overall factor graph of the system. These techniques will be compared in terms of their computational complexity, the class of problems to which they can be applied and their error rate performance. Through computer simulations we show that the EM-based and the PML algorithms have excellent performance. The MS, PML, REEN, and EM-based algorithms all have similar complexity, but the latter algorithm is suitable for a much wider range of applications. The SPA has the lowest computational complexity, but might yield poor performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1643913/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","publicationDate":"July 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1643913/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2006","accessionNumber":"8954833","volume":"54","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Code-aided frame synchronization and phase ambiguity resolution","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code-aided frame synchronization and phase ambiguity resolution","sourcePdf":"01643913.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102581S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"34451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"34451","articleId":"1643913","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1643914,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Our approach is based on minimizing the difference between the performance of the MIMO-CDMA system and the described upper bounds at each signature assignment step. We next note that the transmit beamformers can be shaped depending on the channel state information (CSI) available at the transmitter. We investigate the cases of various levels of available feedback resulting in different beamformer structures and present a joint orthogonal temporal signature assignment and beamforming algorithm.

Assuming that each transmitter is equipped with t antennas and each receiver with r antennas and each receiver implements single-user detection, we show that in the absence of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitters, the asymptotic network spectral efficiency is limited by r nats/s/Hz as Krarrinfin and is independent of t and the transmit power. With CSI corresponding to the intended receiver available at the transmitter, we demonstrate that the asymptotic spectral efficiency is at least t+r+2radictr nats/s/Hz. Asymptotically optimum signaling is also derived under the same CSI assumption, i.e., each transmitter knows the channel corresponding to its desired receiver only. Further capacity improvement is possible with stronger CSI assumption; we demonstrate this using a heuristic interference suppression transmit beamforming approach. The conventional orthogonal transmission approach is also analyzed. In particular, we show that with idealized medium access control, the channelized transmission has unbounded asymptotic spectral efficiency under the constant per-user power constraint. The impact of different power constraints on the asymptotic spectral efficiency is also carefully examined.

The critical areas in the 3D chip stacked package are defined with finite element modeling (FEM) based simulations to correlate the thermal cycling experiments. The 3D chip stacked package consists of two 300mum thick Si chips vertically connected with Sn-Ag-Cu solder bump joints and then assembled on a conventional FR-4 printed circuit aboard (PCB). Two thermal cycle conditions are studied, namely: -40 to 125degC and 0 to 100degC. FEM simulations indicate that in both conditions, the critical failure location is expected to be in the chip side region of the corner solder bump of the lower chip connecting the package to the PCB.

Furthermore, we have investigated the possible approaches to improve the thermo-mechanical reliability for this package. The results indicate that adding an underfill or thinning Si chips will achieve lower creep strain in solder bumps. Furthermore, the stress levels in Si and Cu via in the Si chip are low.

It is necessary to understand the mechanical properties of epoxy materials at a fundamental level as a guide in the experimental design of epoxy resin for high reliability. Molecular modeling is widespread in its usage and has been used to investigate the mechanical properties of polymer at the molecular level, including the investigation of the Tg. The present study is focused on the material properties of the cured epoxy resin. MD model of the epoxy was built using the amorphous module. MD simulations were carried out starting at 225degC under a pressure of 0.1Mpa using the ensembles of the constant number of particles, constant-pressure and constant temperature (NPT). Temperature was lowered to room temperature at a rate of 10 degC/200ps. Each subsequent simulation was started from the final configuration obtained at the preceding temperature. Non-bond interactions cut-off distance of 1.5 nm with a smooth switching function was used in all simulations. The simulation in each case study was performed with an interval of 1 femto second (fs) in each MD simulation step. Density of the epoxy at each temperature was calculated from the average specific volume. Tg was estimated based on the discontinuity in the slope of the density-temperature plot. The volumetric thermal expansion coefficient was obtained from the relation of the variation of the volume and temperature. The corresponding linear thermal expansion coefficient of the epoxy can be calculated. Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the epoxy can also be obtained from MD simulations. The predicted values of these mechanical properties are close to the experimental values","displayPublicationTitle":"EuroSime 2006 - 7th International Conference on Thermal, Mechanical and Multiphysics Simulation and Experiments in Micro-Electronics and Micro-Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10938/34453/01644033.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"EuroSime 2006 - 7th International Conference on Thermal, Mechanical and Multiphysics Simulation and Experiments in Micro-Electronics and Micro-Systems","doi":"10.1109/ESIME.2006.1644033","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESIME.2006.1644033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34453","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1644033","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of Material Properties of Epoxy Materials using Molecular Dynamic Simulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Material properties","Predictive models","Temperature","Mechanical factors","Electronics packaging","Epoxy resins","Thermal expansion","Design for experiments","Materials reliability","Polymers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["molecular dynamics method","Poisson ratio","polymers","thermal expansion","Young's modulus"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["material properties","epoxy materials","molecular dynamic simulation","molecular modeling","mechanical properties","epoxy resin","MD model","amorphous module","MD simulations","constant pressure","constant temperature","nonbond interactions","smooth switching function","density-temperature plot","linear thermal expansion coefficient","Young modulus","Poisson ratio","0.1 MPa","225 C"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1644033/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 April 2006","displayDocTitle":"Prediction of Material Properties of Epoxy Materials using Molecular Dynamic Simulation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1644033/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9120131","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","conferenceDate":"24-26 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of Material Properties of Epoxy Materials using Molecular Dynamic Simulation","confLoc":"Como, Italy","sourcePdf":"01644033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077058S","chronDate":"24-26 April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10938","isNumber":"34453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10938","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"34453","articleId":"1644033","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1644134,"authors":[{"name":"M.

However, embedded systems being naturally heterogeneous, they require the coexistence of several models of computation. In software engineering, the great challenge is how to specify heterogeneous interfaces for ensuring well defined communications because various semantic properties are mixed. Therefore, some existing approaches use only a set of few models of computation to reduce this complexity. Some others can use an open set of models of computation but reduce the complexity by forbidding to use different models of computation in the same hierarchical level. This paper proposes a modeling approach based on the meta-modeling of models of computation. It allows to mix different models of computation by using a meta-model of computation which provides a common semantic description at a higher abstraction level. This makes easier to specify the interactions between models of computation.","doi":"10.1109/CTS.2006.15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CTS.2006.15","startPage":"194","endPage":"199","displayPublicationTitle":"International Symposium on Collaborative Technologies and Systems (CTS'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10940/34455/01644134.pdf","publicationTitle":"International Symposium on Collaborative Technologies and Systems (CTS'06)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Overall Specification of a Meta-Model of Computation For Model-Driven Embedded System Modeling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"An Overall Specification of a Meta-Model of Computation For Model-Driven Embedded System Modeling","conferenceDate":"14-17 May 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1644134/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1644134/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Overall Specification of a Meta-Model of Computation For Model-Driven Embedded System Modeling","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"01644134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.166869S","chronDate":"14-17 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10940","isNumber":"34455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10940","xplore-issue":"34455","articleId":"1644134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1644160,"authors":[{"name":"K.H.

In this paper, we turn our attention onto a historical perspective of movement and examine trajectories generated by streaming positional updates. The key challenge is how to maintain a concise, yet quite reliable summary of each object's movement, avoiding any superfluous details and saving in processing complexity and communication cost. We propose two single-pass approximation techniques based on sampling that take advantage of the spatial locality and temporal timeliness inherent in trajectory streams. As a means of reducing substantially the scale of the datasets, we utilize heuristic prediction to distinguish which locations to preserve in the compressed trajectories. A comprehensive experimental study verifies the stability and robustness of the proposed techniques and demonstrates that intelligent compression schemes are able to act as effective load shedding operators achieving remarkable results","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling Trajectory Streams with Spatiotemporal Criteria","publicationTitle":"18th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management (SSDBM'06)","doi":"10.1109/SSDBM.2006.45","displayPublicationTitle":"18th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management (SSDBM'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10944/34459/01644324.pdf","startPage":"275","endPage":"284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSDBM.2006.45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34459","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1644324","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1644324/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Sampling Trajectory Streams with Spatiotemporal Criteria","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1644324/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9190129","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling Trajectory Streams with Spatiotemporal Criteria","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"01644324.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050398S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"10944","isNumber":"34459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10944","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"34459","articleId":"1644324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1644463,"authors":[{"name":"G.F.

Nevertheless, the conventional microscope analysis does not provide enough sensitivity, and the manual microscope scoring of micronuclei is a tedious and time-consuming procedure. A new flow-cytometry measurement device with specific hardware and software innovations helps in solving such problem. The paper describes the results of a research project aimed to produce a tomography system able to acquire 3D images of cells in laminar flow. This research was supported by the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR) under the project FIRB 2001 RBAUOIZMZ5. On the basis of this research an innovative image flow cytometer has been designed and prototyped. The innovations concern with both the hardware and the software architecture.

This paper presents an extension to the single-keyhole channel model, termed a \"multi-keyhole channel\", which includes a number of statistically independent keyholes. Correlated full-rank and rank-deficient multi-keyhole channels are considered in detail. Under some general conditions the full-rank multi-keyhole channel is asymptotically Rayleigh fading if the number of keyholes is large. When the number of both Tx and Rx antennas is large, the capacity of a rank-deficient multi-keyhole channel is a sum of the capacities of the equivalent single-keyhole channels. The outage capacity distribution of both full-rank and rank-deficient multi-keyhole channels is asymptotically Gaussian.

In each user selection algorithm, M beamforming directions are selected, where M indicates the number of transmit antennas. Each active beamforming direction utilizes fixed-rate block coded modulation (BCM) scheme. It is assumed that the perfect CSI is known at the beginning of each block, while the channel varies over time. The effect of channel aging is modeled as an additive noise with time-varying power.

We consider the transmission of continuous- or discrete-time Gaussian sources and assume that the processing on the signals are within the family of linear operations. For stationary signals, a constraint on the power at the output of the transmission filter results in bandpass transmit and receive filters whose bandpass region include the frequencies at which the source spectra is above some threshold. This result shows similarities between the rate distortion arguments and the minimum mean square error (MSE) attainable by the optimum linear systems. Examples for frequently encountered source statistics are also studied and it is shown that linear processing both at the transmitter and at the receiver reduces the estimation errors significantly compared to the standard Wiener filtering approach. It is shown that for communication of a bandlimited source with arbitrary spectrum over a bandlimited channel with the same bandwidth as the source, using proposed linear processing approach attains the same distortion exponent as the theoretically optimum system does","doi":"10.1109/BSC.2006.1644582","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BSC.2006.1644582","startPage":"108","endPage":"111","displayPublicationTitle":"23rd Biennial Symposium on Communications, 2006","pdfPath":"/iel5/10949/34465/01644582.pdf","publicationTitle":"23rd Biennial Symposium on Communications, 2006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Linear Systems for Power Constrained Transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Linear Systems for Power Constrained Transmission","conferenceDate":"30 May-1 June 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1644582/","accessionNumber":"9061267","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1644582/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Linear Systems for Power Constrained Transmission","confLoc":"Kingston, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"01644582.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036507S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"10949","isNumber":"34465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10949","xplore-issue":"34465","articleId":"1644582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1644583,"authors":[{"name":"Yugang Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen''s University Belfast, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Yugang Zhou","id":"37417493300"},{"name":"Wai-Yip Chan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen''s University Belfast, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Wai-Yip Chan","id":"37272831400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9528-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1644583","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Source coding","MIMO","Space time codes","Diversity methods","Decoding","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Diversity reception","Error probability","Binary phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel coding","MIMO systems","source coding","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple description coding","space-time coding","multiple input multiple output channel","MIMO","channel code","antenna array"]}],"abstract":"We examine the performance of combining single or multiple description coding with space-time coding over multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channels.

One of the blind synchronization methods is the cyclic prefix (CP) based maximum likelihood (ML) symbol timing and carrier frequency synchronization which correlates the cyclic prefix and the last part of the OFDM symbol. However, the performance of this method is seriously reduced in the time-variant multipath channel. In this paper, we propose a new CP which has two parts. One part is a copy of the head of the last symbol and the other part is a copy of the tail of that symbol. Both parts have the length of half of the CP. As a result of this new CP, the starting time of one OFDM symbol is allowed to fall into its effective period (the absolute value of the symbol timing error should be smaller than CP/2).

The proposals use designs of M-band synthesis and analysis filter bank pairs for OFDM-like multiuser communications systems to improve on the properties of OFDM systems by using the naturally superior characteristics of filtering of filter banks. A number of papers are also discussed on designs of M-band filter banks aimed at improving the filtering properties of OFDM communication systems. Synchronization for these M-band filter banks has not been discussed in the literature so far, and is likely to raise problems not foreseen for such filter banks if the designs do not use linear-phase filters. Reasons are discussed for the choice of linear-phase filters in filter bank tree designs. In particular the high sensitivities in the design of a synchronization scheme make non-linear phase filters an undesirable design choice. It is proposed that filter bank tree designs using linear phase filters be studied as an alternative to the filtering used in OFDM systems, and to provide a potentially superior design choice to the M-band designs","doi":"10.1109/BSC.2006.1644606","publicationTitle":"23rd Biennial Symposium on Communications, 2006","displayPublicationTitle":"23rd Biennial Symposium on Communications, 2006","pdfPath":"/iel5/10949/34465/01644606.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BSC.2006.1644606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization for Multi-User Communications Waveforms Generated Using Filter Bank Trees: A Promising Alternative to OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1644606","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1644606/","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization for Multi-User Communications Waveforms Generated Using Filter Bank Trees: A Promising Alternative to OFDM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9061289","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1644606/","conferenceDate":"30 May-1 June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization for Multi-User Communications Waveforms Generated Using Filter Bank Trees: A Promising Alternative to OFDM","confLoc":"Kingston, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"01644606.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045729S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"10949","isNumber":"34465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10949","xplore-issue":"34465","articleId":"1644606","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1644615,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The channel estimation and beam selection use special OFDM pilot symbols which consist in beam-specific pilot samples frequency multiplexed on the available downlink subcarriers. At the reception, beam channels seen on each subcarrier are estimated, then the best serving beam is selected. For equalization purposes, an interpolation is used between channel estimates for the selected beam, to obtain the missing beam channel estimates on the subcarriers that were allocated to other beams on the pilot symbol. In contrast to previous works, which assumed an uplink/downlink channel symmetry to select the serving beam from uplink measurements, our proposition considers the use of the MISO downlink channel measurements obtained at the mobile.

The resulting method is validated for one-dimensional and multidimensional data. For the one-dimensional data, the experiments concern artificial and real SAP image histograms.

Existing methods for computing sentence similarity have been adopted from approaches used for long text documents. These methods process sentences in a very high-dimensional space and are consequently inefficient, require human input, and are not adaptable to some application domains. This paper focuses directly on computing the similarity between very short texts of sentence length. It presents an algorithm that takes account of semantic information and word order information implied in the sentences. The semantic similarity of two sentences is calculated using information from a structured lexical database and from corpus statistics. The use of a lexical database enables our method to model human common sense knowledge and the incorporation of corpus statistics allows our method to be adaptable to different domains. The proposed method can be used in a variety of applications that involve text knowledge representation and discovery. Experiments on two sets of selected sentence pairs demonstrate that the proposed method provides a similarity measure that shows a significant correlation to human intuition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1644735/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9042540","htmlLink":"/document/1644735/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"8","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Sentence similarity based on semantic nets and corpus statistics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sentence similarity based on semantic nets and corpus statistics","sourcePdf":"01644735.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110691S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"34468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"410","xplore-issue":"34468","articleId":"1644735","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1644743,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

A major performance bottleneck in sensor networks is energy since it is impractical to replace the batteries in embedded sensor nodes post-deployment. A significant portion of the energy expenditure is attributed to communications and, in particular, the nodes close to the sensor network gateways used for data collection typically suffer a large overhead as these nodes must relay data from the remaining network. Even with compression and in-network processing to reduce the amount of communicated data, all the processed data must still traverse these nodes to reach the gateway. We discuss a network infrastructure based on the use of controllably mobile elements to reduce the communication energy consumption at the energy constrained nodes and, thus, increase useful network lifetime. In addition, our approach yields advantages in delay-tolerant networks and sparsely deployed networks. We first show how our approach helps reduce energy consumption at battery constrained nodes. Second, we describe our system prototype, which utilizes our proposed approach to improve the energy performance. As part of the prototyping effort, we experienced several interesting design choices and trade-offs that affect system capabilities and performance. We describe many of these design challenges and discuss the algorithms developed for addressing these. In particular, we focus on network protocols and motion control strategies.

The conventional adaptive frequency hopping (AFH) strategies avoid frequency-static interference by reducing the hopset, but this deteriorates the performance if there is also self-interference. In this paper, we propose dynamic AFH (DAFH) mechanisms that are concurrently employed by collocated WPANs in order to avoid the self-interference. With DAFH, WPAN adaptively self-allocates a subset of frequency channels to be hopped, such as to minimize the experienced interference. The packet error rate is the only input to the proposed mechanisms, which enables DAFH to also avoid interference from frequency-static interferer. The optimization of the throughput should not be the sole target of the DAFH because WPAN operates in unlicensed spectrum and arbitrary adaptation of the FH pattern may be harmful to proximate non-WPAN devices. Therefore, we define and adopt an etiquette rule to characterize the behavior of the collocated WPANs with DAFH as a single collective entity that produces interference. The operation of DAFH is robust and adaptive to the dynamic changes in the environment and to the noise errors in the channel. Simulation results show that DAFH significantly increases the throughput of the WPANs in presence of both self-interference and frequency-static interference, while the WPANs employ best effort to minimize changes in the overall interference pattern","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1644745/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"5","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1644745/","accessionNumber":"9015771","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic adaptive frequency hopping for mutually interfering wireless personal area networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic adaptive frequency hopping for mutually interfering wireless personal area networks","sourcePdf":"01644745.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117385S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"34469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"34469","articleId":"1644745","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1644747,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/34469/1644747/1644747-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yong Sun received the BS and MS degrees from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1998 and 2001, respectively.

The BER performance of the space-time coded OFDM-based MIMO system based on a newly built broadband MIMO fading model is first evaluated by assuming perfect channel state information at the receiver for coherent detection. Then, for a given average SNR (hence, BER), a fast local search algorithm is applied to optimize the unequal error protection design in JSCC, subjected to fixed total transmitted energy for various constellation sizes. This design allows the measurement of the expected reconstructed image quality.

This paper explores the detector blurring component of the system model for a whole body positron emission tomography (PET) system and extends this factor into a more general system response function to account for other system effects including the influence of Fourier rebinning (FORE). We model the system response function as a three-dimensional (3-D) function that blurs in the radial and axial dimension and is spatially variant in radial location. This function is derived from Monte Carlo simulations and incorporates inter-crystal scatter, crystal penetration, and the blurring due to the FORE algorithm. The improved system model is applied in a modified ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm to reconstruct images from rebinned, fully 3-D PET data. The proposed method effectively removes the spatial variance in the resolution response, as shown in simulations of point sources. Furthermore, simulation and measured studies show the proposed method improves quantitative accuracy with a reduction in tumor bias compared to conventional OSEM on the order of 10%-30% depending on tumor size and smoothing parameter.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Whole-body PET","Spatial resolution","Positron emission tomography","Neoplasms","Degradation","Error correction","Detectors","Scattering","Image reconstruction","Size measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tumours","positron emission tomography","medical image processing","image reconstruction","image resolution","Monte Carlo methods","expectation-maximisation algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system response functions","3-D whole body PET","positron emission tomography","spatially variant system models","detector blurring component","Fourier rebinning","Monte Carlo simulations","intercrystal scatter","crystal penetration","ordered subsets expectation maximization","image reconstruction","image resolution","tumor bias","smoothing parameter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Detector response","Fourier rebinning (FORE)","fully three-dimensional (3-D) positron emission tomography (PET)","system model","system response"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artifacts","Computer Simulation","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Information Storage and Retrieval","Models, Biological","Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted","Phantoms, Imaging","Positron-Emission Tomography","Positron-Emission Tomography","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Whole Body Imaging"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2006.873222","startPage":"828","endPage":"837","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/34472/01644799.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2006.873222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and incorporation of system response functions in 3-D whole body PET","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modeling and incorporation of system response functions in 3-D whole body PET","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8959432","pubMedId":"16827484","publicationDate":"July 2006","volume":"25","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1644799/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1644799/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and incorporation of system response functions in 3-D whole body PET","sourcePdf":"01644799.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059075S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"34472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"134","xplore-issue":"34472","articleId":"1644799","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1644806,"authors":[{"name":"V.Y.

The elements of the system matrix for the clinical Hi-Rez scanner were derived by processing the data measured for a point source at different positions in a portion of the field of view. These measured data included axial compression and azimuthal interleaving of adjacent projections. Measured data were corrected for crystal and geometrical efficiency. Then, a whole system matrix was derived by processing the responses in projection space. Such responses included both geometrical and detection physics components of the system matrix. The response was parameterized to correct for point source location and to smooth for projection noise. The model also accounts for axial compression (span) used on the scanner. The forward projector for iterative reconstruction was constructed using the estimated response parameters. This paper extends our previous work to fully three-dimensional. Experimental data were used to compare images reconstructed by the standard iterative reconstruction software and the one modeling the response function. The results showed that the modeling of the response function improves both spatial resolution and noise properties","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Positron emission tomography","Image reconstruction","Position measurement","Image coding","Iterative methods","Interleaved codes","Physics","Parameter estimation","Software standards","Spatial resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","iterative methods","medical image processing","positron emission tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fully 3-D PET reconstruction","system matrix","point source measurements","statistical iterative methods","Hi-Rez scanner","axial compression","azimuthal adjacent projection interleaving","projection noise","spatial resolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Positron emission tomography (PET) iterative reconstruction","point spread function (PSF) modeling","system response"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Phantoms, Imaging","Positron-Emission Tomography","Positron-Emission Tomography","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2006.876171","startPage":"907","endPage":"921","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/34472/01644806.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2006.876171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fully 3-D PET reconstruction with system matrix derived from point source measurements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fully 3-D PET reconstruction with system matrix derived from point source measurements","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8959439","pubMedId":"16827491","publicationDate":"July 2006","volume":"25","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1644806/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1644806/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fully 3-D PET reconstruction with system matrix derived from point source measurements","sourcePdf":"01644806.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077093S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"34472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"389","xplore-issue":"34472","articleId":"1644806","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1644817,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Based on area scaling, it will be shown that a significant improvement for n- and p-FET devices is obtained when considering the area independent, uncorrelated progressive wear-out of a localized SBD spot.","doi":"10.1109/LED.2006.877710","startPage":"609","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/55/34473/01644842.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2006.877710","endPage":"611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of failure criteria on the reliability prediction of CMOS devices with ultrathin gate oxides based on voltage ramp stress","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1644842/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2006","displayDocTitle":"Impact of failure criteria on the reliability prediction of CMOS devices with ultrathin gate oxides based on voltage ramp stress","volume":"27","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/1644842/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8990882","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","publicationDate":"July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of failure criteria on the reliability prediction of CMOS devices with ultrathin gate oxides based on voltage ramp stress","sourcePdf":"01644842.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037553S","chronDate":"July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"34473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"34473","articleId":"1644842","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1644860,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The basic concept is to combine different delayed edges in order to form a very short duration \"logical\" pulse, and then filter it, so as to obtain an UWB pulse. It is possible to vary the output pulse shape, and thus the corresponding spectrum, just by acting on the delayed edge combination. Furthermore, the pulse generator supports both position modulation (2-PPM) and polarity modulation (BPSK modulation) in order to convey data through the air. Its power consumption remains less than 10 mW for a raw data rate of up to 160 Mb/s.

As an example of the effectiveness of the model, we present calculations of the back electromotive force and the cogging torque waveforms in a surface PM motor.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34475","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/34475/01644900.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2006.874594","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2006.874594","startPage":"1828","endPage":"1837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical calculation of magnetic field distribution in the slotted air gap of a surface permanent-magnet motor using complex relative air-gap permeance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1644900/","displayDocTitle":"Analytical calculation of magnetic field distribution in the slotted air gap of a surface permanent-magnet motor using complex relative air-gap permeance","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1644900/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"42","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"8973553","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","publicationDate":"July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical calculation of magnetic field distribution in the slotted air gap of a surface permanent-magnet motor using complex relative air-gap permeance","sourcePdf":"01644900.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123985S","chronDate":"July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"34475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"385","xplore-issue":"34475","articleId":"1644900","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1644902,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaohui Ren","affiliation":["Mohawk Innovative Technology, Inc., Albany, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Zhaohui Ren","id":"37555445000"},{"name":"L.S.

We solve the radial and angular components of the two-dimensional instantaneous magnetic field distribution in the low-permeability region induced from the rotor PMs and stator windings separately, using the unwrapped geometry, and then superimpose them. Instead of being incorporated into the boundary conditions, the general winding current and PM magnetization distributions are expanded into the Fourier series in the separate source layers, with respect to one motor revolution and one PM pole pair, respectively. For each source, we first solve one homogenous Laplace's equation in the planar layer without source and one nonhomogenous Laplace's equation in the planar layer with source simultaneously in Cartesian coordinates for a centered rotor and then add the rotor eccentricity. We compare the analytical solutions for the individual magnetic field distributions, as well as the total force and torque production, to those from the finite-element analysis (FEA), and find excellent agreement between the two. We characterize the open loop current and negative stiffness gains of the SBM from the linearized force-current-displacement relationship, which forms the basis for the linear system modeling and controller design, and validate our results by comparison with the FEA results.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2006.874184","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/34475/01644902.pdf","startPage":"1849","endPage":"1860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2006.874184","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1644902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Force characteristics and gain determination for a slotless self-bearing motor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1644902/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Force characteristics and gain determination for a slotless self-bearing motor","volume":"42","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"8973555","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1644902/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Force characteristics and gain determination for a slotless self-bearing motor","sourcePdf":"01644902.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084229S","chronDate":"July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"34475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"34475","articleId":"1644902","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1644910,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The modularity allows the assembly of scanners of different sizes and characteristics in order to satisfy the specific needs of the individual member institutions. The system performs depth of interaction detection by using a phoswich arrangement combining LSO and LuYAP scintillators which are coupled to Multichannel Photomultipliers (PMTs). For each PMT a free running 40 MHz ADC digitizes the signal and the complete scintillation pulse is sampled by an FPGA and sent with 20 MB/s to a PC for preprocessing. The pulse provides information about the gamma energy and the scintillator material which identifies the interaction layer. Furthermore, the exact pulse starting time is obtained from the sampled data. This is important as no hardware coincidence detection is implemented. All single events are recorded and coincidences are identified by software. The system in Ju/spl uml/lich (ClearPET Neuro) is equipped with 10240 crystals on 80 PMTs.

For this, a real time data acquisition system for a 148 channel MEG and online signal processing for artifact rejection, filtering, cross trial phase resetting analysis and three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction of the cerebral current sources was developed. The developed PCI bus hardware is based on a FPGA and DSP design, using the benefits from both architectures.

The DAE system processes data frames that come from a front-end (FE) electronics, identifies the relevant data and transfers it to a PC for image processing. The design is supported in a novel D&T methodology, in which hierarchy, modularity and parallelism are extensively exploited to improve design and testability features. Parameterization has also been used to improve design flexibility. Nominal frequency is 100 MHz. The DAE must respond to a data acquisition rate of 1 million relevant events (coincidences) per second, under a total single photon background rate in the detector of 10 MHz.

Four digitized signals from a charge division circuit, which collects currents from the 8/spl times/8 anode matrix of the photomultiplier, are used as inputs to the NN, thus reducing drastically the number of electronic channels required. We have simulated the computation of the position for 511 keV gamma photons impacting perpendicularly to the detector surface. Thus, we have performed a thorough analysis of the NN architecture and training procedures in order to achieve the best results in terms of spatial resolution and bias correction. Results obtained using GEANT4 simulation toolkit show a resolution of 1.3 mm/1.9 mm FWHM at the center/edge of the detector and less than 1 mm of systematic error in the position near the edges of the scintillator. The results confirm that NNs can partially model and correct the non-uniform detector response using only the position-weighted signals from a simple 2D DPC circuit. Linearity degradation for oblique incidence is also investigated. Finally, the NN can be implemented in hardware for parallel real time corrected Line-of-Response (LOR) estimation. Results on resources occupancy and throughput in FPGA are presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/34476/01644941.pdf","startPage":"776","endPage":"783","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2006.875438","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2006.875438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34476","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1644941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Corrected position estimation in PET detector modules with multi-anode PMTs using neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Positron emission tomography","Neural networks","Gamma ray detectors","Photomultipliers","Computational modeling","Spatial resolution","Cameras","Slabs","Coupling circuits","Anodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["positron emission tomography","nuclear electronics","gamma-ray detection","solid scintillation detectors","photomultipliers","neural nets","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["corrected position estimation","PET detector modules","neural networks","gamma ray detector modules","continuous scintillators","multianode photomultiplier tubes","LSO","digitized signals","charge division circuit","electronic channels","spatial resolution","training procedure","nonuniform detector","position weighted signals","linearity degradation","oblique incidence","parallel real time corrected line-of-response estimation","FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1644941/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Corrected position estimation in PET detector modules with multi-anode PMTs using neural networks","volume":"53","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1644941/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"8982294","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Corrected position estimation in PET detector modules with multi-anode PMTs using neural networks","sourcePdf":"01644941.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091389S","chronDate":"June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"34476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"34476","articleId":"1644941","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1644950,"authors":[{"name":"D.F.

The aim is to increase real-time data processing capabilities in experimental environments such as nuclear fusion devices (e.g., ITER). The model has these features: 1) Real-time data acquisition: the system has been provided with real-time capabilities, developing specific data acquisition kernel modules under Linux and RTAI, using COMEDI project drivers; 2) Multiprocessor PCI eXtensions for Instrumentation (PXI) Architecture: the model makes possible to add one or more processing cards (in nonsystem slots) to each standard PXI chassis. Several real-time software modules have been developed to allow the communication between the PXI controller and the processing cards. This way the system performance is not restricted to the PXI controller's own performance. This model provides scalability to the system, adding or removing processing cards; 3) Real-time acquired data distribution: with this model it is possible to define how to distribute, in real-time, the data from all acquired signals in the system among the processing cards and the PXI controller; and 4) Dynamic Data Processing: a software platform has been developed to allow users to dynamically manage their own data processing algorithms in the system. This means that users can start, stop, modify, and replace their data processing algorithms without disrupting the data acquisition process or the rest of the data processing algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/34476/01644965.pdf","startPage":"923","endPage":"926","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2006.874372","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2006.874372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34476","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1644965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PXI-based architecture for real-time data acquisition and distributed dynamic data processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data acquisition","Data processing","Real time systems","Communication system control","Fusion reactors","Kernel","Linux","Instruments","Computer architecture","Standards development"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Tokamak devices","data acquisition","peripheral interfaces","operating system kernels","Linux","nuclear engineering computing","fusion reactor instrumentation","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PXI-based architecture model","real-time data acquisition","distributed dynamic data processing","compact PCI platforms","real-time data processing","nuclear fusion device","ITER","data acquisition kernel module","Linux","RTAI","COMEDI project driver","multiprocessor PCI extension","processing cards","nonsystem slots","real-time software module","acquired data distribution","thermonuclear fusion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data acquisition","distributed data processing","real-time systems","thermonuclear fusion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1644965/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"PXI-based architecture for real-time data acquisition and distributed dynamic data processing","volume":"53","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1644965/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"8982318","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PXI-based architecture for real-time data acquisition and distributed dynamic data processing","sourcePdf":"01644965.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04893S","chronDate":"June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"34476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"34476","articleId":"1644965","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1645000,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A full size detector module suitable for a whole-body 3D PET scanner has been constructed based on the prototype designs and consists of 1620 4/spl times/4/spl times/30 mm/sup 3/ LaBr/sub 3/ crystals. We have utilized simulations to guide experimental measurements with the goal of optimizing energy and time resolution in evaluating triggering configurations and pulse shaping needed in a full system. Experimental measurements with the detector module indicate energy and time resolution consistent with our earlier prototypes when measured at low count rate. At very high count rate the energy, time and spatial resolution degrade due to pulse pileup. While it is possible to reduce pulse pileup by using smaller photomultiplier tubes (i.e., 39 mm instead of 50 mm diameter), we are trying to limit the total number of PMTs needed for a full-scale PET scanner with a large axial field-of-view. Therefore, we have designed and tested a pulse shaping circuit to improve the detector response and performance at high count rate. Simulations of a complete LaBr/sub 3/ scanner indicate significant improvements in noise equivalent count rate (NEC) and spatial resolution can be achieved using pulse shaping.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2006.873708","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/34477/01645000.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2006.873708","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34477","startPage":"1090","endPage":"1095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance assessment of pixelated LaBr/sub 3/ detector modules for time-of-flight PET","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1645000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance assessment of pixelated LaBr/sub 3/ detector modules for time-of-flight PET","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1645000/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"8982346","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1645000/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance assessment of pixelated LaBr/sub 3/ detector modules for time-of-flight PET","sourcePdf":"01645000.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057222S","chronDate":"June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"34477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"34477","articleId":"1645000","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1645010,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The DAQ system is composed of several readout cards, each one associated with a module of the PET scanner, and of a main card that controls the whole system. Using fast triggering signals from the silicon sensor back-planes, the main card performs the coincidence analysis and, in case of coincidence, it enables the readout of the two modules involved. The other modules are left free to perform new acquisitions. This concept based on several independent, event-driven and parallel readout chains, drastically reduces the acquisition dead time. Each enabled readout card digitizes, encodes and stores data from the associated module. Data are stored in a local FIFO and then are transferred through a network into a single computer. The system is designed according to the specifications of the IDEAS VaTaGP5 chip. Each readout card is able to accommodate all the chip readout modes and the test procedures and can be used as a standalone readout system that allows reading out up to 16 daisy chained chips per channel. The DAQ system here reported, designed for a two module demonstrator setup, was developed to study and optimize the essential design parameters.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2006.875149","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/34477/01645010.pdf","startPage":"1156","endPage":"1161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2006.875149","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1645010","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1645010/","displayDocTitle":"An event driven read-out system for a novel PET scanner with Compton enhanced 3-D gamma reconstruction","volume":"53","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"8982356","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1645010/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An event driven read-out system for a novel PET scanner with Compton enhanced 3-D gamma reconstruction","sourcePdf":"01645010.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060982S","chronDate":"June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"34477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"34477","articleId":"1645010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1645061,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Indeed, irrelevant and noisy features unnecessarily increase the complexity of the problem and can degrade the diagnostic performance. In this paper, the problem of choosing among the several measured plant parameters those to be used for efficient, early transient diagnosis is tackled by means of genetic algorithms. Three different schemes for simultaneously performing the feature selection and the training of an empirical diagnostic classifier are presented. The first approach employs a single objective genetic algorithm to search the vector of features optimal with respect to the classification performance of a Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbors classifier. With reference to the same classifier, the second and third approaches embrace a multi-objective perspective to find feature sets that achieve high classification performances with low numbers of features. In all cases, validation of the performance of the classifiers based on the optimal feature subsets identified by the genetic algorithm is successively carried out with respect to transients never used during the feature selection phase. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is tested on a diagnostic problem regarding the classification of simulated transients in the feedwater system of a Boiling Water Reactor.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2006.873868","startPage":"1479","endPage":"1493","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2006.873868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34478","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/34478/01645062.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selecting features for nuclear transients classification by means of genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1645062/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Selecting features for nuclear transients classification by means of genetic algorithms","volume":"53","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1645062/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8982402","publicationDate":"June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selecting features for nuclear transients classification by means of genetic algorithms","sourcePdf":"01645062.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130178S","chronDate":"June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"34478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"34478","articleId":"1645062","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1645076,"authors":[{"name":"V.

This combined and synergic use of information yields a promising tool for solving design problems that require the optimization of a relatively large number of parameters. In this letter, the problem of synthesizing frequency selective surfaces (FSSs) is addressed by using a specifically derived particle swarm optimization procedure, which is able to handle, simultaneously, both real and binary parameters.

This technique enables the handling of biological materials, such as cells, bacteria, DNA, and drug packets, in a hand-held format using simple and easy-to-fabricate actuators. The feedback loop consists of a vision system which identifies the positions of the particles in real-time, a control algorithm that computes the actuator (electrode) inputs based on information received from the vision system, and a set of electrodes (actuators) that create the required flow through electro-osmotic forces to steer all the particles along their desired trajectories and correct for particle position errors and thermal noise. Here, we focus on the development of control algorithms to achieve the steering of particles: vision system implementation, fabrication of devices, and experimental validation is addressed in other publications. In particular, steering of a single (yeast cell) particle has been demonstrated experimentally in our prior research and we have recently demonstrated experimental steering of three particles independently. In this paper, we develop the control algorithms for steering multiple particles independently and we validate our control techniques using simulations with realistic sources of initial position errors and thermal noise. In this study, we assume perfect measurement and actuation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1645118/","volume":"14","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1645118/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8976409","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Arbitrary steering of multiple particles independently in an electro-osmotically driven microfluidic system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arbitrary steering of multiple particles independently in an electro-osmotically driven microfluidic system","sourcePdf":"01645118.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102693S","chronDate":"July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"34479","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"34479","articleId":"1645118","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1645121,"authors":[{"name":"Poi Loon Tang","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering Department, University of British Columbia, Canada, ON"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/34479/1645121/1645121-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Poi Loon Tang (S'00\u2013M'06) received the B.Eng. degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Malaya, Malaysia, in 1998, the M.Eng. degree in mechanical engineering from the National University of Singapore,in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada in 2005.","He was a Research and Development Engineer in electronics packaging with Carsem Semiconductor Pte.

This paper presents a novel strategy, which extends the Generalized Predictive Control (GPC) algorithm to compensate for these data-transmission delays. Communication lines between sensors to controller and controller to actuators are considered. The present strategy incorporates a minimum-effort estimator to estimate missing or delayed sensor data and a variable-horizon adaptive GPC controller to predict the required future control efforts to drive the plant to track a desired reference trajectory. Action buffers are introduced at the actuators to sequence the future control efforts. A parallel objective of this paper is to investigate the suitability of the Ethernet network, which is cost-effective and widely deployed for implementing networked control systems. An Ethernet-based client-server control architecture is developed.

Determining directional simple loops (DSLs) and relative sequence groups (RSGs) is the prerequisite of traditional algorithms which are used to determine MBPS. In order to reduce the CPU time and complexity of calculating MBPS, a new concept named as protection relay dependency dimension (PRDD) is presented for the first time in this paper. By comparison of PRDD in a multiloop network, the MBPS can be determined, and the process of comparisons will not stop until the MBPS of the multiloop networks is discovered. In the meantime, the RSG could be easily determined by means of judging whether the primary protection relay set of a protection relay is null or not. The new algorithm leaves out those laborious steps, such as determining all of the DSLs and RSGs. Some examples are given to illuminate the novel algorithm presented in the paper to be simple and effective.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1645145/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8983540","volume":"21","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1645145/","publicationDate":"July 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A novel algorithm to determine minimum break point set for optimum cooperation of directional protection relays in multiloop networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel algorithm to determine minimum break point set for optimum cooperation of directional protection relays in multiloop networks","sourcePdf":"01645145.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057965S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"34480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"34480","articleId":"1645145","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":1645153,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The boundary protection is based on detecting distinct frequency bands contained in the transient fault current wave. Discrete wavelet transform, using db4 as a mother wavelet, is used to capture two bands of frequencies in the transient current signal. The spectral energies of these two bands are obtained and used to determine if the fault is internal or external to the protected zone. Fault classification is done using the discrete wavelet transform. Using Haar as the mother wavelet, the coefficients of a frequency band in the range of 1 kHz-3 kHz are obtained for the three phase and ground currents. The average value of the coefficients of each current wave is then computed and used to classify the faulted phases. The basic principle of the protection scheme is described and its response to the series-compensated transmission lines is studied for a wide range of compensation levels, fault conditions, fault types, and fault locations. The stability of the algorithm under various load switching cases is also tested. Fault simulations are performed using power system computer-aided design/electromagnetic transient and direct current program and the results are then interfaced to MATLAB, where the algorithm is implemented. It is found that the proposed method gives reliable results in the boundary protection and fault classification of series-compensated lines.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2006.876981","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/34480/01645157.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2006.876981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34480","startPage":"1213","endPage":"1221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Usage of wavelet transform in the protection of series-compensated transmission lines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1645157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Usage of wavelet transform in the protection of series-compensated transmission lines","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1645157/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"8983552","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1645157/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Usage of wavelet transform in the protection of series-compensated transmission lines","sourcePdf":"01645157.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041285S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"34480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"34480","articleId":"1645157","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1645158,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Simulations are used to illustrate concepts, using a simulation engine called EPOCHS that combines the EMTDC/PSCAD power simulator with the NS2 network communications simulator. Results show the improved performance of our protection scheme. In this new protection system, agents were embedded in each of the conventional protection components to construct an IED relay. The agent searches for relevant information by communicating with other agents. Agent communication can take place at the same substation or at remote substations. This information can be used to detect primary and remote faults, relay misoperation, breaker failures, and to compensate such problems with a much better performance than can be done in traditional schemes.

Basically, it hits the overhead distribution line then propagates to the other network components, such as underground cables and transformers. Due to lightning strokes, insulation failure of such components could occur. The failure risk can be determined on the basis of network configuration, its parameters, and surge arresters data. The determination of this index can greatly help in optimizing the network surge protection. The implementation of an artificial neural network (ANN) for prediction of the failure risk for underground medium-voltage cables connected to overhead distribution lines is introduced. The main advantage of ANN actually is the time and effort savings due to the random nature of the problem and extended calculation process. The calculation of the failure risk using ANN is applied to a group of industrial surge arresters. The results of the ANN test coincide with the analytical ones.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2006.874643","startPage":"1278","endPage":"1282","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/34480/01645166.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2006.874643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34480","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Failure risk prediction using artificial neural networks for lightning surge protection of underground MV cables","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Lightning","Surge protection","Cables","Surges","Power distribution lines","Arresters","Power distribution","Optical propagation","Transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["failure analysis","underground distribution systems","risk analysis","neural nets","lightning protection","surge protection","underground cables","power overhead lines","power distribution lines","power distribution faults","power distribution protection","power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["failure risk prediction","artificial neural networks","lightning surge protection","underground MV cables","power distribution systems","overhead distribution line","lightning strokes","insulation failure","network surge protection","underground medium-voltage cables"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial neural networks (ANNs)","Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP)/Alternative Transients Program (ATP)","lightning surges","risk analysis","surge protection arresters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1645166/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","displayDocTitle":"Failure risk prediction using artificial neural networks for lightning surge protection of underground MV cables","volume":"21","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1645166/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","accessionNumber":"8983561","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Failure risk prediction using artificial neural networks for lightning surge protection of underground MV cables","sourcePdf":"01645166.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052237S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"34480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"34480","articleId":"1645166","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1645170,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This can be achieved by suitable combination of passive elements and active FACTS controllers. In this paper, series passive compensation and shunt active compensation provided by a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) connected at the electrical center of the transmission line are considered. It is possible to damp subsynchronous resonance (SSR) caused by series capacitors with the help of an auxiliary subsynchronous damping controller (SSDC) on STATCOM. The objective of this paper is to investigate the SSR characteristics of the system and propose a new design procedure for SSDC based on nonlinear optimization to meet the specifications on the damping torque in the range of critical torsional frequencies. The SSDC uses the Thevenin voltage signal to modulate the reactive current reference of STATCOM. The Thevenin voltage signal is derived from the locally available STATCOM bus voltage and reactive current signals. The STATCOM configurations considered in this paper are 12 pulse, two- and three-level voltage source converter with Type-2 and Type-1 control, respectively. The controller regulates either reactive current (supplied by the STATCOM) or the bus voltage. The 3-phase model of the STATCOM is based on switching functions. By neglecting harmonics in the switching function, D-Q model is derived which is combined with similar models of the other system components for linear analysis. The results of the linear analysis are validated by carrying out transient simulation based on the detailed nonlinear models. The study is performed on the system adapted from the IEEE First Benchmark Model.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2005.861332","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","startPage":"1398","endPage":"1405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2005.861332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34480","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/34480/01645181.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Automatic voltage control","Voltage control","Power transmission lines","Load flow control","Shunt (electrical)","Resonance","Capacitors","Design optimization","Torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","static VAr compensators","load flow control","flexible AC transmission systems","torque","power transmission control","control system synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","subsynchronous damping controller","STATCOM","transmission line","power flow control","voltage regulation","FACTS controllers","static synchronous compensator","subsynchronous resonance","nonlinear optimization","damping torque","reactive current reference","three-level voltage source converter","switching functions","linear analysis","transient simulation","IEEE first benchmark model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Damping torque","eigenvalue","FACTS","static synchronous compensator (STATCOM)","subsynchronous damping controller (SSDC)","subsynchronous resonance (SSR)","torsional interaction (TI)","voltage source converter (VSC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design and performance evaluation of subsynchronous damping controller with STATCOM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1645181/","volume":"21","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1645181/","accessionNumber":"8983576","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","publicationDate":"July 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and performance evaluation of subsynchronous damping controller with STATCOM","sourcePdf":"01645181.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084892S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"34480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"34480","articleId":"1645181","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1645183,"authors":[{"name":"C.

As a consequence, new concepts for limiting short-circuit currents are required. One possible solution is based on resonant circuits. These circuits are able to limit short-circuit currents fast, at preset levels. Four different circuits will be presented and compared with regard to technical aspects. In order to integrate new technologies into present power systems, costs are a decisive factor. In this paper, a complete Life Cycle Cost (LCC) analysis is carried out. It will be shown that, the design of resonant circuits offers some degree of freedom, which gives the opportunity to design circuits at minimal costs. The optimized solution strongly depends on the economical life time, which is assumed to be 10 or 20 years in present power systems. Finally, these costs are compared with solid-state circuit breakers, which are able to turn-off a short-circuit within a few 100 /spl mu/s.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1645183/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"8983578","htmlLink":"/document/1645183/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"LCC analysis of different resonant circuits and solid-state circuit breakers for medium-voltage grids","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LCC analysis of different resonant circuits and solid-state circuit breakers for medium-voltage grids","sourcePdf":"01645183.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033373S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"34480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"34480","articleId":"1645183","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1645188,"authors":[{"name":"L.F.

Conventionally, the compensation currents injected by the APF are determined to eliminate harmonic currents of the nonlinear load as well as to compensate reactive power and maintain the sinusoidal source currents. However, the subject related to the optimal control of the APF to meet the IEEE-519 harmonic current limits and other constraints, such as minimum load power factor requirement after compensation with an optimal kilovolt-ampere rating, are rarely investigated. In this paper, an optimization-based solution algorithm is proposed to determine the three-phase three-wire APF current injections to meet different constraints with an optimal filter size, where the voltage compensation-based control strategy is formulated as a nonlinear programming problem and is solved to find the optimal compensator gains and APF current injections.

The accuracy assessment relied on two methods: a confidence-building method (quality control based on a comparison with ancillary data) and a quantitative accuracy assessment based on a stratified random sampling of reference data. The sample site stratification used an underlying grid of Landsat data and was based on the proportion of priority land cover classes and on the landscape complexity. A total of 1265 sample sites have been interpreted. The first results indicate an overall accuracy of 68.6%. The GLC2000 validation exercise has provided important experiences. The design-based inference conforms to the CEOS Cal-Val recommendations and has proven to be successful. Both the GLC2000 legend development and reference data interpretations used the FAO Land Cover Classification System (LCCS). Problems in the validation process were identified for areas with heterogeneous land cover. This issue appears in both in the GLC2000 (neighborhood pixel variations) and in the reference data (cartographic and thematic mixed units).

General concepts and practical issues are illustrated by the validation of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) active fire product in Siberia. Coincident Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) imagery is used to characterize spatial patterns of flaming at sub-MODIS pixel scale. It is shown that for proper evaluation reference fire observations are needed at the scale of the satellite pixel, as only 60% of the MODIS footprints contain single contiguous clusters of ASTER fire pixels. In Siberia the size of a single ASTER fire cluster within the MODIS footprint that has a 50% probability of being flagged as \"fire\" is ~60, compared to ~45 in the Brazilian Amazon, whereas previous radiative transfer simulations suggested similar detection probabilities. The lower-than-expected detection rates in Siberia are largely attributable to flaming underneath heavy smoke, which is not detected by the current MODIS algorithm. Pixel-based and cluster-based omission error rates are derived, and it is shown that the probability of flagging as \"fire\" a MODIS pixel which contains a given number of 30-m ASTER fire pixels is typically 3-5 times lower than detecting a contiguous cluster with the same number of ASTER fire pixels. The procedures described are recommended for a consensus active fire validation protocol, but with the inclusion of multiplatform sensor configurations to complement the near-nadir angular sampling from single-platform observations such as MODIS and ASTER on Terra","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1645276/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1645276/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2006","publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"8962296","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"44","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Validation of active fire detection from moderate-resolution satellite sensors: the MODIS example in northern eurasia","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Validation of active fire detection from moderate-resolution satellite sensors: the MODIS example in northern eurasia","sourcePdf":"01645276.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075253S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"34482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"34482","articleId":"1645276","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":1645277,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The objective of such a scheme is to assess the margins of uncertainty associated with the burned area products and to estimate calibration coefficients needed to convert burned pixel counts into areal estimates. As the validation of GBA2000 was performed long after 2000, and given the fact that burned areas are a predominantly nonpermanent land cover change, the reference data are obtained from a set of Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus high-resolution remotely sensed data. A stratified sampling scheme is presented, specifically designed for the retrospective validation of burned area data; the scheme is based on combining information from two low-resolution burned area products (GBA2000 itself and Globscar). The resulting stratification has been applied to the whole global GBA2000 dataset, and preliminary validation results are reported for Africa.

We used independently derived NDVI from atmospherically corrected ETM+ data at 13 Earth Observation System Land Validation core sites, eight locations of drought, and globally aggregated one-degree data from the four coarse resolution sensors to assess the NDVI records agreement. The objectives of this paper are to: 1) compare the absolute and relative differences of the vegetation signal across these sensors from a user perspective, and, to a lesser degree, 2) evaluate the possibility of merging the AVHRR historical data record with that of the more modern sensors in order to provide historical perspective on current vegetation activities. The statistical and correlation analyses demonstrate that due to the similarity in their overall variance, it is not necessary to choose between the longer time series of AVHRR and the higher quality of the more modern sensors. The long-term AVHRR-NDVI record provides a critical historical perspective on vegetation activities necessary for global change research and, thus, should be the basis of an intercalibrated, sensor-independent NDVI data record.

One subgroup of CEOS WGCV, Land Product Validation (LPV), was established in 2000 to define standard validation guidelines and protocols and to foster data and information exchange relevant to the validation of land products. Since then, a number of leaf area index (LAI) products have become available to the science community at both global and regional extents. Having multiple global LAI products and multiple, disparate validation activities related to these products presents the opportunity to realize efficiency through international collaboration. So the LPV subgroup established an international LAI intercomparison validation activity. This paper describes the main components of this international validation effort. The paper documents the current participants, their ground LAI measurements and scaling techniques, and the metadata and infrastructure established to share data. The paper concludes by describing plans for sharing both field data and high-resolution LAI products from each site.

While accurate simulations are required for reducing programming current and enabling higher integration density, many challenges remain for improved simulation of PRAM cell operation including nanoscale thermal conduction and phase change. This work simulates the fully coupled electrical and thermal transport and phase change in 2D PRAM geometries, with specific attention to the impact of thermal boundary resistance between the GST and surrounding materials. For GST layer thicknesses between 25 and 75nm, the interface resistance reduces the predicted programming current and power by 31% and 53%, respectively, for a typical reset transition. The calculations also show the large sensitivity of programming voltage to the GST thermal conductivity. These results show the importance of temperature-dependent thermal properties of materials and interfaces in PRAM cells","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1645329/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2006-June 2 2006","publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1645329/","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","accessionNumber":"9085423","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multiphysics Modeling and Impact of Thermal Boundary Resistance in Phase Change Memory Devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiphysics Modeling and Impact of Thermal Boundary Resistance in Phase Change Memory Devices","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01645329.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081335S","chronDate":"May 30 2006-June 2 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10950","isNumber":"34484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10950","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"34484","articleId":"1645329","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1645343,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Traditional systems utilize computer room air conditioning (CRAC) units to pressurize a raised floor plenum with cool air that is passed to equipment racks via ventilation tiles distributed throughout the raised floor. Temperature is typically controlled at the hot air return of the CRAC units away from the equipment racks. Due primarily to a lack of distributed environmental sensing, these CRAC systems are often operated conservatively resulting in reduced computational density and added operational expense. This paper introduces a data center environmental control system that utilizes a distributed sensor network to manipulate conventional CRAC units within an air-cooled environment. The sensor network is attached to standard racks and provides a direct measurement of the environment in close proximity to the computational resources. A calibration routine is used to characterize the response of each sensor in the network to individual CRAC actuators. A cascaded control algorithm is used to evaluate the data from the sensor network and manipulate supply air temperature and flow rate from individual CRACs to ensure thermal management while reducing operational expense. The combined controller and sensor network has been deployed in a production data center environment. Results from the algorithm will be presented that demonstrate the performance of the system and evaluate the energy savings compared with conventional data center environmental control architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2006-June 2 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1645377/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9061326","publicationDate":"2006","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1645377/","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic thermal management of air cooled data centers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic thermal management of air cooled data centers","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01645377.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048823S","chronDate":"May 30 2006-June 2 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10950","isNumber":"34484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10950","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"34484","articleId":"1645377","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1645408,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.

In 3D die-stacking approach, the Cu vertical interconnections are fabricated on the front-side of the silicon wafer along with the active circuitry followed by wafer thinning and die-stacking. The limitation of this approach is the impact to active circuitry from vertical interconnects processing. With the 3D wafer stacking approach, the wafers are bonded with the prefabricated active circuitry face-to-face prior to wafer thinning and Cu interconnects fabrication and inherently limit stack die configuration to matched die sizes. This approach has inherent benefits and limitations depend to a large extent on the targeted applications. In this paper, we present an alternate 3D die-stacking approach which involves wafer thinning prior to Cu interconnect fabrication in a silicon wafer consisting of pre-fabricated active circuitry. This approach allows for mixed die size and technology node integration in multi-chip packages while maximizing known good die yields.

Novel capabilities of SOP are expected to enable lower cost, more efficient and higher performance electronic systems. Newly developed technology elements include: electrical silicon through-vias, fine-pitch, high bandwidth wiring, fine pitch solder interconnection, fine pitch known-good-die, and advanced microchannel cooling. Applications may range from miniaturized consumer products such as integrated function cell phones to high performance computers. SOP technology and related chip stacking challenges have been investigated and robust technology options are reported. Silicon through-vias can be fabricated using copper, tungsten, composite or alternate conductors. Via design and structure are discussed for vias in thin silicon packages mounted on a supporting substrate as well as thick silicon package that can be handled without a supporting substrate. Fine-pitch, high bandwidth wiring has been fabricated, characterized and shows greatest bandwidth for shorter interconnection distances. Fine pitch area array solder interconnections have been fabricated and characterized electrically, mechanically and with accelerated reliability testing. These fine pitch interconnections can enable the high bandwidth wiring for chip-to-chip interconnection. Integrated decoupling capacitors have been fabricated using parallel plate and trench technology. The integrated decoupling capacitors can provide under-chip, low inductance bypassing to minimize noise from simultaneous switching noise. New fine pitch, area array test technology provides a path to wafer level test for known-good-die, functional test, and burn-in for the fine pitch chip I/O. Advanced microchannel cooling can be leveraged to support high power, close proximity chips and chip stacks for cooling > 300 W/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.

Today, scaling is becoming increasingly difficult and less effective, and a range of new two- and three-dimensional silicon integration technologies are needed to support next-generation systems. A silicon-carrier system-on-package (SOP) is an advanced packaging solution, enabling interconnection between ICs and other devices at densities far beyond those of current first-level packaging. Silicon-carrier employs fine pitch Cu damascene wiring, high-density solder pads/joins and high-yielding electrical through-vias. A novel approach to fabricating robust though-vias in silicon is described. The key design feature enabling large-area, uniform arrays to be produced with high yield is the annular via shape. As compared to a standard cylindrical via shape, the annular via is easier to integrate into a standard CMOS copper back-end-of-the-line (BEOL) process flow. Two process flows are compared: the first having the conductor metal within the gap of the insulated annulus itself, the second having a conducting metal core enclosed within the inner wall of the annulus. For the first process flow, two annular conductors, plated copper and CVD tungsten, are compared in terms of ease of integration, yield and susceptibility to failure during thermal stressing. Large area (45 times 48 mm) silicon carrier modules containing more than 51,000 electrically measurable through-vias are used to compare overall yield and robustness of each process. Results on deep thermal cycling, current carrying capacity and thermomechanical modeling are discussed. Wafer-level via testing is used to statistically distinguish between via chain opens caused by bond and assembly issues versus failures in the vias or integrated wiring structures. Through-via resistances on the order of ~10 mOmega are typical, and through-via yields of 99.98% at module level have been demonstrated","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2006.1645754","publicationTitle":"56th Electronic Components and Technology Conference 2006","displayPublicationTitle":"56th Electronic Components and Technology Conference 2006","pdfPath":"/iel5/10951/34490/01645754.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2006.1645754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34490","startPage":"7 pp.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CMOS-compatible process for fabricating electrical through-vias in silicon","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1645754","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS-compatible process for fabricating electrical through-vias in silicon","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1645754/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9075395","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1645754/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS-compatible process for fabricating electrical through-vias in silicon","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01645754.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054079S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"10951","isNumber":"34490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10951","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"34490","articleId":"1645754","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1645775,"authors":[{"name":"Bao Yang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Bao Yang","id":"37629609200"},{"name":"Peng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Peng Wang","id":"37634820400"},{"name":"A.

More aggressive thermal solutions, than would be required for uniform heating, are highly desired. Solid state thermoelectric coolers (TECs) have received recent attention for hot-spot thermal management. However, present day TECs typically have cooling flux much lower than heat flux in the hot-spots. In this work, we reported an innovative technique - TE mini-contact - to significantly increase cooling flux of TECs for the application in hot-spot cooling. A chip package featuring a TE mini-contact cooler integrated with conventional integrated heat spreader (IHS) and heat sink is designed. The cooling performance of such chip package has been investigated by using a 3-D numeric model.

A wide variety of devices and electrical parts are used to enhance their performance. As the consumption of electrical energy of the equipment has increased, several small-sized DC-DC converters have been used as power sources to supply suitable voltage to the device efficiently. And, further miniaturization of the DC-DC converter is demanded. The current DC-DC converter consists of an IC and several surface mounted components on a PCB, and they are modularized. The main factor in miniaturization and low profile of the DC-DC converter is the size of chip inductors. It has been difficult for chip inductor suppliers to satisfy both low profile and high inductance. We have developed the LTCC (low temperature co-fired ceramic) substrate with embedded high value inductor to achieve further miniaturization and low profile of the DC-DC converter. The substrate size is from 3 mm SQ. to 5 mm SQ. A high value inductor from 1 muH to 10 muH is embedded with the low temperature co-fired ferrite material using multilayer technology. Use of Ag conductor makes it possible to achieve low resistance of the inductor pattern. The DC-DC converter can be miniaturized, because the devices and the chip components can be mounted on both surfaces of the substrate. This paper describes the structure of the inductor embedded substrate, the ferrite material, the inductor design, and the electrical characteristics, and the results of reliability tests","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1645827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1645827/","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2006","accessionNumber":"9061386","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"New substrate for micro DC-DC converter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New substrate for micro DC-DC converter","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01645827.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045532S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"10951","isNumber":"34490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10951","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"34490","articleId":"1645827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1645830,"authors":[{"name":"U.

The need for miniaturization has led to new architectures, which combine disparate technologies. In particular, when several die have to be connected in a small package, stacking would appear to be the best solution. However, this 3D packaging approach has to satisfy the constraints of high interconnection density and high data throughput in conjunction with good signal integrity, and reliability while maintaining a low cost. Today, several different approaches have been developed in order to perform 3D packaging. These include technologies like SiP (system in package), SoC (system on chip) or SoP (system on package) based in R. R. Tummala et al. (2002). A concept for heterogeneous integration has been developed by CEA-LETI and is called SoW (system on wafer) as presented in N. Sillon et al. (2005). In this paper, the system on wafer concept (SoW) is presented. In order to perform heterogeneous integration by using the SoW, a technological toolbox is required. This toolbox is presented with a focus on the silicon through vias technology (STV). Then, the complete technology for the STV is presented.

Popcorning in plastic-encapsulated IC packages is a defect frequently occurring in solder reflow due to moisture penetration into the packages. Moisture diffusion has a detrimental effect on the epoxy/copper interfacial adhesion and drastically reduces the reliability of the encapsulated package. The present study is focused on the moisture diffusion in both the epoxy molding compound (EMC) and the EMC/Cu interface. In order to evaluate which is the dominating moisture transport mechanism at the interface, molecular dynamic (MD) models were built using the 'Materials studio' software. Based on the conditions of 85degC/85%RH in qualifying tests in humidity chamber, the amount of water molecules are assigned to the packing cells in the MD models. All the MD simulations were performed at a temperature of 85degC using the constant-pressure and temperature ensemble (NPT). Non-bond interactions cut-off distance of 1.5 nm with a smooth switching function was used in all simulations. The simulation in each case study was performed with an interval of 1 femto second (fs) in each MD simulation step. The mean squared displacements of all water molecules were evaluated in each time-step to track the motion of the molecules. Constants of moisture diffusion in both bulk EMC material and EMC/Cu interface can be derived from the mean squared displacements. The MD results show that the value of the moisture diffusion coefficient at the EMC/Cu interface is higher than that in the bulk EMC material. It revealed that moisture can easily penetrate along the EMC/Cu interface. The MD simulation study has demonstrated that the seepage along the interface is the dominant mechanism for moisture diffusion into the EMC/Cu interface in plastic packages. This widely studied mechanism of moisture diffusion via the bulk EMC is an apparent a secondary moisture penetration path to the interface","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2006.1645843","publicationTitle":"56th Electronic Components and Technology Conference 2006","displayPublicationTitle":"56th Electronic Components and Technology Conference 2006","pdfPath":"/iel5/10951/34490/01645843.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2006.1645843","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34490","startPage":"4 pp.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Moisture diffusion study in electronic packaging using molecular dynamic simulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1645843","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Moisture diffusion study in electronic packaging using molecular dynamic simulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1645843/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9075462","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1645843/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Moisture diffusion study in electronic packaging using molecular dynamic simulation","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01645843.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088414S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"10951","isNumber":"34490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10951","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"34490","articleId":"1645843","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1645891,"authors":[{"name":"F.Y.

The degradation of error vector magnitude and sideband suppression due to the presence of package and PCB can be well predicted by the co-simulation results and then verified by the final measurement results","displayPublicationTitle":"56th Electronic Components and Technology Conference 2006","pdfPath":"/iel5/10951/34490/01645891.pdf","startPage":"6 pp.","publicationTitle":"56th Electronic Components and Technology Conference 2006","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2006.1645891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2006.1645891","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34490","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1645891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of a W-CDMA direct-conversion IQ modulator module including evaluation of chip-package-board interactions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","MMICs","Packaging","Phase shifters","Differential amplifiers","Phase modulation","Low pass filters","Inductance","Capacitance","Circuit testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chip-on-board packaging","code division multiple access","integrated circuit interconnections","MMIC","modulators","printed circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["W-CDMA modulator module","direct-conversion IQ modulator module","chip-package-board interactions","MMIC design","phase shift","PCB effects","IQ modulator MMIC","package interconnects","PCB interconnects","3D EM simulation tool","equivalent-circuit elements","error vector magnitude","sideband suppression"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1645891/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of a W-CDMA direct-conversion IQ modulator module including evaluation of chip-package-board interactions","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1645891/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9075499","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of a W-CDMA direct-conversion IQ modulator module including evaluation of chip-package-board interactions","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01645891.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081927S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"10951","isNumber":"34490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10951","xplore-issue":"34490","articleId":"1645891","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1645957,"authors":[{"name":"E.F.W.

The arrangement of windings of the amplifier is such that the controlling winding has no radio frequency E. M. F. induced in it, nor does it induce currents in the radio frequency coils. Various arrangements of this amplifier in connection with a solid steel rotor, radio frequency alternator are shown, notably those in series with the alternator and those in parallel. \"Short-circuiting\" condensers are connected to each of the radio frequency coils. A shunt condenser across both coils and their \"short-circuiting\" condensers increases the sensitiveness for reasons which are given. Another condenser inserted in series with the entire amplifier is employed to obtain linear proportionality of amplification and increased sensitiveness. The ratio of amplification is found to be proportional to the ratio of the frequency of the radio current to that of the controlling current. The control of the output of a 75 K.

There are formed, in general, in coupled circuits two waves in both primary and secondary circuits. The amplitude ratios of the longer two of these waves and of the shorter two of these waves are calculated. Neglecting resistance, the shorter waves are opposite in phase, the longer waves in phase. A simple experimental method for rapidly verifying the theoretical relations is described. The ratios of the amplitude of the longer to the shorter primary wave and of the longer to the shorter secondary wave are theoretically determined for both condenser excitation and inductance excitation. It is shown that at resonance the magnetic fluxes of corresponding long or corresponding short waves are equal numerically. It also appears that maximum secondary effect is not obtained for equal natural periods of the circuits. The extent to which wave meter close coupling affects accuracy of wave length determination is considered. An explanation of dissymmetry of resonance curves about the resonance point is also given. All relations deduced are graphically illustrated.","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1916.217244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1916.217244","startPage":"283","endPage":"300","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547934/34493/01645977.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34493","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplitude Relations in Coupled Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June 1916","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1916","displayDocTitle":"Amplitude Relations in Coupled Circuits","publicationDate":"June 1916","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2006","volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1645977/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplitude Relations in Coupled Circuits","sourcePdf":"01645977.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041774S","chronDate":"June 1916","isNumber":"34493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5547934","citationCount":"1","articleId":"1645977","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1916","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1645990,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Many recent analyses, particularly queueing models, have used mathematically convenient program models. For example, in one popular model the times between page faults are assumed to be exponentially distributed and independent. However, such a program model is inaccurate, which may cause the analysis to be unrepresentative of the real world. Simulation models of systems, on the other hand, have relied largely on traces of actual programs. Such traces are undoubtedly more accurate than simple mathematical models, but they have several drawbacks. They are expensive to generate, they may not be truly representative of typical programs, and they may contain more detail than is necessary for accurate system modeling. Moreover, it is difficult to extrapolate their behavior to other similar programs.","doi":"10.1109/C-M.1976.218435","pdfPath":"/iel5/2/34541/01647210.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"20","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","publicationTitle":"Computer","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/C-M.1976.218435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distance String Models for Program Behavior","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1647210/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1976","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1976","displayDocTitle":"Distance String Models for Program Behavior","volume":"9","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2006","publicationDate":"Nov. 1976","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distance String Models for Program Behavior","sourcePdf":"01647210.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021766S","chronDate":"Nov.  1976","isNumber":"34541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"25","articleId":"1647210","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1647388,"authors":[{"name":"R.G.

The execution of tasks is deemed primarily energy-driven, i.e., a task may only respect its deadline if its energy demand can be satisfied early enough. Hence, a useful scheduling policy should account for properties of the energy source, capacity of the energy storage as well as power dissipation of the single tasks. We show that conventional scheduling algorithms (like e.g. EDF) are not suitable for this scenario. Based on this motivation, we state and prove optimal scheduling algorithms that jointly handle constraints from both energy and time domain. Furthermore, an offline schedulability test for a set of periodic or even bursty tasks is presented. Finally, we validate the proposed theory by means of simulation and compare our algorithms with the classical earliest deadline first algorithm","doi":"10.1109/ECRTS.2006.23","displayPublicationTitle":"18th Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems (ECRTS'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10955/34554/01647744.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECRTS.2006.23","publicationTitle":"18th Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems (ECRTS'06)","startPage":"10 pp.","endPage":"270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time scheduling with regenerative energy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1647744","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Real-time scheduling with regenerative energy","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1647744/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1647744/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9089528","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time scheduling with regenerative energy","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"01647744.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055783S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"10955","isNumber":"34554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10955","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"34554","articleId":"1647744","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1647818,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The benefit of an established discipline is more impact, both in teaching (curricula) and research (e.g., framework programmes of the European Union).

In a multi-hop wireless network comprised of CR-enabled devices, medium access control (MAC) layer scheduling for data communication involves assignment of timeslots and channels to either links or nodes in the network. The number of channels available and the channel identities vary from one node to another within the CR network. This is in contrast to the existing use of multiple channels where all the nodes have the same set of channels available (for example in IEEE 802.11 networks).

Radio resource allocation in OFDMA can exploit multiuser diversity to increase system capacity by implementing opportunistic scheduling techniques. This paper presents a new opportunistic scheduling scheme for OFDMA-based wireless multimedia networks. We focus the scheduling algorithm on the class of delay-sensitive packets that belong to interactive applications such as telephony and video streaming. We divide the scheduling decision into two sub-problems: the OFDMA subcarrier allocation and subsequently the subcarrier assignment. Both the sub-carrier allocation and assignment algorithms exploit multiuser diversity and are designed to provide fairness with respect to the realizable throughput per user, packet dropping ratios and packet delay distributions. We investigate various performance aspects of the proposed scheduling algorithm using actual MPEG-4 traffic traces under different system loading and requested deadline values. The results show the superiority of the proposed scheduling scheme and its excellent performance with respect to throughput, packet dropping, and delay distributions","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic scheduling of delay sensitive traffic in OFDMA-based wireless networks","publicationTitle":"2006 International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks(WoWMoM'06)","doi":"10.1109/WOWMOM.2006.81","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks(WoWMoM'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10963/34562/01648469.pdf","startPage":"10 pp.","endPage":"288","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOWMOM.2006.81","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34562","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1648469","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1648469/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic scheduling of delay sensitive traffic in OFDMA-based wireless networks","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1648469/","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2006","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9098588","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic scheduling of delay sensitive traffic in OFDMA-based wireless networks","confLoc":"Buffalo-Niagara Falls, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01648469.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.139607S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"10963","isNumber":"34562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10963","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"34562","articleId":"1648469","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1648470,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-J.

In emerging multichannel systems, the perchannel feedback induces a substantial amount of feedback overhead and requires high computational complexity. To reduce the feedback overhead, we consider an opportunistic feedback strategy that activates the channel feedback opportunistically according to the channel condition. Then, we combine the opportunistic feedback with the best-n channel feedback scheme where a mobile user chooses the best n channels and transfers this information to the base station. We analyze the throughput and the amount of channel feedback information for proportionally fair opportunistic scheduling under Rayleigh fading i.i.d. channels.

It is essential to accurately estimate the interconnect performance and power gains achievable by these options and to understand the various trade-offs involved between the different metrics of interest. In this paper, an exhaustive comparison in terms of representative performance, energy and density metrics has been carried out among the different options for global interconnects. This analysis shows that 3D interconnects offer an attractive option to reduce the energy dissipation and propagation delay of long on-chip wires (51% and 54% reduction in latency and energy dissipation respectively at 45nm node). This analysis also shows that optical interconnects offer reduced latency compared to scaled Cu/low-k technologies but they do not offer significant improvement compared to other technologies like WLP interconnects (Beyne, 2003). It also follows from the analysis that CNT interconnects compare favorably to scaled Cu/low-k interconnects in terms of latency with a 42% reduction in delay","doi":"10.1109/IITC.2006.1648688","publicationTitle":"2006 International Interconnect Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Interconnect Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/10964/34566/01648688.pdf","startPage":"202","endPage":"204","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IITC.2006.1648688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34566","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1648688","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Comparison of Interconnect Technology and Architecture Options for Deep Submicron Technology Nodes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1648688/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Comparison of Interconnect Technology and Architecture Options for Deep Submicron Technology Nodes","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1648688/","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","conferenceDate":"5-7 June 2006","accessionNumber":"9088851","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Comparison of Interconnect Technology and Architecture Options for Deep Submicron Technology Nodes","confLoc":"Burlingame, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01648688.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061754S","chronDate":"5-7 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10964","isNumber":"34566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10964","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"34566","articleId":"1648688","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1648693,"authors":[{"name":"A.

To deal with the complex behaviors of today\u2019s multi-tier applications running across shared platforms, such monitoring must meet three criteria: (1) fine granularity, including being able to track the resource usage of specific application behaviors like individual client-server interactions, (2) real-time response, referring to the monitoring system\u2019s ability to both capture and analyze currently needed monitoring information with the delays required for online management, and (3) enterprise-wide operation, which means that the monitoring information captured and analyzed must span across the entire software stack and set of machines involved in request generation, request forwarding, service provision, and return. This paper presents the SysProf system-level monitoring toolkit, which provides a flexible, low overhead framework for enterprise-wide monitoring. The toolkit permits the capture of monitoring information at different levels of granularity, ranging from tracking the system-level activities triggered by a single system call, to capturing the client-server interactions associated with certain request classes, to characterizing the server resources consumed by sets of clients or client behaviors. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of SysProf by using it to manage two different enterprise applications: (1) detecting performance bottlenecks in a high performance shared network file service, and (2) enforcing service level agreements in a multi-tier auctioning web site.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1648795/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1648795/","conferenceDate":"4-7 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"SysProf: Online Distributed Behavior Diagnosis through Fine-grain System Monitoring","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SysProf: Online Distributed Behavior Diagnosis through Fine-grain System Monitoring","confLoc":"Lisboa, Portugal","sourcePdf":"01648795.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05534S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10967","isNumber":"34569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10967","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"34569","articleId":"1648795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1648799,"authors":[{"name":"T.S.J.

We use m/n erasure-correcting coding to safeguard the stored data and use algebraic signatures hash functions with algebraic properties for verification. Our scheme primarily utilizes one such algebraic property: taking a signature of parity gives the same result as taking the parity of the signatures. To make our scheme collusionresistant, we blind data and parity by XORing them with a pseudo-random stream. Our scheme has three advantages over existing techniques. First, it uses only small messages for verification, an attractive property in a P2P setting where the storing peers often only have a small upstream pipe. Second, it allows verification of challenges across random data without the need for the challenger to compare against the original data. Third, it is highly resistant to coordinated attempts to undetectably modify data. These signature techniques are very fast, running at tens to hundreds of megabytes per second. Because of these properties, the use of algebraic signatures will permit the construction of large-scale distributed storage systems in which large amounts of storage can be verified with minimal network bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS.2006.80","publicationTitle":"26th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"26th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10967/34569/01648799.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2006.80","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34569","startPage":"12","endPage":"12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Store, Forget, and Check: Using Algebraic Signatures to Check Remotely Administered Storage","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1648799","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Store, Forget, and Check: Using Algebraic Signatures to Check Remotely Administered Storage","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1648799/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 July 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1648799/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Store, Forget, and Check: Using Algebraic Signatures to Check Remotely Administered Storage","confLoc":"Lisboa, Portugal","sourcePdf":"01648799.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082932S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10967","isNumber":"34569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10967","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"34569","articleId":"1648799","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1648811,"authors":[{"name":"C.

We examine the problem of optimal resource allocation for such an infrastructure composed of an overlay of nodes. Resources, like CPU and network bandwidth, are consumed by both message flows and message consumers; therefore, we consider both rate control for flows and admission control for consumers. This makes the optimization problem difficult because the objective function is nonconcave and the constraint set is nonconvex. We present LRGP (Lagrangian Rates, Greedy Populations), a scalable and efficient distributed algorithm to maximize the total system utility. The key insight of our solution involves partitioning the optimization problem into two types of subproblems: a greedy allocation for consumer admission control and a Lagrangian allocation to compute the flow rates, and linking the subproblems in a manner that allows tradeoffs between consumer admission and flow rates while satisfying the nonconvex constraints. LRGP allows an autonomic approach to system management where nodes collaboratively optimize aggregate system performance. We evaluate the quality of results and convergence characteristics under various workloads.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Utility Optimization for Event-Driven Distributed Infrastructures","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS.2006.84","endPage":"24","displayPublicationTitle":"26th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10967/34569/01648811.pdf","publicationTitle":"26th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS'06)","startPage":"24","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2006.84","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34569","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1648811","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Admission control","Constraint optimization","Lagrangian functions","Resource management","Bandwidth","Distributed algorithms","Joining processes","Collaborative work","Aggregates","System performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Utility Optimization for Event-Driven Distributed Infrastructures","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1648811/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1648811/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","conferenceDate":"4-7 July 2006","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utility Optimization for Event-Driven Distributed Infrastructures","confLoc":"Lisboa, Portugal","sourcePdf":"01648811.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124001S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10967","isNumber":"34569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10967","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"34569","articleId":"1648811","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1648824,"authors":[{"name":"Fanglu Guo","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Fanglu Guo","id":"37266161200"},{"name":"Jiawu Chen","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Jiawu Chen","id":"37280685800"},{"name":"Tzi-cker Chiueh","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Tzi-cker Chiueh","id":"37273336700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2540-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6927"}],"articleNumber":"1648824","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":965},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer crime","Web server","Internet","Bandwidth","Domain Name System","Computer science","Quality of service","Protection","Current measurement","Prototypes"]}],"abstract":"The Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical element of the Internet infrastructure. Even a small part of the DNS infrastructure being unavailable for a very short period of time could potentially upset the entire Internet and is thus totally unacceptable. Unfortunately, because DNS queries and responses are mostly UDP-based, it is vulnerable to spoofing-based denial of service (DoS) attacks, which are difficult to defeat without incurring significant collateral damage. The key to thwart this type of DoS attacks is spoof detection, which enables selective discarding of spoofed DNS requests without jeopardizing the quality of service to legitimate requests. This paper presents spoof detection strategies for protecting DNS servers from DoS attacks. These strategies create some form of cookies for a DNS server to check if each incoming request is indeed from where the request packet says it is from. We have implemented them as a firewall module called DNS guard. Measurements on the current DNS guard prototype show that it can deliver up to 80K requests/sec to legitimate users in the presence of DoS attacks at the rate of 250K requests/sec.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spoof Detection for Preventing DoS Attacks against DNS Servers","publicationTitle":"26th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS'06)","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS.2006.78","displayPublicationTitle":"26th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10967/34569/01648824.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"37","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2006.78","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34569","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1648824","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1648824/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","displayDocTitle":"Spoof Detection for Preventing DoS Attacks against DNS Servers","conferenceDate":"4-7 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1648824/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spoof Detection for Preventing DoS Attacks against DNS Servers","confLoc":"Lisboa, Portugal","sourcePdf":"01648824.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08098S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10967","isNumber":"34569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10967","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"34569","articleId":"1648824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1648826,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Gao","affiliation":["Department of EECS, Northwestern University, USA"],"lastName":"Yan Gao","id":"37087214355"},{"name":"Zhichun Li","affiliation":["Department of EECS, Northwestern University, USA"],"lastName":"Zhichun Li","id":"37087213309"},{"name":"Yan Chen","affiliation":["Department of EECS, Northwestern University, USA"],"lastName":"Yan Chen","id":"37087212847"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2540-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6927"}],"articleNumber":"1648826","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":340},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1648826","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","High-speed networks","Telecommunication traffic","Scalability","Routing","Frequency","Aggregates","Bandwidth","Hardware"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICDCS.2006.6","publicationTitle":"26th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"26th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10967/34569/01648826.pdf","startPage":"39","endPage":"39","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2006.6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34569","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A DoS Resilient Flow-level Intrusion Detection Approach for High-speed Networks","abstract":"Global-scale attacks like viruses and worms are increasing in frequency, severity and sophistication, making it critical to detect outbursts at routers/gateways instead of end hosts.

However, accurate data aggregation is difficult due to the variation of sensor readings and due to the frequent communication failures. To address these difficulties, we propose a scalable and robust data aggregation algorithm. The novelty of our work includes two aspects. First, our algorithm exploits the mixture model and the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation. Hence, it captures the effects of aggregation over different scales while keeping the communication cost low. Second, our algorithm exploits loss-tolerant multi-path routing schemes. Hence, it obtains accurate statistical information even in the presence of high link and node failure rates. We demonstrate that our techniques reduce communication cost while retaining the precious statistical information otherwise neglected by other aggregation techniques. Our evaluation shows the proposed techniques are robust against link and node failures, and perform consistently well.","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS.2006.73","publicationTitle":"26th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"26th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10967/34569/01648856.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"69","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2006.73","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34569","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1648856","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable and Robust Aggregation Techniques for Extracting Statistical Information in Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1648856/","displayDocTitle":"Scalable and Robust Aggregation Techniques for Extracting Statistical Information in Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1648856/","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2006","conferenceDate":"4-7 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable and Robust Aggregation Techniques for Extracting Statistical Information in Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Lisboa, Portugal","sourcePdf":"01648856.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044967S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"10967","isNumber":"34569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10967","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"34569","articleId":"1648856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1648914,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

These radios are addressing the fact that spectrum is actually poorly utilized in many bands, in spite of the increasing demand for wireless connectivity. The new approaches to spectrum sharing make use of the advances in technology to implement new wireless systems that can share previously allocated spectra in such a way that the primary users of these spectra are not affected. Additionally, the allowed use of this band is on an unlicensed basis. Two methods that are being investigated to accomplish this task are the use of ultra wideband transmission and cognitive techniques. Ultra wideband transmission relies on the fact that if the bandwidth is increased, that reliable data transmission can occur even at power levels so low that primary radios in the same spectral bands are not affected. On the other hand the cognitive approach does not necessarily limit the transmission power, but rather attempts to share the spectra through a dynamic avoidance strategy. The opportunities and challenges of this new era in radio design are described along with the open questions in their implementation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["FCC","Radio spectrum management","Interference","Circuits and systems","Proximity effect","Cellular phones","Scalability","Frequency measurement","Licenses","Recycling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum sharing radios","wireless connectivity","wireless systems","ultra wideband transmission","cognitive techniques","data transmission reliability","cognitive approach","dynamic avoidance strategy"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1648988","doi":"10.1109/MCAS.2006.1648988","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/7384/34571/01648988.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCAS.2006.1648988","startPage":"30","endPage":"45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34571","publicationTitle":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Magazine","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum sharing radios","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum sharing radios","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1648988/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 July 2006","volume":"6","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1648988/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"8949242","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum sharing radios","sourcePdf":"01648988.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052525S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"7384","isNumber":"34571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7384","citationCount":"156","xplore-issue":"34571","articleId":"1648988","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1649008,"authors":[{"name":"S.R.

Muller et al., 2005) which uses only a single active receiving antenna and multiple passive elements to achieve spatial diversity. The passive elements are used to construct suitable antenna patterns which can be rotated 360 degrees around to achieve a MIMO effect. This paper discusses some antenna patterns which can be used for this purpose. An example of an antenna with one active dipole and 6 passive dipoles distributed on a circle around it is given. The distance between the active dipole and the passive elements is chosen to be lambda/8, which means that the antenna system will have a diameter of approximately lambda/4. Further the broadband properties of this antenna system is considered in terms of mutual information for different frequencies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1649069/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9087986","publicationDate":"2006","conferenceDate":"22-24 Feb. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1649069/","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Appropriate Antenna Patterns For A Compact MIMO Receiver","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Appropriate Antenna Patterns For A Compact MIMO Receiver","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"01649069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045921S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"10970","isNumber":"34575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10970","xplore-issue":"34575","articleId":"1649069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1649072,"authors":[{"name":"R.F.H.

One key application of this is the transmission of possibly correlated symbol streams jointly by several multiple-antenna access points toward multiple single antenna user terminals located in neighboring cells. To augment the realism of this setting, we consider different levels of channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). In one case, we further introduce a constraint on hybrid channel state information (HCSI) in which any given transmitter knows its own CSI perfectly while it only has statistical information about other transmitters' channels. This yield a game situation in which each cooperating transmitter makes a guess about the behavior of the other transmitter. We show different transmission strategies under this setting and compare them with fully cooperative (full CSI) and non cooperative schemes.

Both algorithms track a number of the dominant eigenmodes of a fading MIMO channel. The first algorithm applies unitary transformations incrementally, while the second runs a stochastic search over the space of angles that parameterize a set of orthonormal complex vectors. The eigenmode estimate updates rely on a single feedback bit and ensure orthonormality at every instant without enforcing the condition explicitly. We introduce a cost function that minimizes both the channel induced symbol stream coupling at the receiver and the noise coloring effects of the channel equalizer. We show that our choice of cost function improves the performance when using a suboptimal linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) receiver.

The raw data for determining the tag positions stems from time-of-arrival (ToA) measurements of radio frequency (RF) pulses transmitted in between the tags. The sensor network is expected to operate indoors, i.e., the wireless channel is characterized by heavy multi-path propagation. It turns out that the probability density function (PDF) of the TOA measurement error has heavy tails due to this multi-path environment, which has a tremendous impact on the performance of the tag position calculation. We propose a novel position calculation algorithm, which utilizes the tails in the measurement error PDF and easy to implement. This is in contrast to existing approaches, which assume that the measurement error PDF is Gaussian. The novel positioning algorithm allows distributing the required calculations onto the tags and fusing TOA measurements from a large number of tags.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Zurich Seminar on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/10970/34575/01649116.pdf","startPage":"206","endPage":"209","publicationTitle":"2006 International Zurich Seminar on Communications","doi":"10.1109/IZS.2006.1649116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IZS.2006.1649116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34575","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1649116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved algorithm for UWB-bases positioning in a multi-path environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Measurement errors","Position measurement","Pulse measurements","Radio frequency","Algorithm design and analysis","Distributed algorithms","Ad hoc networks","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","probability","time-of-arrival estimation","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UWB-based positioning","multipath environment","wireless ad-hoc network","time-of-arrival","ToA","radio frequency pulses","multipath propagation","probability density function","tag position calculation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1649116/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Feb. 2006","displayDocTitle":"An improved algorithm for UWB-bases positioning in a multi-path environment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1649116/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9088032","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","conferenceDate":"22-24 Feb. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved algorithm for UWB-bases positioning in a multi-path environment","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"01649116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067698S","chronDate":"22-24 Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10970","isNumber":"34575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10970","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"34575","articleId":"1649116","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1649119,"authors":[{"name":"P.-A.

From the perspective of system-level wireless emulation, average link SNR is the dominant factor in the performance of a wireless link. Thus, this work seeks to develop a systematic link SNR mapping method that replicates real-world link SNRs on an indoor testbed. The challenge is to optimize the nodes' spatial configuration and transmission powers to overcome the inherent propagation differences, as expressed in terms of pathloss exponents and environmental shadowing, between the real world and a given testbed. To avoid the technical difficulty of \"forward mapping\" from the real world to the testbed, we have developed a reverse mapping method to turn a testbed configuration with given link SNRs into a corresponding real-world configuration. By inducing the dB link gain differences between the testbed and the real world distance-dependent path loss to have a Gaussian distribution, a close approximation to real-world log-normal shadow fading is achieved. We present results for a variety of indoor and outdoor real-world scenarios","doi":"10.1109/TRIDNT.2006.1649173","publicationTitle":"2nd International Conference on Testbeds and Research Infrastructures for the Development of Networks and Communities, 2006.

Rather, the focus will be on the other two potential benefits: more specifically, on the judicious use of number systems employing redundancy in representation. A positional number system with fixed radix, r, is redundant if the allowable digit set includes more than r distinct elements, thereby affording alternate representations of a given numeric value.

This faulty behavior can be modeled by two types of dynamic faults called un-restored write faults (URWFs) and un-restored read faults (URRFs). For this type of faults, we next propose a new test algorithm called March Pre. The main advantage of March Pre is its complexity, which is twice lower (2.5N) than that of the reference MATS+ algorithm (5N). On the other side, an obvious shortcoming is that it targets only faults in pre-charge circuits.

In this paper, we propose two novel iterative cyclicity restoration (CR) schemes to efficiently cancel these interferences for OFDM-based wireless local area network (WLAN) systems. The time-domain parallel CR (PCR) scheme is introduced first. Using time-domain iterative solution, PCR provides much lower computational complexity than conventional CR. Furthermore, in order to improve the performance of PCR, we present successive CR (SCR) method based on Gauss-Seidel iteration. SCR offers faster convergence speed than PCR without increasing the computational cost. It is shown that both PCR and SCR need only a few iterations to approach the system performance with sufficient CP. SCR has approximately the same performance as conventional CR with much lower computational complexity for WLAN applications.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2006.1649645","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/34592/01649645.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2006.1649645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34592","startPage":"321","endPage":"326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient time-domain residual ISI cancellation for OFDM-based WLAN systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1649645","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient time-domain residual ISI cancellation for OFDM-based WLAN systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1649645/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 July 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8982635","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1649645/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient time-domain residual ISI cancellation for OFDM-based WLAN systems","sourcePdf":"01649645.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049451S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"34592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"34592","articleId":"1649645","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1649669,"authors":[{"name":"Heeseung Jo","affiliation":["Computer Science Division, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/34592/1649669/1649669-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Heeseung Jo received the BS degree in computer science from Sogang University, Korea, in 2000, and the MS degree in computer science from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Korea, in 2006.

Though flash memory has various advantages over magnetic disks such as small and lightweight form factor, solid-state reliability, low power consumption, and shock resistance, its physical characteristics imposes several limitations. Most notably, it takes relatively long time to write data in flash memory and the data cannot be overwritten before being erased first. Since an erase operation is performed as a unit of larger block, the employed strategy for mapping logical blocks onto physical pages affects real performance of flash memory. This article suggests a flash-aware buffer management scheme that reduces the number of erase operations by selecting a victim based on its page utilization rather than based on the traditional LRU policy. Our scheme effectively minimizes the number of write and erase operations in flash memory, reducing the total execution time by 17% compared to the LRU policy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1649669/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 July 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","volume":"52","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8990822","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","publicationDate":"May 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1649669/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"FAB: flash-aware buffer management policy for portable media players","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FAB: flash-aware buffer management policy for portable media players","sourcePdf":"01649669.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070351S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"34592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"165","xplore-issue":"34592","articleId":"1649669","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1649674,"authors":[{"name":"Wenbin Luo","affiliation":["Engineering Department, Saint Mary''s University, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/34592/1649674/1649674-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wenbin Luo Wenbin Luo (S'99-M'03) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronics engineering from Fudan University, Shanghai, P.R.China, in 1996 and 1999, respectively, and the M.S. degree in statistics and Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, U.S.A., in 2002 and 2003, respectively.

In the algorithm, the rotation-invariant-features based circular block matching is proposed for the first time to estimate the local true motion vectors for the centers of all considered circular blocks. With these local motion vectors and their corresponding block positions, a linear system is constructed and solved by repeated least-squares to generate the global motion parameters (GMP) which are then refined by a gradient descent based iteration scheme. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DIS technique can generate more precise GMP and deal with larger motions compared with the ever presented optical flow based digital image stabilization technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital image stabilization based on circular block matching","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2006.1649681","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/34592/01649681.pdf","startPage":"566","endPage":"574","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2006.1649681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34592","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1649681","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1649681/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 July 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Digital image stabilization based on circular block matching","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"52","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1649681/","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2006","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"8990834","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital image stabilization based on circular block matching","sourcePdf":"01649681.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089686S","chronDate":"May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"34592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"34592","articleId":"1649681","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1649699,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Sheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/34592/1649699/1649699-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bin Sheng is a Ph.

Two of the major benefits of the LLC resonant topology are the ability of the power MOSFETs and secondary rectifiers to be soft-switched and the capability of operating down to zero load.

Self tuning controller can change gains of the controller according to system conditions. The gains are composed of the weights of RNN. For the on-line estimation of the weights of RNN, extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm should be used. In order to design EKF with optimal constants, simple genetic algorithm is proposed. Genetic algorithm can follow the optimal estimation constants without trial and error efforts.
