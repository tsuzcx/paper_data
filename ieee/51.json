The modal characteristic impedances, network functions, and multiconductor transmission lines stamp of pulse propagation in interconnects are derived. For signals with subnanosecond rise times, the interconnects always behave as transmission lines. Multichip module MCMs are the emerging technology for an advanced electronic packaging. This technology has the advantages of smaller size, lighter systems, and improved performance. The interconnect circuit parameters vary with frequency. Two- or three-dimensional finite elements, are used to solve the fields in terms of the magnetic vector potential and scalar potential. The loss analysis has taken into account the skin effect, proximity effect, and lossy dielectric material in the problem. The accuracy of the method is studied by comparison with available data in the literature.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of SOUTHEASTCON '96","pdfPath":"/iel3/3684/10833/00510045.pdf","startPage":"144","endPage":"147","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of SOUTHEASTCON '96","doi":"10.1109/SECON.1996.510045","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.1996.510045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10833","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=510045","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of lossy multi-chip module interconnections using finite element method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit interconnections","Multiconductor transmission lines","Dielectric losses","Electromagnetic modeling","Impedance","Transfer functions","Electromagnetic propagation","Optical propagation","Distributed parameter circuits","Multichip modules"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["skin effect","integrated circuit packaging","integrated circuit interconnections","finite element analysis","transmission line matrix methods","electric impedance","microstrip lines","electromagnetic fields","losses","multichip modules","integrated circuit modelling","linear network analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lossy multi-chip module interconnections","finite element method","electromagnetic modeling tool","networking distributed transmission line parameters","modal characteristic impedances","network functions","multiconductor transmission lines","pulse propagation","subnanosecond rise times","transmission lines","electronic packaging","interconnect circuit parameters","two-dimensional finite elements","three-dimensional finite elements","magnetic vector potential","scalar potential","loss analysis","skin effect","proximity effect","lossy dielectric material"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/510045/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Apr 1996","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of lossy multi-chip module interconnections using finite element method","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5375568","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of lossy multi-chip module interconnections using finite element method","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00510045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034346S","chronDate":"11-14 Apr 1996","isNumber":"10833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3684","articleId":"510045","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":510057,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Marra","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Marra","id":"37329265500"},{"name":"B.E.

The system was designed, implemented, trained and tested and was found to exhibit an accuracy of 93% on noisy characters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Apr 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/510102/","accessionNumber":"5380520","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multi-lingual character recognition using artificial neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-lingual character recognition using artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00510102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042079S","chronDate":"11-14 Apr 1996","isNumber":"10833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3684","articleId":"510102","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":510117,"authors":[{"name":"Hu Saigui","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Hu Saigui","id":"37354172000"},{"name":"Zou Yong","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zou Yong","id":"37358087300"},{"name":"Hu Jiandong","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Hu Jiandong","id":"37344533600"},{"name":"Bao Liu","affiliation":["University of Technology, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Bao Liu","id":"37065252700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3088-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"510117","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Code division multiplexing","Chaotic communication","Chaos","Lattices","Multiaccess communication","Transmitters","Spread spectrum communication","Quantization","Encoding","Error probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","code division multiple access","chaos","probability","error statistics","coding errors","synchronisation","correlation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete coupled chaotic sequence","synchronous CDMA system","spread-spectrum CDMA system","open flow coupled-chaotic sequence","signature sequence","coupled map lattices","long chaotic transient","crosscorrelation properties","autocorrelation properties","Gold sequence","m sequences","error probabilities"]}],"abstract":"A synchronous chaotic spread-spectrum CDMA system is presented.

The DAC is intended for applications using direct digital synthesis, and focus has been set on achieving a high spurious free dynamic range (SFDR). The main part of the DAC is a matrix of current cells. To reduce skew between the steering signals to the current cells, an emitter-coupled logic (ECL) flip-flop, clocked by a global ECL clock, is included in each current cell. A bipolar differential pair, steered by the differential output of the ECL flip-flop, is used in each current cell to steer the current. At a generated frequency of f/sub g//spl ap/0.3/spl middot/f/sub s/ (f/sub s/=100 MSamples/s), the simulated SFDR is larger than 60 dB. The DAC operates at 5 V, and has a power consumption of approximately 650 mW. The area of the chip-core is 2.2 mm/spl times/2.2 mm. Furthermore a measure to estimate the SFDR for the DAC based on short term simulations is presented. This measure seems to correspond very well with SFDR for long term simulations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["BiCMOS integrated circuits","Flip-flops","Clocks","Semiconductor device measurement","Process design","Signal synthesis","Dynamic range","Matrix converters","Logic","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS integrated circuits","digital-analogue conversion","integrated circuit layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS D/A converter","current-steering DAC","direct digital synthesis","spurious free dynamic range","emitter-coupled logic","ECL flip-flop","global ECL clock","bipolar differential pair","10 bit","0.8 micron","5 V","650 mW"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.1995.510193","publicationTitle":"38th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems.

To demonstrate the idea, a new MOS-type input stage has been designed with a 2-/spl mu/m CMOS process and simulation results of input stage transconductance are provided.

Because it is difficult for the patient to stay still during the data acquisition, head motion during scans are a source of image degradation. To reduce the degradation, a simple data acquisition technique is described. This technique associates the incoming data with the real-space position of the head. It consists of constantly monitoring the head position during PET studies and comparing the head position to the initial head position associated with the current acquisition frame. Every time the maximum RMS displacement within the field of view (FOV) is larger than a specified threshold value, the data acquisition system starts acquiring the data into a new frame. A complete study is then acquired over several frames. The number of frames required depends on the motion of the head during the study and on the threshold value. At the end of the study all the acquired frames are reconstructed independently and each image is rotated and translated according to its associated initial head position. When these images are added together, it will produce a final image with fewer motion artefacts.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.1995.510427","publicationTitle":"1995 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging Conference Record","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel3/3786/11046/00510427.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.1995.510427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11046","startPage":"963","endPage":"967 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion correction of PET images using multiple acquisition frames","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=510427","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Motion correction of PET images using multiple acquisition frames","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-28 Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/510427/","conferenceDate":"21-28 Oct. 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5352821","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion correction of PET images using multiple acquisition frames","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00510427.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028375S","chronDate":"21-28 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3786","citationCount":"1","articleId":"510427","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":510440,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Recent advancements in 3-D PET transmission measurements have been demonstrated using a point source and collecting single photon gamma radiation. Greater than an order of magnitude increase in counting statistics for 3-D acquisitions is possible over traditional dual photon techniques such as rotating rods. Usable single photon transmission scans as short as 2 minutes are practical. Such short scans will have reduced noise due to counting rates in excess of 2.5 M events/sec. Acquiring single photon transmission data in full ring 3-D PET requires several architectural additions to the tomograph. Additions include: 1) a \"place holding\" mode for the coincidence processor, 2) real-time single photon line of response rebinning electronics, 3) a liquid drive for moving a 4 mCi /sup 137/Cs point source at 1 metre/sec around the field of view, and 4) a fiber-optic detector system for tracking the point source position and speed. Initial implementation of these changes supports a first-of-its-kind 82 cm diameter, 23 cm axial length high resolution full ring 3-D PET tomograph.","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel3/3786/11046/00510440.pdf","startPage":"1026","endPage":"1030 vol.2","publicationTitle":"1995 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging Conference Record","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.1995.510440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.1995.510440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11046","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=510440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The architectural impact of single photon transmission measurements on full ring 3-D positron tomography","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Positron emission tomography","Noise reduction","Attenuation measurement","Noise measurement","Time measurement","Gamma rays","Statistics","Single photon emission computed tomography","Real time systems","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["positron emission tomography","biomedical equipment","biomedical measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single photon transmission measurements","full ring 3D positron tomography","scan time","measured attenuation correction","single photon gamma radiation","counting statistics","dual photon techniques","rotating rods","nuclear medicine","medical diagnostic imaging","medical instrumentation","equipment architecture","liquid drive","/sup 137/Cs point source","4E-3 ci","2 min","82 cm","23 cm","Cs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/510440/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-28 Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"The architectural impact of single photon transmission measurements on full ring 3-D positron tomography","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5352834","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-28 Oct. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The architectural impact of single photon transmission measurements on full ring 3-D positron tomography","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00510440.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051816S","chronDate":"21-28 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3786","citationCount":"9","articleId":"510440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":510469,"authors":[{"name":"H.

A preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) iterative algorithm for weighted least squares reconstruction (WLS) is formulated for emission tomography. A linear regularization method is adopted and shown to be equivalent to penalized WLS reconstruction with quadratic penalty functions. Using simulated positron emission tomography (PET) data of the Hoffman brain phantom, it was shown that the convergence rate of the PCG using the new preconditioner is an order-of-magnitude faster compared to the standard conjugate gradient algorithm. It is also significantly faster than previously proposed preconditioners for emission tomography.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Positron emission tomography","Equations","Image reconstruction","Vectors","Computational efficiency","Iterative algorithms","Biomedical imaging","Acceleration","Convergence","Image converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["positron emission tomography","algorithm theory","least mean squares methods","image reconstruction","medical image processing","brain","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm","iterative reconstruction convergence rate","quadratic penalty functions","Hoffman brain phantom","nuclear medicine","medical diagnostic imaging","weighted least squares reconstruction","preconditioners","PET"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11046","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.1995.510496","startPage":"1297","endPage":"1301 vol.2","publicationTitle":"1995 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging Conference Record","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel3/3786/11046/00510496.pdf","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.1995.510496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm for regularized WLS reconstruction for PET","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A fast preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm for regularized WLS reconstruction for PET","accessionNumber":"5358578","publicationDate":"1995","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"21-28 Oct. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/510496/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-28 Oct 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm for regularized WLS reconstruction for PET","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00510496.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051039S","chronDate":"21-28 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3786","citationCount":"1","articleId":"510496","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":510505,"authors":[{"name":"H.T.

This paper examines the flexibility of the interconnect structure that joins memory and logic. For architectures with only a few memory arrays, we find that both the routability and the delay of circuits are insensitive to the memory/logic interconnect flexibility, which implies that this interconnection can be made very inflexible. This is in contrast to the logic connection block flexibility, which has been shown to require high flexibility. For architectures with more arrays, the memory/logic interconnect flexibility requirements increase and approach those of logic interconnect.","doi":"10.1109/CICC.1996.510530","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/3769/11004/00510530.pdf","startPage":"144","endPage":"147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.1996.510530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11004","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=510530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memory/logic interconnect flexibility in FPGAs with large embedded memory arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 May 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/510530/","displayDocTitle":"Memory/logic interconnect flexibility in FPGAs with large embedded memory arrays","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-8 May 1996","accessionNumber":"5398453","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memory/logic interconnect flexibility in FPGAs with large embedded memory arrays","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00510530.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040044S","chronDate":"5-8 May 1996","isNumber":"11004","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3769","citationCount":"5","articleId":"510530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":510531,"authors":[{"name":"D.L.

For a given set of circuit specifications, several valid routing solutions can be found. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that selects the solution that additionally maximizes the yield and the testability of the resulting layout. Initially, the circuit is routed with a cost function designed to enforce all performance constraints. After all nets have been routed, the layout parasitics are extracted and the performance of the circuit is verified. In a second phase, nets are ripped up and rerouted to optimize the yield and the testability of the layout. During this process, care is taken not to introduce performance constraint violations. An industrial example, is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/510537/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 May 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5398460","conferenceDate":"5-8 May 1996","displayDocTitle":"Analog routing for manufacturability","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog routing for manufacturability","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00510537.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04636S","chronDate":"5-8 May 1996","isNumber":"11004","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3769","citationCount":"11","articleId":"510537","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":510539,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

Design experience and research in the early 1990s has amply demonstrated that doing so requires a \"power conscious\" design methodology that addresses dissipation at every level of the design hierarchy. Evidently, this cannot be achieved if no accompanying design automation environment is available. Spurred by this observation, we have seen an intensive effort in the domain of design automation for low power in recent years that has resulted in both academic and industrial tool environments. In this tutorial, we only focus on the analysis facet of the low power design process. Not only is the availability of analysis, simulation, and prediction tools the \"conditio sine qua non\" for low power design, it also represents the most understood and established component of the low-power design methodology. The paper starts with a discussion of power analysis at the circuit and logic design abstraction levels. This domain is becoming relatively mature with multiple entries commercially available. In our opinion, it is the high-level power prediction however that will have the most impact on the reduction of power dissipation. We have therefore included an in-depth discussion on the efforts and results in the so-called \"power exploration\" domain, that includes power prediction and analysis at the RTL level and above.","doi":"10.1109/CICC.1996.510546","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/3769/11004/00510546.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.1996.510546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11004","startPage":"215","endPage":"220","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring the power dimension [in digital CMOS]","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=510546","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Exploring the power dimension [in digital CMOS]","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 May 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/510546/","conferenceDate":"5-8 May 1996","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5411324","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring the power dimension [in digital CMOS]","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00510546.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066318S","chronDate":"5-8 May 1996","isNumber":"11004","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3769","citationCount":"12","articleId":"510546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":510551,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Such simulators however, are too slow to be of any use inside an iterative automatic timing driven layout (ATDL) engine, which may repeat the computations millions of times. Other methods such as half-perimeter approximation are very easy and fast to compute, but accuracy is very poor for these kinds of FPGAs. The method published by Chew and Lien [1994] overcomes these problems; however, it introduces a very large number of fitted parameters, and its accuracy decreases for more complicated topologies. We present a method similar to Chew and Lien's, but with better accuracy and far fewer coefficients. This is achieved by taking advantage of the symmetry of the problem under the permutation group S/sub N/ of N objects.","doi":"10.1109/CICC.1996.510571","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/3769/11004/00510571.pdf","startPage":"341","endPage":"344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.1996.510571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11004","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=510571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast and accurate delay estimation for use in timing driven layout for FPGAs with segmented channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 May 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/510571/","displayDocTitle":"Fast and accurate delay estimation for use in timing driven layout for FPGAs with segmented channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-8 May 1996","accessionNumber":"5411353","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and accurate delay estimation for use in timing driven layout for FPGAs with segmented channels","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00510571.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028304S","chronDate":"5-8 May 1996","isNumber":"11004","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3769","articleId":"510571","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":510576,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Overall DRAM test time can be reduced by 2/3 since this amount of time is being utilized to perform the data retention test.","doi":"10.1109/CICC.1996.510602","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.1996.510602","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/3769/11004/00510602.pdf","startPage":"483","endPage":"486","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11004","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Over an order of magnitude DRAM test time reduction by charge offset","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/510602/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 May 1996","displayDocTitle":"Over an order of magnitude DRAM test time reduction by charge offset","conferenceDate":"5-8 May 1996","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5411384","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Over an order of magnitude DRAM test time reduction by charge offset","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00510602.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.020794S","chronDate":"5-8 May 1996","isNumber":"11004","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3769","citationCount":"2","articleId":"510602","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":510609,"authors":[{"name":"P.C.H.

Due to the large latency inherent in multiplication, schemes have been devised to minimize the delay. Two methods are common in current implementations: regular arrays and Wallace trees. Previous gate-level analyses have suggested that not only are Wallace trees faster than array schemes, they also consume much less power. However these analyses did not take wiring into account, resulting in optimistic timing and power estimates. We develop a simplified comparative layout methodology to analyze the effect of physical layout on these designs. Results for short bit-width (8, 16, 24 bit) DSP multipliers show that while wiring has a major impact on signal delay and power, Wallace trees still show roughly a 10% power advantage over array-based designs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring multiplier architecture and layout for low power","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","doi":"10.1109/CICC.1996.510609","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/3769/11004/00510609.pdf","startPage":"513","endPage":"516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.1996.510609","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11004","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=510609","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/510609/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 May 1996","displayDocTitle":"Exploring multiplier architecture and layout for low power","conferenceDate":"5-8 May 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5411391","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring multiplier architecture and layout for low power","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00510609.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041851S","chronDate":"5-8 May 1996","isNumber":"11004","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3769","citationCount":"36","articleId":"510609","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":510610,"authors":[{"name":"B.

High time-bandwidth waveforms and coherent matched filtering are often used to improve detection performance in reverberation. However, an active sonar echo undergoes distortion during the two-way propagation and reflection from the target. As a result, the full performance gain is not achievable, and this approach is severely limited. In this case, more robust detectors are needed. We evaluate the detection performance of several commonly used detectors in an ideal nondistorting channel, a fast-fading distortion (FFD) channel, and a channel with time-spreading distortion (TSD). We examine the robustness of the various detectors by evaluating the performance in the case of mismatch between the detector and the channel parameters. Studying the relation between the FFD model and the TSD, we show that, under certain conditions, the TSD and FFD channels have an equivalent effect on the waveform.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.510610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11014","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/11014/00510610.pdf","endPage":"1622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of broadband signals in frequency and time dispersive channels","doi":"10.1109/78.510610","startPage":"1613","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=510610","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1996","displayDocTitle":"Detection of broadband signals in frequency and time dispersive channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/510610/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5321770","publicationDate":"July 1996","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"44","issue":"7","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of broadband signals in frequency and time dispersive channels","sourcePdf":"00510610.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039496S","chronDate":"Jul 1996","isNumber":"11014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"16","articleId":"510610","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":510611,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The multiresolution algorithm is used to decompose the received sampling sequence into a number of components, and then, an adaptive algorithm is applied to cancel the echo in the received signal. In this paper, the performance of this method is discussed, from which optimal conditions for echo cancellation are established for the design of wavelet packet multiresolution decomposition. An efficient algorithm for designing such a set of optimal discrete filter banks is developed. The cases of optimal in-band and adjacent-band adaptive filtering are examined. Experimental results showed that the use of optimally designed multiresolution filter banks coupled with in-band or adjacent-band adaptive filtering is much more effective than the employment of commonly used wavelet filter banks. Furthermore, the use of the adjacent-band adaptive filtering algorithm has superior performance compared with that of the in-band filtering.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/510615/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"44","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5321775","displayDocTitle":"Optimum filter banks for signal decomposition and its application in adaptive echo cancellation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum filter banks for signal decomposition and its application in adaptive echo cancellation","sourcePdf":"00510615.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053393S","chronDate":"Jul 1996","isNumber":"11014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"22","articleId":"510615","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":510616,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The popularity of these criteria partly stems from the intrinsically simple means by which they can be implemented. They can, however, produce misleading results if they are not carefully used. The AIC and MDL have a common form in that they comprise two terms, a data term and a penalty term. The data term quantifies the residuals of the model, and the penalty term reflects the desideratum of parsimony. While the data terms of the AIC and MDL are identical, the penalty terms are different. In most of the literature, the AIC and MDL penalties are, however, both obtained by apportioning an equal weight to each additional unknown parameter, be it phase, amplitude, or frequency. By contrast, we demonstrate that the penalties associated with the amplitude and phase parameters should be weighted differently than the penalty attached to the frequencies. Following the Bayesian methodology, we derive a model selection criterion for sinusoidal signals in Gaussian noise which also contains the log-likelihood and the penalty terms. The simulation results disclose remarkable improvement in our selection rule over the commonly used MDL and AIC.","doi":"10.1109/78.510621","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/11014/00510621.pdf","startPage":"1744","endPage":"1751","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.510621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11014","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A model selection rule for sinusoids in white Gaussian noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=510621","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/510621/","displayDocTitle":"A model selection rule for sinusoids in white Gaussian noise","volume":"44","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1996","accessionNumber":"5321780","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model selection rule for sinusoids in white Gaussian noise","sourcePdf":"00510621.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053612S","chronDate":"Jul 1996","isNumber":"11014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"118","articleId":"510621","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":510624,"authors":[{"name":"C.D.

The performance measures include the exact probability density functions (PDFs), confidence regions, and moments of the weight vector (matrix), beam response, and beamformer output of certain SCM-based (SCB) array processors. The array processors considered include the SCB: (i) maximum-likelihood (ML) signal vector estimator, (ii) linearly constrained minimum variance beamformer (LCMV), (iii) minimum variance distortionless response beamformer (MVDR), and (iv) generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) implementation of the LCMV beamformer. It is shown that the exact joint PDFs for the weight vectors/matrices of the aforementioned SCB array processors are a linear transformation from a complex multivariate extension of the standardized t-distribution. The SCB beam responses are generalized t-distributed, and the PDFs of the SCB beamformer outputs are given by Kummer's function. All but the beamformer outputs are shown to be completely invariant statistics over the class of MECs considered.","doi":"10.1109/78.510624","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/11014/00510624.pdf","startPage":"1779","endPage":"1793","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.510624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11014","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PDF's, confidence regions, and relevant statistics for a class of sample covariance-based array processors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=510624","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/510624/","displayDocTitle":"PDF's, confidence regions, and relevant statistics for a class of sample covariance-based array processors","volume":"44","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1996","accessionNumber":"5321783","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PDF's, confidence regions, and relevant statistics for a class of sample covariance-based array processors","sourcePdf":"00510624.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054446S","chronDate":"Jul 1996","isNumber":"11014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"51","articleId":"510624","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":510629,"authors":[{"name":"J.K.

In the case of trained (nonblind) equalizers, the performance of FS equalizers is known to be independent of the timing-phase unlike that of baud-rate equalizers. Moreover, trained FS equalizers synthesize optimal filters in the minimum mean-square error sense, and hence are superior to baud-rate trained equalizers. It is an open question whether such properties hold true for FS Godard blind equalizers. We present a simulation example where such advantages do not materialize.

A recent US Air Force investment in STAP has produced a database of multichannel airborne data, through Rome Laboratory's Multichannel Airborne Radar Measurement (MCARM) program, to further develop STAP architectures and algorithms suited to operational environments. An aspect of actual data not typically incorporated into simulation scenarios is the nonhomogeneous features of real-world clutter and interference scenarios. In this paper we investigate the impact of nonhomogeneous data on the performance of STAP. Furthermore, we propose a preliminary scheme to detect and excise nonhomogeneous secondary data in the sample covariance estimation, thereby dramatically improving STAP performance as shown through a specific example using monostatic MCARM data.","doi":"10.1109/NRC.1996.510669","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00510669.png","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1996 IEEE National Radar Conference","startPage":"130","endPage":"135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NRC.1996.510669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10936","pdfPath":"/iel3/3738/10936/00510669.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1996 IEEE National Radar Conference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Airborne radar","Force measurement","System analysis and design","Doppler radar","Radar clutter","Spaceborne radar","Object detection","Jamming","Investments","Spatial databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airborne radar","radar signal processing","adaptive signal processing","radar target recognition","adaptive radar","radar clutter","jamming","covariance analysis","search radar","adaptive filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichannel airborne radar measurements","design","space-time processing architectures","algorithms","system design studies","radar simulations","space-time adaptive processing","target detection","target Doppler","sidelobe clutter","jamming","operational environments","interference","nonhomogeneous data","STAP performance","nonhomogeneous secondary data","sample covariance estimation","monostatic MCARM data"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Assessment of multichannel airborne radar measurements for analysis and design of space-time processing architectures and algorithms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/510669/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5391879","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","conferenceDate":"13-16 May 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 May 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assessment of multichannel airborne radar measurements for analysis and design of space-time processing architectures and algorithms","confLoc":"Ann Arbor, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00510669.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04259S","chronDate":"13-16 May 1996","isNumber":"10936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3738","citationCount":"67","articleId":"510669","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":510674,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It is well-known that the optimum strategy to detect a perfectly known signal embedded in correlated Gaussian clutter is given by comparing the whitening-matched filter output to a given threshold, which is predetermined according to the desired probability of false alarm. When the clutter is non-Gaussian the performance of the matched filter degrades, and the optimum detector in such a disturbance may be non-linear. For the non-Gaussian clutter model considered, the optimum detector is a function of two statistics: a linear statistic (the matched filter output) and a quadratic statistic. We show that the optimum detection strategy can be seen as the classical matched filter output compared to an adaptive threshold that depends on the data through the quadratic statistic. This interpretation has given us an insight into the structure of the optimum detector and has suggested an approach to obtain, analyze and compare suboptimum detectors that are easily implementable with a performance close to optimal.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum and sub-optimum coherent radar detection in compound Gaussian clutter: a data-dependent threshold interpretation","doi":"10.1109/NRC.1996.510674","endPage":"165","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1996 IEEE National Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/3738/10936/00510674.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1996 IEEE National Radar Conference","startPage":"160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NRC.1996.510674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10936","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=510674","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar detection","Gaussian processes","Detectors","Statistics","Radar clutter","Matched filters","Random variables","Backscatter","Multidimensional systems","Clouds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar detection","Gaussian processes","correlation methods","Gaussian distribution","matched filters","filtering theory","statistical analysis","optimisation","adaptive signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["suboptimum coherent radar detection","optimum coherent radar detection","compound Gaussian clutter","radar targets","K-distributed clutter","coherent clutter","whitening matched filter output","correlated Gaussian clutter","false alarm probability","nonGaussian clutter","linear statistic","quadratic statistic","adaptive threshold","data dependent threshold interpretation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimum and sub-optimum coherent radar detection in compound Gaussian clutter: a data-dependent threshold interpretation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/510674/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 May 1996","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","conferenceDate":"13-16 May 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5391884","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum and sub-optimum coherent radar detection in compound Gaussian clutter: a data-dependent threshold interpretation","confLoc":"Ann Arbor, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00510674.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03419S","chronDate":"13-16 May 1996","isNumber":"10936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3738","citationCount":"15","articleId":"510674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":510696,"authors":[{"name":"A.

FEMATS is a general-purpose code for computing the radar cross-section (RCS) of arbitrary three dimensional targets with material inhomogeneities. It employs state-of-the-art techniques in finite element modeling of open structures, the latest sparse matrix solutions and graphical user interface for pre- and post-processing of the geometry and data files. Although the code has been primarily used for finding the echo-area of targets, FEMATS can be easily extended to solve open domain problems related to antennas, microwave circuits and cellular phones. The power of FEMATS comes from two features inherent in the technique: (i) the ability to model complicated geometries in three dimensions having arbitrary material fillings without code modification; (ii) the O(N) memory requirement of the method due to the employed local mesh termination techniques conformal to the target. This feature essentially implies that the technique scales favorably with problem size and thus very large problems can be tackled with minimal usage of computer memory and time.","doi":"10.1109/NRC.1996.510704","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1996 IEEE National Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1996 IEEE National Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/3738/10936/00510704.pdf","startPage":"339","endPage":"344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NRC.1996.510704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10936","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FEMATS: a general-purpose scattering code using the finite element method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=510704","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 May 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/510704/","displayDocTitle":"FEMATS: a general-purpose scattering code using the finite element method","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5391914","conferenceDate":"13-16 May 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FEMATS: a general-purpose scattering code using the finite element method","confLoc":"Ann Arbor, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00510704.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100583S","chronDate":"13-16 May 1996","isNumber":"10936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3738","articleId":"510704","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":510710,"authors":[{"name":"W.D.

Observable effects of border traps include capacitance-voltage (C-V) hysteresis, enhanced 1/f noise, compensation of trapped holes, and increased thermally stimulated current in MOS capacitors. Effects of faster (switching times between /spl ap/10/sup -6/ s and /spl ap/1 s) and slower (switching times greater than /spl ap/1 s) border traps have been resolved via a dual-transistor technique. In conjunction with studies of MOS electrical response, electron paramagnetic resonance and spin dependent recombination studies suggest that E' defects (trivalent Si centers in SiO/sub 2/ associated with O vacancies) can function as border traps in MOS devices exposed to ionizing radiation or high-field stress. Hydrogen-related centers may also be border traps.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/510713/","volume":"43","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"5319569","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fast and slow border traps in MOS devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and slow border traps in MOS devices","sourcePdf":"00510713.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100258S","chronDate":"June  1996","isNumber":"10976","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"107","articleId":"510713","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":510724,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Using this model we are able to compute the gate delay efficiently, within 25% of SPICE-computed delays. Our parameters depend only on total interconnect tree resistance and capacitance at the output of the gate, Previous \"effective load capacitance\" methods, applicable only for distributed RC interconnects, are based on /spl Pi/ model parameters obtained via a recursive admittance moment computation.

In dynamic random-access memory devices (DRAM), the data are stored as the presence or absence of minority carrier charges on storage capacitors. For example, in n-channel MOS memory devices, the charge carriers are electrons and the capacitors are potential wells in the p-type silicon. Alpha particles emitted from trace levels of uranium and thorium in the packaging materials can penetrate the surface of the semiconductor die. As the alpha particle passes through the semiconductor device, electrons an dislodged from the crystal lattice sites along the track of the alpha particle. If the total number of generated electrons collected by an empty storage well exceeds the number of electrons that differentiates between a 1 and a 0, the collected electron charge can flip a 1 to a 0 generating a soft error in the memory device. The trend toward increased chip density, smaller device dimensions, and lower voltages further increases the susceptibility of DRAM to soft errors. The susceptibility of DRAM to soft errors is typically measured by accelerated tests or real-time SER tests, each of which have strengths and weaknesses. Knowledge of the factors which lead to soft errors can be used to improve reliability in DRAM by using a physics-of-failure approach to monitor variables in the manufacturing process resulting in building reliability into the manufacturing process.","doi":"10.1109/24.510798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11060","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/24.510798","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel1/24/11060/00510798.pdf","startPage":"174","endPage":"179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft errors induced by alpha particles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1996","displayDocTitle":"Soft errors induced by alpha particles","volume":"45","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1996","accessionNumber":"5338024","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/510798/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft errors induced by alpha particles","sourcePdf":"00510798.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049082S","chronDate":"Jun 1996","isNumber":"11060","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"48","articleId":"510798","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":510802,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Lee","affiliation":["Nan-Tai College, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jing Lee","id":"37350927300"},{"name":"Jung-Hua Chou","affiliation":["National Engineering Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jung-Hua Chou","id":"38665836700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9529"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1721"}],"articleNumber":"510802","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Reliability Society","url":"http://rs.ieee.org/publications.html"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuits","Clustering algorithms","Constraint optimization","Substrates","Wiring","Thermal stresses","Power system reliability","Temperature dependence","Delay","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power integrated circuits","hybrid integrated circuits","integrated circuit reliability","wiring","cooling","circuit optimisation","thermal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power hybrid circuit","wireability","reliability","hierarchical placement","hierarchical design","heat dissipation rate","maximum temperature","substrate","circuit reliability","wiring length","placement algorithm"]}],"abstract":"While a PHC (power hybrid circuit) laid out for optimizing reliability could be unroutable or extremely time consuming, a PHC laid out for optimizing wireability could have poor reliability.

The components with higher heat dissipation rate are evenly distributed to reduce both the maximum temperature and the maximum temperature variation on the substrate.

The problem is to select components and redundancy-levels to optimize some objective function, given system-level constraints on reliability, cost, and/or weight. Previous formulations of the problem have implicit restrictions concerning the type of redundancy allowed, the number of available component choices, and whether mixing of components is allowed. GA is a robust evolutionary optimization search technique with very few restrictions concerning the type or size of the design problem. The solution approach was to solve the dual of a nonlinear optimization problem by using a dynamic penalty function. GA performs very well on two types of problems: (1) redundancy allocation originally proposed by Fyffe, Hines, Lee, and (2) randomly generated problem with more complex k-out-of-n:G configurations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/510811/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1996","volume":"45","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2005","publicationDate":"June 1996","accessionNumber":"5338037","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Reliability optimization of series-parallel systems using a genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability optimization of series-parallel systems using a genetic algorithm","sourcePdf":"00510811.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04256S","chronDate":"Jun 1996","isNumber":"11060","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"541","articleId":"510811","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":510815,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

This paper presents a reconfiguration algorithm (QRCF) for memories that contain clustered faults. QRCF operates in a branch and bound fashion similar to known optimal algorithms that require exponential time. However, QRCF repairs faults in clusters rather than individually. Since many faults are repaired simultaneously, the execution-time of QRCF does not become prohibitive even for large memories containing many faults. The performance of QRCF is evaluated under a probabilistic model for clustered faults in a memory array. For a special case of the fault model, QRCF solves the reconfiguration problem exactly in polynomial time. In the general case, QRCF produces an optimal solution with high probability. The algorithm is also evaluated through simulation. The performance and execution-time of QRCF on arrays containing clustered faults are compared with other approximation algorithms and with an optimal algorithm. The simulation results show that QRCF outperforms previous approximation algorithms by a wide margin and performs nearly as well as the optimal algorithm with an execution-time that is orders of magnitude less.","doi":"10.1109/24.510815","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel1/24/11060/00510815.pdf","startPage":"274","endPage":"284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/24.510815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11060","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of a reconfiguration-algorithm for memory arrays containing clustered faults","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=510815","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/510815/","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of a reconfiguration-algorithm for memory arrays containing clustered faults","volume":"45","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1996","accessionNumber":"5338041","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of a reconfiguration-algorithm for memory arrays containing clustered faults","sourcePdf":"00510815.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068677S","chronDate":"Jun 1996","isNumber":"11060","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"25","articleId":"510815","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":510833,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This method is based on the newly introduced concept of a self-dual complement of a given Boolean function. The parity prediction function f/sub p/ of ordinary parity checking is replaced by the self-dual complement /spl delta//sub p/ of this function such that the module-2 sum of the outputs of the monitored circuit and of /spl delta//sub p/ is an arbitrary self-dual Boolean function h. Because of the large number of possible choices for h as an arbitrary self-dual Boolean function, the area overhead for an optimal self-dual complement /spl delta//sub p/ is small. Alternating inputs are applied to the circuit; the output h is alternating as long as no error occurs. The fault coverage of this method is almost the same as for parity checking. The usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated for MCNC benchmark circuits.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28 Apr-1 May 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/510852/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5391444","conferenceDate":"28 April-1 May 1996","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Self-dual parity checking-A new method for on-line testing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-dual parity checking-A new method for on-line testing","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00510852.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022651S","chronDate":"28 Apr-1 May 1996","isNumber":"10937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3739","citationCount":"17","articleId":"510852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":510857,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Moreover, two test sets, one compacted and one non-compacted, generated using the same test generation objectives, typically have similar defect coverages, even if the compacted one is significantly smaller than the uncompacted one.

A general approach which regards testing as can application for the reconfigurable FPGA, is then proposed. It is shown that different arrangements of disjoint one-dimensional arrays with unilateral horizontal connections and common vertical input lines provide a very good solution. A further feature that is considered for array testing, is the relation between the configuration of the logic blocks and the number of I/O pins in the chip.

During the test mode, the circuit under test (CUT) is converted to a circuit that oscillates. Faults in the CUT which cause a reasonable deviation of the oscillation frequency from its nominal value can be detected. Using this test method, no test vector is required to be applied. Therefore, the test vector generation problem is eliminated and the test time is very small because a limited number of oscillation frequencies is evaluated for each CUT. Due to its digital nature, the oscillation frequency can be easily interfaced to boundary scan. This characteristics imply that oscillation-test strategy is very attractive for wafer-probe testing as well as final production testing. In this paper, the validity of the proposed test method has been verified throughout some examples such as operational amplifiers and analog-to-digital converter (ADC).","doi":"10.1109/VTEST.1996.510896","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 14th VLSI Test Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 14th VLSI Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/3739/10937/00510896.pdf","startPage":"476","endPage":"482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTEST.1996.510896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10937","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Oscillation-test strategy for analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/510896/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28 Apr-1 May 1996","displayDocTitle":"Oscillation-test strategy for analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5391488","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 April-1 May 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oscillation-test strategy for analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00510896.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049263S","chronDate":"28 Apr-1 May 1996","isNumber":"10937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3739","citationCount":"98","articleId":"510896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":510898,"authors":[{"name":"Chen-Yang Pan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, USA"],"lastName":"Chen-Yang Pan","id":"37087180090"},{"name":"Kwang-Ting Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, USA"],"lastName":"Kwang-Ting Cheng","id":"37087149426"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7304-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-0167"}],"articleNumber":"510898","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":77},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit testing","Analog circuits","Impulse testing","Yield estimation","Circuit faults","White noise","Random variables","Delay estimation","Very large scale integration","Active filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue integrated circuits","mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","integrated circuit testing","VLSI","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["implicit functional testing","analog circuits","linear time-invariant circuits","impulse response samples","pseudo-random technique","production testing time","fault coverage","yield coverages"]}],"abstract":"We propose an efficient approach to functional testing for linear time-invariant (LTI) analog circuits.

Our architecture addresses all-optical transport over the wide, metropolitan, and local areas. It utilizes wavelength partitioning, routing, and active multiwavelength cross-connect switches to achieve a network that is scaleable in the number of users, data rates, and geographic span. The network supports two services which can be point-to-multipoint or multipoint-to-multipoint simplex or duplex connections. The A service is a transparent physically circuit-switched service and the B-service is a scheduled time-slotted circuit which is transparent within its time slots.

The physical topology consists of the nodes and fiber links in the network. On an AON physical topology, we can set up lightpaths between pairs of nodes, where a lightpath represents a direct optical connection without any intermediate electronics. The set of lightpaths along with the nodes constitutes the logical topology. For a given network physical topology and traffic pattern, our objective is to design the logical topology and the routing algorithm so as to minimize the network congestion while constraining the average delay seen by a source-destination pair and the amount of processing required at the nodes (degree of the logical topology). Ignoring the delay constraints can result in fairly convoluted logical topologies with very long delays. On the other hand, in all our examples, imposing it results in a minimal increase in congestion. While the number of wavelengths required to imbed the resulting logical topology on the physical all optical topology is also a constraint in general, we find that in many cases of interest this number can be quite small. We formulate the combined logical topology design and routing problem described above as a mixed integer linear programming problem which we then solve for a number of cases of a six-node network. This programming problem is split into two subproblems: logical topology design, and routing. We then compare the performance of several heuristic topology design algorithms against that of randomly generated topologies, as well as lower bounds.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/510907/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1996","publicationDate":"June 1996","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5305029","volume":"14","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design of logical topologies for wavelength-routed optical networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of logical topologies for wavelength-routed optical networks","sourcePdf":"00510907.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089268S","chronDate":"Jun 1996","isNumber":"10916","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"406","articleId":"510907","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":510908,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The solution provided is based on finding optimal routes for lightpaths and the new concept of semilightpaths. A lightpath is a fully optical transmission path, while a semilightpath is a transmission path constructed by chaining together several lightpaths, using wavelength conversion at their junctions. A fast and practical algorithm is presented to optimally route lightpaths and semilightpaths taking into account both the cost of using the wavelengths on links and the cost of wavelength conversion. We prove that the running time of the algorithm is the best possible in the wide class of algorithms allowing linear algebraic operations on weights. This class encompasses all known related practical methods. Additionally, our method works for any physical realization of wavelength conversion, independently whether it is done via optoelectronic conversion or in a fully optical way.","doi":"10.1109/49.510914","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"909","endPage":"913","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/10916/00510914.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.510914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lightpath (wavelength) routing in large WDM networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelength routing","Intelligent networks","WDM networks","Optical wavelength conversion","Cost function","Optical fiber networks","Bandwidth","Wavelength division multiplexing","Telecommunication traffic","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication network routing","light transmission","circuit switching","wide area networks","optical fibre networks","wavelength division multiplexing","linear algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large WDM networks","lightpath routing","wavelength routing","circuit switching","wide area optical networks","optimal routes","semilightpaths","optical transmission path","wavelength conversion","lightpath junctions","practical algorithm","algorithm running time","linear algebraic operations","weights","optoelectronic conversion","optical conversion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1996","displayDocTitle":"Lightpath (wavelength) routing in large WDM networks","volume":"14","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5305036","publicationDate":"June 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/510914/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lightpath (wavelength) routing in large WDM networks","sourcePdf":"00510914.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047811S","chronDate":"Jun 1996","isNumber":"10916","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"225","articleId":"510914","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":510916,"authors":[{"name":"M.S.

A possible optical solution to resource contention is based on the use of switching matrices suitably connected with optical delay lines. Signalling could be dealt with using subcarrier multiplexing of packet headers. Synchronization could take advantage of clock tone multiplexing techniques, digital processing for ultra-fast clock recovery, and new distributed techniques for global packet-slot alignment. To explore the practical feasibility and effectiveness of these key techniques, a consortium was formed among the University of Massachusetts, Stanford University, and GTE Laboratories. The consortium, funded by ARPA, has three main goals: investigating networking issues involved in optical contention resolution (University of Massachusetts), constructing an experimental contention-resolution optical (CRO) device (GTE Laboratories), and building a packet-switched optical network prototype employing a CRO and novel signaling/synchronization techniques (Stanford University).

The fundamental element of the demonstration network is a 10 ps, wavelength tunable, low jitter, pulse source. Electrical data is encoded onto three optical pulse trains, and the resultant low duty cycle optical data channels are multiplexed together using 25 ps fiber delay lines. This gives an overall network capacity of 40 Gb/s. A nonlinear optical loop mirror (NOLM) is used to carry out the demultiplexing at the station receiver. The channel to be switched out can be selected by adjusting the phase of the electrical signal used to generate the control pulses for the NOLM. By using external injection into a gain-switched distributed feedback (DFB) laser we are able to obtain very low jitter control pulses of 4-ps duration (RMS jitter <1 ps) after compression of the highly chirped gain switched pulses in a normal dispersive fiber. This enables us to achieve excellent eye openings for the three demultiplexed channels. The difficulty in obtaining complete switching of the signal pulses is presented. This is shown to be due to the deformation of the control pulse in the NOLM (caused by the soliton effect compression).

A number of researchers have already demonstrated the feasibility of efficient scalable image and video compression. The principle focus of this paper is to describe data structures for highly scalable compressed video, which are able to support simple, generic scaling approaches for both constant bit rate and constant distortion scaling criteria. Interactive video material presents particular challenges when the data stream is to be scaled to maintain an approximately constant level of distortion, rather than just a constant bit rate. Special attention is paid, therefore, to the development of generic, robust scaling algorithms for such applications. The data structures and scaling methodologies developed are particularly appealing for the distribution of highly scalable compressed video over heterogeneous media, because they simultaneously support both variable bit rate (VBR) and constant bit rate (CBR) services with a wide range of available service qualities, using only simple, generic mechanisms for scaling. The performance of the proposed scaling methodologies is experimentally investigated using a highly scalable video compression algorithm, which is able to achieve comparable compression performance to that of the inherently nonscalable MPEG-1 compression standard.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A common framework for rate and distortion based scaling of highly scalable compressed video","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/76.510928","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/11135/00510928.pdf","startPage":"329","endPage":"354","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.510928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11135","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=510928","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/510928/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"A common framework for rate and distortion based scaling of highly scalable compressed video","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5350781","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A common framework for rate and distortion based scaling of highly scalable compressed video","sourcePdf":"00510928.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045868S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"38","articleId":"510928","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":510931,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Liang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chin-Liang Wang","id":"37068528500"},{"name":"Ker-Min Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ker-Min Chen","id":"37349547800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"510931","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Vector quantization","Image coding","Bandwidth","Decoding","Hardware","CMOS technology","Costs","Data compression","Pulse modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI","CMOS digital integrated circuits","vector quantisation","search problems","video coding","image coding","computational complexity","modules","digital signal processing chips","systolic arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full-search vector quantization","VLSI architecture","systolic architecture","encoder","2D systolic array","codebook size","codebook dimension","VQ encoder","area complexity","time complexity","I/O bandwidth","hardware cost","speed performance","regular architecture","modular architecture","VLSI technology","0.8 /spl mu/m CMOS technology","input data wordlength","die size","high-speed image/video applications","8 bit","0.8 micron"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=510931","abstract":"This paper presents a new systolic architecture that can be used to realize the full-search vector quantization (VQ) encoder for high-speed applications. The architecture possesses the features of regularity and modularity, and is thus very suitable for VLSI implementation. For a codebook of size N and dimension k, the VQ encoder has an area complexity of O(N), a time complexity of O(k), and I/O bandwidth of O(k). It reaches a compromise between the hardware cost and speed performance as compared to existing systolic/regular VQ encoders. At the current state of VLSI technology, the proposed system can easily be realized in a single chip for most practical applications. In addition, it provides flexibility in changing the codebook contents and extending the codebook size, where the latter is achieved simply by cascading some identical basic chips. With 0.8 /spl mu/m CMOS technology to implement the proposed VQ encoder for the case of N=256, K=16, and an input data wordlength of 8 bit, the chip requires a die size of about 5.5/spl times/8.9 mm/sup 2/ and is able for processing 6.25 M data vectors (or 100 M data samples) every second. These features show that the proposed architecture is attractive for use in high-speed image/video applications.","doi":"10.1109/76.510931","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/11135/00510931.pdf","startPage":"389","endPage":"398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.510931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new VLSI architecture for full-search vector quantization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/510931/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"A new VLSI architecture for full-search vector quantization","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5350784","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new VLSI architecture for full-search vector quantization","sourcePdf":"00510931.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093481S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"15","articleId":"510931","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":510936,"authors":[{"name":"Lurng-Kuo Liu","affiliation":["IBM, IBM Thomas J.

The role of the noise bandwidth is quantified. The effect of cochannel interference on the estimate is negligible.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1993.510946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11153","publicationTitle":"IEEE 43rd Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 43rd Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/3812/11153/00510946.pdf","endPage":"862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of maximum Doppler frequency for handoff decisions","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1993.510946","startPage":"859","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=510946","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of maximum Doppler frequency for handoff decisions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/510946/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4978730","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"18-20 May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of maximum Doppler frequency for handoff decisions","confLoc":"Secaucus, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00510946.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03049S","chronDate":"18-20 May 1993","isNumber":"11153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3812","citationCount":"86","articleId":"510946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":510966,"authors":[{"name":"O.J.

This absorbing boundary condition promises to be very attractive for microwave CAD applications involving complex geometries such as high-density microwave integrated circuits and electronic packages, because the computational domain can be significantly reduced. This paper presents, for the first time, a rigorous analysis of the stability of the PML boundary condition applied to finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation.

An optimum HBT device size and bias was determined which offers a device minimum NF (NF/sub min/) of 0.9 dB at 2 GHz. The resulting HBT LNA achieves minimum noise figures of 1.5 dB, 1.6 dB, and 2.1 dB at 1 GHz, 2 GHz, and 3 GHz, respectively, while consuming only 6 mA of DC current through a 5 V supply. These NF's are believed to be the lowest reported for Si-BJT or GaAs HBT-based LNA MMICs in this frequency range. In addition, the LNA also achieves a gain of 22.4 dB, a 3.5 GHz bandwidth, and an IP3 greater than 8 dBm at 2 GHz. The design optimization revealed here gives insight into the noise performance trade-offs associated with GaAs HBT-based MMIC LNAs for low DC power wireless applications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium arsenide","Heterojunction bipolar transistors","Low-noise amplifiers","MMICs","Noise figure","Noise measurement","Optimized production technology","Frequency","Gain","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium arsenide","III-V semiconductors","heterojunction bipolar transistors","DC amplifiers","MMIC amplifiers","integrated circuit noise","bipolar MMIC","microwave amplifiers","circuit optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HBT direct-coupled LNA","DC low noise amplifier","MMIC LNA","noise figure optimisation","gamma optimum characteristics","optimum HBT device size","optimum HBT bias","low DC power wireless applications","1 to 6 GHz","1.5 to 2.1 dB","6 mA","5 V","22.4 dB","3.5 GHz","GaAs"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1996.511062","publicationTitle":"1996 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel3/3773/11021/00511062.pdf","startPage":"815","endPage":"818 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11021","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1996.511062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise optimization of a GaAs HBT direct-coupled low noise amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=511062","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Noise optimization of a GaAs HBT direct-coupled low noise amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/511062/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5342258","conferenceDate":"17-21 June 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-21 June 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise optimization of a GaAs HBT direct-coupled low noise amplifier","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00511062.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097061S","chronDate":"17-21 June 1996","isNumber":"11021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3773","citationCount":"4","articleId":"511062","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":511063,"authors":[{"name":"M.

An extensive large signal HB analysis, based on \"the substitute generator technique\", was achieved to optimize the load impedance at harmonic frequencies required for class F operation. Furthermore, the performances of the transistor in terms of added power, power added efficiency and dissipated power, were investigated under different bias modes (i.e.: constant base voltage, constant base current and self bias modes).

The results confirm that an important criterion was determined for the design of an effective shield for large chambers.","doi":"10.1109/20.511407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.511407","endPage":"2608","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/11092/00511407.pdf","startPage":"2605","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Magnetic shielding effects by the superposition of a six-layered ferromagnetic cylinder over a BPSCCO cylinder","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/511407/","displayDocTitle":"Magnetic shielding effects by the superposition of a six-layered ferromagnetic cylinder over a BPSCCO cylinder","volume":"32","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"5349627","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1996","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Magnetic shielding effects by the superposition of a six-layered ferromagnetic cylinder over a BPSCCO cylinder","sourcePdf":"00511407.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030992S","chronDate":"July  1996","isNumber":"11092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"5","articleId":"511407","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":511408,"authors":[{"name":"T.M.

The dispersion of nl as obtained from a Kramers-Kronig transformation of this absorption change scales as E/sub g//sup -1/. The agreement of this theory to data for semiconductors was excellent.

A small-signal analysis using the lumped element model shows that both the frequency and damping of the characteristic resonances of the coupled complex field and free carriers (gain medium) are modified. The detuning between the injected field and the free-running oscillating field, the amplitude of the injection field relative to the free-running field, the linewidth enhancement factor, the cavity photon and spontaneous carrier decay rates, and the field enhancement of the decay rate are all key parameters in determining the changes to the modulation characteristics. For a broad range of parameters, there is simultaneous enhancement of the modulation bandwidth and stable, locked operation. The enhancement is a cavity phenomena and does not occur in a traveling wave amplifier. It requires that the frequency of the locking field be detuned from the injection-modified frequency of the cavity resonance. This causes a resonant enhancement of the modulation sideband associated with the preferred frequency of the optical cavity. Bandwidth enhancements beyond the free-running laser limit are possible over a range of injection levels and injection frequency detunings.","doi":"10.1109/3.511559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.511559","endPage":"1468","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/11122/00511559.pdf","startPage":"1456","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Small-signal analysis of modulation characteristics in a semiconductor laser subject to strong optical injection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/511559/","displayDocTitle":"Small-signal analysis of modulation characteristics in a semiconductor laser subject to strong optical injection","volume":"32","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"5354864","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small-signal analysis of modulation characteristics in a semiconductor laser subject to strong optical injection","sourcePdf":"00511559.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041052S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11122","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"92","articleId":"511559","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":511569,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The algorithm is based on suitable techniques for solution encoding and evaluation function definition, effective cross-over and mutation operators, and heuristic operators which further improve the method's effectiveness.

Experimental results show that the proposed method is competitive with the most effective ones as far as the CPU time requirements and the result accuracy is considered, but it also presents some advantages. It requires a limited amount of memory, it is not sensible to special structures which are critical for other methods, and has a complexity which grows linearly with the number of implementations.

Several authors have recently shown that node clustering or compaction enhances the performance of iterative algorithms. This paper describes a technique to extract clusters by means of an algorithm that identifies a maximum weight matching in a path graph in linear time. The resulting linear placement algorithm (CLP) combines node compactions and iterative improvement in an efficient and effective approach. The benefit of compaction is quite visible. Comparisons of the results of CLP with and without compaction on several test cases show the dramatic effect of compaction on the final solution. The approach of CLP is an efficient improvement of the linear placement algorithm of Saab and Chen [1994]. On many instances with known optimal solutions, CLP also achieves an optimal solution. The dependency of the results of CLP on the initial placement is minimal, since solutions found by CLP using many different starts do not significantly differ from each other. Under suitable assumption, CLP can be shown to run in O(nP), where n and P are the number of nodes and the number of pins of the input circuit, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/43.511574","startPage":"952","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/11089/00511574.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.511574","endPage":"958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11089","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved linear placement algorithm using node compaction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/511574/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"An improved linear placement algorithm using node compaction","volume":"15","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5348496","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved linear placement algorithm using node compaction","sourcePdf":"00511574.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07115S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"4","articleId":"511574","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":511575,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The influence of saturation filtering on the bandwidth of the converters is explained and conditions for conversion at 20 Gb/s or more are identified. The cross gain modulation scheme shows extinction ratio degradation for conversion to longer wavelengths. This can be overcome using cross phase modulation in semiconductor optical amplifiers that are integrated into interferometric structures. The first results for monolithic integrated interferometric wavelength converters are reviewed, and the quality of the converted signals is demonstrated by transmission of 10 Gb/s converted signals over 60 km of nondispersion shifted single mode fiber.","doi":"10.1109/50.511594","startPage":"942","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/10994/00511594.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.511594","endPage":"954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10994","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"All-optical wavelength conversion by semiconductor optical amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/511594/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1996","displayDocTitle":"All-optical wavelength conversion by semiconductor optical amplifiers","volume":"14","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5319019","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"All-optical wavelength conversion by semiconductor optical amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00511594.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072175S","chronDate":"Jun 1996","isNumber":"10994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"568","articleId":"511594","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":511596,"authors":[{"name":"T.-P.

The experimental four-node multiwavelength network testbed is SONET/ATM compatible. It has employed multiwavelength DFB laser arrays with 4 nm wavelength spacing for the first time. The testbed has demonstrated that multiwavelength DFB laser arrays are indeed practical and reproducible. For the DFB laser arrays used in such a network the precise wavelength spacing in the array and the absolute wavelength control are the most challenging tasks. We have obtained wavelength accuracy better than /spl plusmn/0.35 nm for all lasers, with some registered to better than /spl plusmn/0.2 nm. We have also studied the array yield of our devices and used wavelength redundancy to improve the array yield. Coupling efficiencies between -2.1 to -4.5 dB for each wavelength channel have been obtained. It is achieved by using specially designed lensed fiber arrays placed on a silicon V-grooved substrate to exactly match the laser spacing. The transmitter consisted of a multichip module containing a DFB laser array, an eight-channel driver array based on GaAs IC's, and associated RF circuitry.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=511596","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical arrays","Optical transmitters","Testing","Fiber lasers","Optical design","Optical fiber networks","Optical device fabrication","SONET","Optical control","Optical fiber devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed feedback lasers","semiconductor lasers","optical transmitters","semiconductor laser arrays","optical fibre networks","SONET","asynchronous transfer mode","integrated optoelectronics","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiwavelength DFB laser array transmitters","ONTC reconfigurable optical network testbed","multiwavelength laser array transmitter design","multiwavelength laser array transmitter fabrication","Optical Network Technology Consortium","four-node multiwavelength network testbed","SONET compatible","ATM compatible","nm wavelength spacing","precise wavelength spacing","absolute wavelength control","wavelength accuracy","wavelength redundancy","array yield","coupling efficiencies","lensed fiber arrays","silicon V-grooved substrate","laser spacing","multichip module","DFB laser array","eight-channel driver array","GaAs IC's","GaAs","Si"]}],"publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/10994/00511596.pdf","startPage":"967","endPage":"976","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10994","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.511596","doi":"10.1109/50.511596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiwavelength DFB laser array transmitters for ONTC reconfigurable optical network testbed","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/511596/","displayDocTitle":"Multiwavelength DFB laser array transmitters for ONTC reconfigurable optical network testbed","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1996","accessionNumber":"5319021","volume":"14","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiwavelength DFB laser array transmitters for ONTC reconfigurable optical network testbed","sourcePdf":"00511596.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084883S","chronDate":"Jun 1996","isNumber":"10994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"55","articleId":"511596","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":511597,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The distinguishing feature of the AO switch is its ability to sustain many independent coexisting passbands, thus allowing in a simple integrated-optic device, the parallel processing capability of much more complex designs. The AOTF has also found a role in active gain equalization of optically amplified networks. In this paper, we review the design of both hybrid and fully integrated AO switches. The theory of operation is reviewed and recent advances in passband engineering are described which have made low-crosstalk, wavelength misalignment-tolerant switches to be possible. Advanced issues such as mechanisms of interchannel crosstalk and its reduction are also discussed. Both device and system issues are covered.","doi":"10.1109/50.511601","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","startPage":"1005","endPage":"1019","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/10994/00511601.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.511601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10994","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolution of the acousto-optic wavelength routing switch","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelength routing","Optical switches","Optical filters","Optical crosstalk","Passband","Optical devices","Wavelength division multiplexing","Parallel processing","Stimulated emission","Optical fiber networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication network routing","acousto-optical switches","tuning","wavelength division multiplexing","integrated optics","band-pass filters","optical fibre networks","equalisers","optical crosstalk","optical communication equipment","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acousto-optic wavelength routing switch","acousto-optic tunable filter","high-performance wavelength-selective optical switching","dense WDM systems","AO switch","independent coexisting passbands","integrated-optic device","parallel processing capability","optically amplified networks","fully integrated AO switches","passband engineering","low-crosstalk","wavelength misalignment-tolerant switches","interchannel crosstalk"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1996","displayDocTitle":"Evolution of the acousto-optic wavelength routing switch","volume":"14","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5319026","publicationDate":"June 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/511601/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolution of the acousto-optic wavelength routing switch","sourcePdf":"00511601.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080195S","chronDate":"Jun 1996","isNumber":"10994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"66","articleId":"511601","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":511611,"authors":[{"name":"H.

It is shown that the crosstalk must be less than -38 dB for a 16/spl times/16 system to keep the power penalty below 1 dB at a bit error rate of 10/sup -9/.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/10994/00511611.pdf","startPage":"1097","endPage":"1105","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/50.511611","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.511611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10994","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=511611","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of crosstalk in an arrayed-waveguide multiplexer on N/spl times/N optical interconnection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical arrays","Multiplexing","Optical interconnections","Optical receivers","Optical transmitters","Optical noise","Optical crosstalk","Wavelength routing","Optical devices","Arrayed waveguide gratings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical waveguides","optical crosstalk","optical noise","optical interconnections","optical fibre couplers","Gaussian noise","optical fibre networks","wavelength division multiplexing","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crosstalk","arrayed-waveguide multiplexer","N/spl times/N optical interconnection","arrayed-waveguide N/spl times/N wavelength multiplexer","wavelength-routing N/spl times/N all optical networks","systems multiple crosstalk light","signal-crosstalk beat noise","Gaussian noise","power penalty","bit error rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/511611/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1996","displayDocTitle":"Impact of crosstalk in an arrayed-waveguide multiplexer on N/spl times/N optical interconnection","volume":"14","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1996","accessionNumber":"5319036","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of crosstalk in an arrayed-waveguide multiplexer on N/spl times/N optical interconnection","sourcePdf":"00511611.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136058S","chronDate":"Jun 1996","isNumber":"10994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"214","articleId":"511611","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":511614,"authors":[{"name":"K.-P.

The optical carrier at each wavelength is modulated with a subcarrier tone unique to that wavelength. The level of crosstalk from a given channel can be determined by measuring the power of the corresponding tone. Crosstalk from other channels can be cancelled in a linear fashion by weighting and summing the photocurrents of the desired channel and several adjacent interfering channels. Alternatively, in nonlinear crosstalk cancellation, decisions are made on the interfering signals, and these decision are weighted and summed with the photocurrent of the desired channel. For example, assuming an optical filter having a Gaussian passband, the channel density can be increased from 20 to 30%, depending on the number of adjacent channels detected. The signal-to-interference ratio can be increased by 10-20 dB and the system can achieve a BER<10/sup -9/ under conditions where, without interference cancellation, the signal-to-interference ratio would be less then 10 dB.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/10994/00511614.pdf","startPage":"1127","endPage":"1135","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/50.511614","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.511614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10994","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=511614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Methods for crosstalk measurement and reduction in dense WDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelength division multiplexing","Optical filters","Wavelength measurement","Nonlinear optics","Optical crosstalk","Optical modulation","Photoconductivity","Monitoring","Band pass filters","Power measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelength division multiplexing","optical fibre networks","optical crosstalk","band-pass filters","optical filters","photoconductivity","optical noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crosstalk measurement","dense WDM system reduction","monitoring","limited stop-band rejection","optical bandpass filters","dense WDM systems","optical carrier modulation","subcarrier tone","crosstalk","photocurrents","adjacent interfering channels","nonlinear crosstalk cancellation","interfering signals","optical filter","Gaussian passband","channel density","signal-to-interference ratio","interference cancellation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/511614/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1996","displayDocTitle":"Methods for crosstalk measurement and reduction in dense WDM systems","volume":"14","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1996","accessionNumber":"5319039","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Methods for crosstalk measurement and reduction in dense WDM systems","sourcePdf":"00511614.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086085S","chronDate":"Jun 1996","isNumber":"10994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"34","articleId":"511614","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":511618,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Electronic translation means that an optical signal on one wavelength is converted to electronics and then converted again into an optical signal on another wavelength. A previous study has demonstrated that all-optical wavelength translation can significantly improve the performance of a large mesh network. In this paper, we consider an optical network architecture based on a mesh topology where each node is supplied with an array of W transmitters and receivers (where W is the number of wavelengths). For this architecture, we study effectiveness of electronic wavelength translation as a low cost alternative to all-optical wavelength translation. We propose wavelength assignment algorithms over a given routing path which minimize the number of wavelength changes. The results of our performance study for a static routing mesh network show that electronic translation with such algorithms can be almost as effective as all-optical wavelength translation. In fact, the performance of electronic translation converge to those of all-optical translation as the size of a large mesh increases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/511618/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1996","volume":"14","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1996","accessionNumber":"5319043","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Electronic wavelength translation in optical networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electronic wavelength translation in optical networks","sourcePdf":"00511618.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031137S","chronDate":"Jun 1996","isNumber":"10994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"22","articleId":"511618","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":511621,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Slotless axial-flux permanent magnet machines (AFPMs) prove to be the best candidate for application in electric vehicles as direct-drive wheel motors, as in comparison with conventional machines they allow designs with higher compactness, lightness and efficiency. The paper presents a newly conceived AFPM which has a multistage structure and a water-cooled ironless stator. In the proposed new topology of the machine, the space formerly occupied by the toroidal core becomes a water duct, which removes heat directly from the interior surface of the stator winding. The high efficiency of the machine cooling arrangement allows long-term 100% overload operation and great reduction of the machine weight. The multistage structure of the machine is suited to overcome the restriction on the machine diameter and meet the torque required at the wheel shaft. The paper gives guidelines for the design of a multistage AFPM with water-cooled ironless stator, and describes characteristics of a two-stage prototype machine rated 215 Nm, 1100 RPM.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wheels","Permanent magnet motors","Torque","Stator cores","Space heating","Permanent magnet machines","Electric vehicles","Topology","Ducts","Water heating"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicles","electric propulsion","permanent magnet motors","traction motor drives","stators","cooling","design engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct-drive wheel motors","design guidelines","slotless axial-flux permanent magnet machines","electric vehicles","application","multistage structure","water-cooled ironless stator","water duct","heat removal","efficiency"]}],"doi":"10.1109/28.511645","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/11125/00511645.pdf","startPage":"882","endPage":"888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.511645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multistage axial-flux PM machine for wheel direct drive","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=511645","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multistage axial-flux PM machine for wheel direct drive","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/511645/","volume":"32","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1996","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5354929","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multistage axial-flux PM machine for wheel direct drive","sourcePdf":"00511645.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050092S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1996","isNumber":"11125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"76","articleId":"511645","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":511646,"authors":[{"name":"A.G.

Recent work by the authors suggests that with careful design a similar degree of fault tolerance may be achieved with a permanent magnet machine (PM) at a significantly higher torque density than its SRM counterpart. This latter suggestion is of crucial importance in high performance applications, such as aerospace, where a low mass is essential. This paper is concerned with reporting measured results from a fault tolerant PM machine, and using these results to examine the relative merits of SR and PM technology for this application.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparative study of permanent magnet and switched reluctance motors for high-performance fault-tolerant applications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/28.511646","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/11125/00511646.pdf","startPage":"889","endPage":"895","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.511646","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11125","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=511646","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/511646/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"A comparative study of permanent magnet and switched reluctance motors for high-performance fault-tolerant applications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5354930","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparative study of permanent magnet and switched reluctance motors for high-performance fault-tolerant applications","sourcePdf":"00511646.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042076S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1996","isNumber":"11125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"291","articleId":"511646","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":511647,"authors":[{"name":"B.J.

To obtain a performance characteristic suitable for a typical electric vehicle drive, in which short-term increase of current is applied, it is necessary to design an optimum value of direct-axis inductance. The paper presents an analysis of a hybrid motor design which uses a two-part rotor construction comprising a surface-magnet part and an axially laminated reluctance part. This arrangement combines the properties of all other types of synchronous motor and offers a greater choice of design variables.

Intensive research effort has been for sometime focused on the motor current signature analysis (MCSA). The MCSA techniques utilize the results of spectral analysis of the stator current. Reliable interpretation of the spectra is difficult, since distortions of the current waveform caused by the abnormalities in the drive system are usually minute. In this paper, an alternate medium for the motor signature analysis, namely the instantaneous power, is proposed. By theoretical analysis, computer simulations, and laboratory experiments, it is shown that the instantaneous power carries more information than the current itself. Utilization of the instantaneous power is thus enhancing the reliability of diagnostics of induction motor drives.","doi":"10.1109/28.511648","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/11125/00511648.pdf","startPage":"904","endPage":"909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.511648","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Instantaneous power as a medium for the signature analysis of induction motors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=511648","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/511648/","displayDocTitle":"Instantaneous power as a medium for the signature analysis of induction motors","volume":"32","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5354932","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Instantaneous power as a medium for the signature analysis of induction motors","sourcePdf":"00511648.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029926S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1996","isNumber":"11125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"134","articleId":"511648","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":511649,"authors":[{"name":"H.A.

Analysis is presented to show that the distributed LC of a cable and the pulse-width modulated (PWM) inverter switching action lead to motor terminal voltage reflections and ringing that stress the turn insulation and contribute to bearing currents. First- and second-order shunt filter designs are analyzed and compared. Detailed design equations to match the filter impedance to the cable surge impedance and to determine the filter component values are presented. It is demonstrated that a first-order shunt filter connected at the motor terminals significantly reduces the overvoltage stress and ringing, and also lowers the dv/dt of the PWM switching pulse.

The dynamic analysis and description of revolving field machines is supported by well-established theories: Park's transformation (1929), and the space vector theory by Kovacs and Racz (1959). Yet some inconsistencies with the theory of dynamic systems exist. First, the machine eigenvalues suggest the existence of two damped oscillators. Second, it appears unsatisfactory that the respective eigenfrequencies change with the velocity of the reference frame. This contradicts the common understanding according to which the eigenfrequency is an inherent system property. A clarification is reached using a novel approach for dynamic AC machine analysis. The approach is based on complex state variables. It permits relating a transient condition to the propagation processes in the space of distributed magnetic fields. The formal analysis constitutes an extension to the space vector theory and to the theory of dynamic systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the spatial propagation of transient magnetic fields in AC machines","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/28.511651","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/11125/00511651.pdf","startPage":"927","endPage":"937","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.511651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11125","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=511651","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/511651/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"On the spatial propagation of transient magnetic fields in AC machines","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5354935","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the spatial propagation of transient magnetic fields in AC machines","sourcePdf":"00511651.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038097S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1996","isNumber":"11125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"29","articleId":"511651","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":511655,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-F.

The SVC consists of four three-phase voltage-source inverters having a common DC capacitor and four three-phase transformers, the primary windings of which are connected in series with each other. Although each inverter outputs a square wave voltage, the synthesized AC voltage of the SVC has a 24-step waveshape. This results not only in a great reduction of harmonic currents and DC voltage ripples but also in less switching and snubbing losses.

Experimental results obtained from a 10-kVA laboratory system are shown to agree well with the analytical results, thus verifying the analysis and leading to the design of DC capacitance value.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and design of a DC voltage-controlled static VAr compensator using quad-series voltage-source inverters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/28.511656","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/11125/00511656.pdf","startPage":"970","endPage":"978","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.511656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11125","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=511656","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/511656/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and design of a DC voltage-controlled static VAr compensator using quad-series voltage-source inverters","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5354940","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and design of a DC voltage-controlled static VAr compensator using quad-series voltage-source inverters","sourcePdf":"00511656.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.01942S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1996","isNumber":"11125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"219","articleId":"511656","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":511660,"authors":[{"name":"K.M.

A previous hybrid access protocol, consisting of reservation and receiver channels preallocation, allows reservation for exactly one channel per node during the reservation phase. We extend this protocol by allowing reservations on multiple channels and applying scheduling algorithms to improve network performance. Existing scheduling algorithms for similar reservation problems, although providing optimal scheduling for network utilization, have unacceptable computational cost and high implementation complexity. We propose two on-line scheduling algorithms which run in linear time and are simple, making them amenable for hardware implementation. Performance of the protocol using scheduling with varying system parameters is evaluated through discrete-event simulation under both uniform and nonuniform traffic patterns. Our simulation results show that our approach achieves lower average packet latency and higher network utilization compared to the early hybrid access protocol, especially in the client-server environment.","doi":"10.1109/50.511660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.511660","startPage":"1278","endPage":"1286","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/10994/00511660.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10994","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Media access protocols for WDM networks with on-line scheduling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1996","displayDocTitle":"Media access protocols for WDM networks with on-line scheduling","publicationDate":"June 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"14","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5319053","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/511660/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Media access protocols for WDM networks with on-line scheduling","sourcePdf":"00511660.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040799S","chronDate":"Jun 1996","isNumber":"10994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"26","articleId":"511660","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":511664,"authors":[{"name":"Gee-Kung Chang","affiliation":["Bellcore, Red Bank, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Gee-Kung Chang","id":"37276511800"},{"name":"G.

It has been established that the intraband crosstalk, where the crosstalk elements fall within the signal wavelength carrier band, is much more deleterious to the network end-end transparency performance. Three multi-/spl lambda/ OXC node architectures realising similar optical cross-connecting functions have been analyzed.

If the statistics of the detected signal are Gaussian, a common assumption, then the bit-error rate (BER) performance of the system is predicted to reach a minimum that cannot be improved by increasing the received optical power. The actual performance, however, depends on the true detection noise statistics. We have measured the statistical distribution of the photoelectric current from a PIN photodiode illuminated by a spectrum-sliced, erbium-doped SFS. The histogram of the measurement data is best described by a negative binomial model for the corresponding photoelectron count with thermal light. Consequently, the BER performance of a spectrum-sliced WDMA system using such a superfluorescent fiber source is not limited by the SNR, a fundamentally different result from that predicted using the Gaussian assumption.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/511675/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1996","publicationDate":"June 1996","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5319068","volume":"14","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Photoelectric current distribution and bit error rate in optical communication systems using a superfluorescent fiber source","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Photoelectric current distribution and bit error rate in optical communication systems using a superfluorescent fiber source","sourcePdf":"00511675.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072247S","chronDate":"Jun 1996","isNumber":"10994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"11","articleId":"511675","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":511683,"authors":[{"name":"L.F.

In the first, the MLECG was decorrelated using a discrete cosine transform (DCT) and then a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) was applied on each channel after the removal of the least significant channels in the DCT domain. Significant compression ratios (CR) were achieved by retaining only the consequential DWT coefficients. The full potential of DWT was further exploited by appropriate quantization of these coefficients. Near perfect reconstruction was obtained for a CR of 1:8. This approach is highly suited for real time applications including that of high frequency Holter ECG. In the other algorithm, first level of compression was achieved by truncating the DWT while storing the highly significant coefficients from the truncated portion. Transform domain pole-zero modeling (TDPM) was then applied on the DWT compressed ECG to achieve higher compression ratios. In TDPM the DCT of a cycle of ECG is modeled as the impulse response of a pole-zero filter using Smith's (1983) method. Further compression was achieved by the application of vector quantization (VQ) on the model parameters. This algorithm resulted in a CR of 1:80 without significant distortion. The accuracy of reconstruction was checked using both qualitative and quantitative measures. The proposed algorithms were validated on both standard and local databases.","doi":"10.1109/RCEMBS.1995.511732","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the First Regional Conference, IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society and 14th Conference of the Biomedical Engineering Society of India.

Although they will doubtless employ the old reliable 12 V lead-acid battery, their loads will be driven by a variety of voltages, both AC and DC, perhaps derived from a single AC distribution network. Designers will be able to match voltages to individual loads for best efficiency and performance-lights perhaps at 6 V AC, electronics at 5 V DC, active suspension at 350 V DC, and motors and actuators at 42 V DC. The digital signals controlling those loads will be carried by a separate communications network. The enabling technology for these advances are semiconductors.

The method's performance was validated in eight MR images by comparison to observer-defined independent standards. The GA-based image interpretation method correctly interpreted neuroanatomic structures in all images from the test set. Computer-identified and observer-defined neuroanatomic structure areas correlated very well (r=0.99, y=0,95x-2.1).

The separable wavelet transform employs one filter bank within two-dimensional (2-D) slices and then a second filter bank on the slice direction. CT and MR image sets normally have different resolutions within a slice and between slices. The pixel distances within a slice are normally less than 1 mm and the distance between slices can vary from 1 mm to 10 mm. To find the best filter bank in the slice direction, the authors use the various filter banks in the slice direction and compare the compression results. The results from the 12 selected MR and CT image sets at various slice thickness show that the Haar transform in the slice direction gives the optimum performance for most image sets, except for a CT image set which has 1 mm slice distance. Compared with 2-D wavelet compression, compression ratios of the 3-D method are about 70% higher for CT and 35% higher for MR image sets at a peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) of 50 dB, In general, the smaller the slice distance, the better the 3-D compression performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Medical image compression by using three-dimensional wavelet transformation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/42.511757","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/11126/00511757.pdf","startPage":"547","endPage":"554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.511757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11126","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=511757","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/511757/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1996","displayDocTitle":"Medical image compression by using three-dimensional wavelet transformation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5359435","pubMedId":"18215935","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Medical image compression by using three-dimensional wavelet transformation","sourcePdf":"00511757.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070548S","chronDate":"Aug.  1996","isNumber":"11126","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"63","articleId":"511757","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":511759,"authors":[{"name":"Kuo-Sheng Cheng","affiliation":["Institute of Biomedical Engineering, National Engineering Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kuo-Sheng Cheng","id":"37087181269"},{"name":"Jzau-Sheng Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, National Engineering Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jzau-Sheng Lin","id":"37086979822"},{"name":"Chi-Wu Mao","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, National Engineering Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chi-Wu Mao","id":"37087289340"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0062"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-254X"}],"articleNumber":"511759","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":109,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":852},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hopfield neural networks","Biomedical imaging","Image segmentation","Medical diagnostic imaging","Pixel","Medical simulation","Anatomical structure","Brain","Multi-layer neural network","Learning systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","Hopfield neural nets","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["competitive Hopfield neural network","medical image segmentation","parallel unsupervised approach","winner-takes-all learning mechanism","minimization energy function","gray level distribution","squared distance measures","interesting objects","fuzzy c-means method","medical diagnostic imaging"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=511759","abstract":"In this paper, a parallel and unsupervised approach using the competitive Hopfield neural network (CHNN) is proposed for medical image segmentation. It is a kind of Hopfield network which incorporates the winner-takes-all (WTA) learning mechanism. The image segmentation is conceptually formulated as a problem of pixel clustering based upon the global information of the gray level distribution. Thus, the energy function for minimization is defined as the mean of the squared distance measures of the gray levels within each class. The proposed network avoids the onerous procedure of determining values for the weighting factors in the energy function. In addition, its training scheme enables the network to learn rapidly and effectively. For an image of n gray levels and c interesting objects, the proposed CHNN would consist of n by c neurons and be independent of the image size. In both simulation studies and practical medical image segmentation, the CHNN method shows promising results in comparison with two well-known methods: the hard and the fuzzy c-means (FCM) methods.","doi":"10.1109/42.511759","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00511759.png","startPage":"560","endPage":"567","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.511759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11126","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/11126/00511759.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The application of competitive Hopfield neural network to medical image segmentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/511759/","displayDocTitle":"The application of competitive Hopfield neural network to medical image segmentation","volume":"15","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5359437","pubMedId":"18215937","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The application of competitive Hopfield neural network to medical image segmentation","sourcePdf":"00511759.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041822S","chronDate":"Aug.  1996","isNumber":"11126","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"109","articleId":"511759","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-07"},{"_id":511762,"authors":[{"name":"I.

These markets are extremely cost conscious and demand solutions in the under five dollar price range. Previous low cost solutions relied on coarse properties of the speech signal, such as the amplitude envelope or zero crossing rates, and typically yielded poor recognition performance. Digital signal processor based approaches can achieve adequate performance but are beyond the low cost market's reach.

In the past, steelmakers had to develop and program special analytical models, a laborious and time consuming process. Neural networks are simple mathematical structures that gather knowledge by learning from examples, which a computer can do automatically. Besides being so much quicker and easier, neural models also often achieve better performance than do analytical models in practical applications. Second, neural networks can handle highly nonlinear problems, making them vastly superior to classical linear approaches. Finally, neural network are able to adapt online.

Knowledge based systems (KBS) in particular have helped numerous Fortune 1000 companies solve pressing business problems-everything from scheduling their manufacturing operations to managing their investment portfolios. AI has helped many companies improve productivity and reduce costs to meet the demands of today's competitive global economy. Today, business management itself is undergoing fundamental change. For the past several years, business process reengineering (BPR) has become the watchword. This move to rethink and redesign the way a company works aims at further boosting productivity and cutting costs. No wonder then that business managers worldwide are turning to explicit KBS techniques, long proven to achieve the very goals of BPR, to model change. The first wave of AI based tools and applications for business process modeling (BPM) is just hitting the shore. Organizations such as IBM, EDS, the US Army, and Swiss Bank are among the first to adopt AI for BPM. Some are using traditional KBS tools such as ART*Enterprise and ProKappa, while others are turning to ReThink, the first AI tool designed specifically for BPM.","doi":"10.1109/64.511772","publicationTitle":"IEEE Expert","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Expert","pdfPath":"/iel3/64/11141/00511772.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/64.511772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AI tools for business-process modeling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/511772/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"AI tools for business-process modeling","volume":"11","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5350143","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AI tools for business-process modeling","sourcePdf":"00511772.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07998S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"64","citationCount":"6","articleId":"511772","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":511774,"authors":[{"name":"P.

By projecting the scene to be ray traced onto perpendicular planes, subdividing the planes with a 2D subdivision scheme (regular grid- and quadtree structures) and traversing these projected scenes throughout the subdividing structures, the methods reported upon exploit the advantages of the 3D voxel- and octree-based acceleration techniques, without having their disadvantage of large memory consumption. Utilizing bounding rectangular extents around the primitives constituting the scene, the techniques covered can be beneficial for many different types of primitives to be ray traced. Results given for the regular grid- and quadtree-based techniques illustrate that even on single-processor machines it becomes viable to ray trace complex scenes-we tested the algorithms presented with scenes containing up to one million primitives-in an affordable time (i.e. in the order of minutes rather than hours or days).","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of CG International '96","pdfPath":"/iel3/3814/11156/00511786.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"53","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of CG International '96","doi":"10.1109/CGI.1996.511786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CGI.1996.511786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11156","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=511786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ray tracing optimization utilizing projective methods","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ray tracing","Optimization methods","Layout","Acceleration","Testing","Image generation","Computer graphics","Data structures","Programmable control","Adaptive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ray tracing","optimisation","computer graphics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ray tracing optimization","projective methods","2D subdivision scheme","quadtree structures","3D voxel","acceleration techniques","single-processor machines"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/511786/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Jun 1996","displayDocTitle":"Ray tracing optimization utilizing projective methods","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5368683","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ray tracing optimization utilizing projective methods","confLoc":"Pohang, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"00511786.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030674S","chronDate":"24-28 Jun 1996","isNumber":"11156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3814","citationCount":"1","articleId":"511786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":511806,"authors":[{"name":"Woo Jin Oh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Woo Jin Oh","id":"37352277600"},{"name":"Yong Hoon Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yong Hoon Lee","id":"37352277900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"511806","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Nonlinear filters","Polynomials","Equalizers","Mixed integer linear programming","Design methodology","Iterative algorithms","Transfer functions","Attenuation","Passband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FIR filters","cascade networks","equalisers","polynomials","circuit optimisation","linear programming","integer programming","transfer functions","filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclotomic polynomial prefilters","FIR filters design","mixed integer linear programming","optimization problem","linear objective functions","logarithms","transfer function","cascaded FIR prefilter-equalizers","finite impulse response filters"]}],"abstract":"The cyclotomic polynomial (CP) prefilter design problem is formulated as an optimization problem with linear objective functions by applying logarithms to the transfer function of the CP prefilter.

These results have significant robustness implications for adaptive detection/estimation/beamforming in non-Gaussian environments.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/97.511810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11151","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/97/11151/00511810.pdf","endPage":"252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A note on non-Gaussian adaptive array detection and signal parameter estimation","doi":"10.1109/97.511810","startPage":"251","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=511810","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1996","displayDocTitle":"A note on non-Gaussian adaptive array detection and signal parameter estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/511810/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5348447","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"3","issue":"8","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A note on non-Gaussian adaptive array detection and signal parameter estimation","sourcePdf":"00511810.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042306S","chronDate":"Aug.  1996","isNumber":"11151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"48","articleId":"511810","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":511811,"authors":[{"name":"Eng-Siong Chng","affiliation":["Institute of Systems Science, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Eng-Siong Chng","id":"37087332252"},{"name":"H.H.

The FDTD has, for some time, been able to model the near-zone scattered fields of buried objects due to near-zone sources. This is adequate for modeling the scattered returns of ground-based ground-penetrating radar, but not for airborne radar. This paper describes an FDTD-compatible technique whereby far-zone scattered fields of objects buried in a stratified ground can be calculated. This technique uses the equivalence principle to model a buried object in terms of equivalent electric and magnetic currents. The fields radiated by these currents in the presence of a stratified ground are then calculated using the reciprocity theorem and the well-known field equations for plane waves in a stratified media. Numerical results are presented that show excellent agreement between this technique and both analytical and numerical results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/11152/00511824.pdf","startPage":"1150","endPage":"1157","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.511824","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.511824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11152","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=511824","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FDTD near- to far-zone transformation for scatterers buried in stratified grounds","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Radar scattering","Electromagnetic scattering","Buried object detection","Electromagnetic propagation","Airborne radar","Hardware","Nonuniform electric fields","Integral equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","radar cross-sections","electromagnetic fields","electric current","airborne radar","electromagnetic wave scattering","electromagnetic wave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near to far zone transformation","buried scatterers","stratified grounds","finite difference time domain","scattering characteristics","buried objects","near zone scattered fields","near zone sources","scattered returns modeling","ground based ground penetrating radar","airborne radar","far-zone scattered fields","equivalence principle","equivalent electric current","radiated fields","reciprocity theorem","field equations","plane wave","numerical results","analytical results","EM wave propagation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/511824/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"An FDTD near- to far-zone transformation for scatterers buried in stratified grounds","volume":"44","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5349386","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FDTD near- to far-zone transformation for scatterers buried in stratified grounds","sourcePdf":"00511824.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055933S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"60","articleId":"511824","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":511827,"authors":[{"name":"T.P.

This synopsis reviews the available literature on numerical integration over triangular and tetrahedral domains.","doi":"10.1109/74.511963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11097","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/74.511963","endPage":"102","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel4/74/11097/00511963.pdf","startPage":"100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quadrature rules for numerical integration over triangles and tetrahedra","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/511963/","displayDocTitle":"Quadrature rules for numerical integration over triangles and tetrahedra","volume":"38","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"5345646","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1996","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quadrature rules for numerical integration over triangles and tetrahedra","sourcePdf":"00511963.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051445S","chronDate":"June  1996","isNumber":"11097","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"18","articleId":"511963","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":511968,"authors":[{"name":"C.

In this paradigm, a technical writer generates a source text, which is translated by the computer system into another language and then edited. One problem with machine translation, however, is that its output is typically constrained by the original text's style and language. Automatic language-generation systems, however, start with an underlying knowledge base that represents the text's content without dictating its language or style. However, most automatic systems are stand-alone tools, leaving technical writers out of the loop. The systems assume that an underlying knowledge base containing the necessary information is available or can be easily obtained. This is not necessarily the case, though, when producing instruction manuals. For example, the knowledge base required to produce instructions should contain user-oriented information. User-oriented documentation, which concerns the ways the product can help users achieve their goals, is more effective than documentation that focuses on the product. Only a technical writer can specify user-oriented information. It is thus prefer able to have a document-generation system that works with the writer. With this in mind, we developed Drafter, an interactive document drafting tool that can be integrated into the technical writers' working practices and that can automatically and simultaneously generate appropriately worded drafts in several languages. Drafter's current domain of application is software manuals.","doi":"10.1109/2.511968","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","startPage":"49","endPage":"56","publicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel1/2/11070/00511968.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2.511968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11070","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An interactive support tool for writing multilingual manuals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Writing","Manuals","Documentation","Prototypes","Production","Companies","Automation","Costs","Technical drawing","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["user manuals","system documentation","knowledge based systems","document handling","language translation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilingual manual writing","interactive support tool","machine translation","automated multilingual document production","technical writer","source text","automatic language-generation systems","knowledge base","instruction manuals","user-oriented information","user-oriented documentation","Drafter","interactive document drafting tool","software manuals"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1996","displayDocTitle":"An interactive support tool for writing multilingual manuals","volume":"29","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5342985","publicationDate":"July 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/511968/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An interactive support tool for writing multilingual manuals","sourcePdf":"00511968.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040435S","chronDate":"Jul 1996","isNumber":"11070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"14","articleId":"511968","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":511977,"authors":[{"name":"H.

As with other maturing media technologies, the focus is moving from technology to content, as commercial vendors and developers try to use network technology to deliver media products for profit. This shift inevitably raises questions about how to protect ownership rights. Digital watermarking has been proposed as a way to identify the source, creator, owner, distributor, or authorized consumer of a document or image. Its objective is to permanently and unalterably mark the image so that the credit or assignment is beyond dispute. In the event of illicit use, the watermark would facilitate the claim of ownership, the receipt of copyright revenues, or successful prosecution. Watermarking has also been proposed for tracing images that have been illicitly redistributed. In the past, the infeasibility of large-scale photocopying and distribution often limited copyright infringement, but modern digital networks make large-scale dissemination simple and inexpensive. Digital watermarking allows each image to be uniquely marked for every buyer. If that buyer makes an illicit copy, the copy itself identifies the buyer as the source.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/511977/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1996","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5342982","volume":"29","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Protecting ownership rights through digital watermarking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Protecting ownership rights through digital watermarking","sourcePdf":"00511977.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023899S","chronDate":"Jul 1996","isNumber":"11070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"102","articleId":"511977","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":511982,"authors":[{"name":"K.R.

Using the recursive equation for the admittance of a tree, we give the exact expressions for the first and second moments of the transfer function of the interconnect tree. Our results show that delay estimates using our method are within 13% of SPICE-computed delays.

The situation which prevails today is that component manufacturers supply to end-users experimental data which characterizes the thermal behaviour of packages under a set of standardized and idealized conditions. Such characterizations normally involve the junction-to-case thermal resistance or the junction-to-ambient resistance according to MIL or SEMI standards. There are several practical difficulties associated with such an approach, which will be briefly commented upon. Today, the need for more accurate junction temperature prediction becomes increasingly urgent, and the call for a precise definition of the various thermal resistances is heard by a growing number of researchers. The paper continues with a survey of the open literature and discusses the pros and cons of several methods that describe the thermal behaviour of electronic parts. It is concluded that none of these methods is capable of meeting the objectives that are proposed. A novel approach is introduced, based on the derivation of a simple resistance network starting from a detailed model using optimization techniques. The proposed method is applied to two cases: a so-called 'validation' chip, functioning as a benchmark for the software that is used to generate the detailed model, and a 208-PQFP component. It is demonstrated that it is possible to create a compact model comprising a simple resistance network, representing the detailed model to a high accuracy which is independent of the boundary conditions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thermal resistance","Thermal conductivity","Electronic packaging thermal management","Temperature sensors","Resistance heating","Heat transfer","Temperature measurement","Equations","Bridges","Manufacturing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal resistance","integrated circuit packaging","plastic packaging","boundary-value problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal characterization","electronic parts","operating temperatures","standardized input data","packages","junction-to-case thermal resistance","junction-to-ambient resistance","resistance network","validation chip","208-PQFP component"]}],"doi":"10.1109/STHERM.1995.512044","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE/CPMT 11th Semiconductor Thermal Measurement and Management Symposium (SEMI-THERM)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE/CPMT 11th Semiconductor Thermal Measurement and Management Symposium (SEMI-THERM)","pdfPath":"/iel3/3862/11279/00512044.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/STHERM.1995.512044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel approach for the thermal characterization of electronic parts","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=512044","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel approach for the thermal characterization of electronic parts","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/512044/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5043983","conferenceDate":"7-9 Feb. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Feb 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel approach for the thermal characterization of electronic parts","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00512044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056392S","chronDate":"7-9 Feb 1995","isNumber":"11279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3862","citationCount":"74","articleId":"512044","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":512077,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this paper, we propose a new 5-input 3-output AND-XOR based logic block architecture built around Cellular Automata Array (CAA). An efficient multi-level AND-XOR minimizer has been developed. A generic library based technology mapping technique has been evolved. Experimentation with a large number of XOR dominated MCNC benchmarks establishes the superiority of our logic block over those of Xilinx and Actel for these functions. The mapping scheme is a generic one and thus can be used to evaluate any arbitrary multi-output as well as single-output logic block.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/512078/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Jan 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5044151","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 1995","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"Technology mapping on a multi-output logic module built around Cellular Automata Array for a new FPGA architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Technology mapping on a multi-output logic module built around Cellular Automata Array for a new FPGA architecture","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"00512078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027494S","chronDate":"4-7 Jan 1995","isNumber":"11274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3858","articleId":"512078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":512079,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Analytic expressions for the gain compression (AM-AM) and amplitude dependent phase distortion (AM-PM) of a nonlinear amplifier are derived from a third-order Volterra series model. The cases of a single-tone and of a two-tone signal are explored. We show that the gain compression characteristics of nonlinear amplifiers depend on the amplitude modulation characteristics of the signal. Furthermore, we show that the time-averaged phase deviation is independent of the modulation envelope. This justifies the new model proposed for obtaining the envelope transfer characteristics by applying the Bessel-Fourier technique only to the AM-AM characteristic. This model is verified by comparing spectral regrowth simulations of digitally-modulated signals to those measured in a 1.9 GHz GaAs FET power amplifier.","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel3/3773/11022/00512194.pdf","startPage":"1385","endPage":"1388 vol.3","publicationTitle":"1996 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1996.512194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1996.512194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11022","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=512194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Behavioral modeling of narrowband microwave power amplifiers with applications in simulating spectral regrowth","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Narrowband","Microwave amplifiers","Power amplifiers","Power system modeling","Computational modeling","Predictive models","Nonlinear distortion","Power measurement","Phase distortion","Circuit simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave power amplifiers","circuit analysis computing","Volterra series","amplitude modulation","Bessel functions","gallium arsenide","III-V semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["narrowband microwave power amplifiers","behavioral modeling","spectral regrowth","gain compression","amplitude dependent phase distortion","nonlinear amplifier","third-order Volterra series model","single-tone signal","two-tone signal","amplitude modulation characteristics","time-averaged phase deviation","modulation envelope","envelope transfer characteristics","Bessel-Fourier technique","digitally-modulated signals","1.9 GHz","GaAs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/512194/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-21 June 1996","displayDocTitle":"Behavioral modeling of narrowband microwave power amplifiers with applications in simulating spectral regrowth","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5358315","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"17-21 June 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Behavioral modeling of narrowband microwave power amplifiers with applications in simulating spectral regrowth","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00512194.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032186S","chronDate":"17-21 June 1996","isNumber":"11022","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3773","citationCount":"22","articleId":"512194","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":512201,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In MR/FDTD the problem domain is broken into several independent FDTD sub-region lattices. The sub-region lattices are terminated using a single surface integral radiation boundary condition applied simultaneously to all sub-regions providing mutual interaction between the sub-regions. The advantages of MR/FDTD for sparse modeling problems include computational and memory efficiencies that result from confining the FDTD lattices to the space near objects and the ability to use different lattices and/or lattice orientations within each sub-region. MR/FDTD also eliminates the need for local absorbing boundary conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel3/3773/11022/00512215.pdf","startPage":"1475","endPage":"1478 vol.3","publicationTitle":"1996 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1996.512215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1996.512215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11022","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=512215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple region FDTD (MR/FDTD) and its application to microwave analysis and modeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Lattices","Boundary conditions","Electromagnetic scattering","Buffer layers","Integral equations","Computational modeling","Robustness","Difference equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","sparse matrices","microwave circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple region FDTD","MR/FDTD","microwave analysis","sub-region lattices","surface integral radiation boundary condition","sparse modeling problems","computational efficiencies","lattice orientations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/512215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-21 June 1996","displayDocTitle":"Multiple region FDTD (MR/FDTD) and its application to microwave analysis and modeling","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5358336","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"17-21 June 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple region FDTD (MR/FDTD) and its application to microwave analysis and modeling","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00512215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0448S","chronDate":"17-21 June 1996","isNumber":"11022","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3773","citationCount":"9","articleId":"512215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":512238,"authors":[{"name":"M.Y.

As designs become more complex, simulation is challenged throughout the design and verification process, both at the low level (implementation verification), to show that a low level implementation implements a higher-level specification, and at the high level (design verification), to show that a design complies with some abstract specification. In both areas, formal methods can extend the reach of simulation: for implementation verification, equivalence checking is used to show that two circuits are functionally the same in some well defined sense. For design verification, model checking and other property checking techniques serve as a smart simulator. This paper describes Forte, a formal verification prototype that integrates formal verification and simulation. Forte fits into a standard top-down design flow using standard HDL's such as Verilog-HDL and VHDL, and works well with synthesis. Forte includes traditional and symbolic simulation, combinational and sequential equivalence, and CTL model checking. We discuss its design and implementation, and illustrate the utility of combining formal verification and simulation using an example. Moreover, Forte's object-oriented design makes it an ideal platform for rapidly evaluating new ideas in verification.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An integrated environment for HDL verification","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1995 IEEE International Verilog HDL Conference","doi":"10.1109/IVC.1995.512463","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1995 IEEE International Verilog HDL Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/3876/11298/00512463.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"18","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVC.1995.512463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11298","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=512463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/512463/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"An integrated environment for HDL verification","conferenceDate":"27-29 March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"4924009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An integrated environment for HDL verification","confLoc":"Santa Cruz, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00512463.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052255S","chronDate":"27-29 Mar 1995","isNumber":"11298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3876","citationCount":"7","articleId":"512463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":512515,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It takes into account the unequal thermal distribution of temperature for multi-finger HBT devices, the impact ionization, tunnelling, recombination currents etc. From the simulation of multi-finger transistor structures it can be concluded that high thermal device resistances are detrimental for power performance, because of the unequal distribution of temperature and hence base current in the HBT structure. It can also be concluded that the input and output reflection coefficients are insensitive to temperature variation.

Such a scheme, implemented on the uplink, ensures that all users' signals arrive at the base station with equal average power as they move within the satellite spot beam. Because of the lengthy round-trip delay on a satellite link, closed-loop power control systems are only of marginal benefit. Therefore, an open-loop APC scheme is proposed to counteract the effects of shadowing on a frequency-selective multipath fading channel. The power control scheme has been simulated. It has been found that the power control error can be approximated by a log-normally distributed random variable.

For a theoretical analysis of the system, a simplified two-ray channel model has been adopted; each ray has a log-normal distribution. Moreover, in order to enhance system performance, impaired by fading and intersymbol interference, diversity reception in combination with a novel non-linear equalizer has been proposed. For typical in-building environments it is seen that space diversity may improve performance up to 5 dB at BER 10/sup -3/. However, for strong multipath components non-linear intersymbol interference is the predominant disturbance and performance can only be enhanced by the non-linear equalizer. These considerations can be easily extended to more complex channel models, although system performance can only be evaluated by computer simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 IEEE GLOBECOM.

Using a convolutional code with soft-decision Viterbi decoding for error correction, there are two methods for realizing the simultaneous error detection capability which characterizes hybrid-ARQ error control: (1) a two code approach which pre-encodes the information based on a high rate CRC code and performs error detection on the output of the Viterbi decoder, (2) a single code approach which modifies the Viterbi decoder to reject packets with low reliability during the Viterbi decoding process. The resulting analysis shows that the two code method is more robust than single code method with the most significant performance advantages realized for Rayleigh fading. The two code approach provides acceptable error rate performance and offers a throughput characteristic which is not as sensitive to changes in the average SNR as the single code approach. Since the implementational complexity of the two methods is comparable, the two code method is the preferred implementation for hybrid-ARQ on flat fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/CTMC.1994.512588","publicationTitle":"1994 IEEE GLOBECOM.

A maximum generalized likelihood detector (MGLD) that achieves optimum values of group near-far resistance (the worst-case asymptotic efficiency over the unknown signal amplitudes) is obtained. Unfortunately, the MGLD is practically unimplementable because, for M-ary signalling, it has a time complexity per symbol (TCS) of O(M/sup SN//SN), N being the packet length. A group sequence detector (GSD) is proposed as an alternative, and it consists of a bank of K matched filters for a front-end, followed by a cascade of a K-input S-output group decorrelating filter and a multiuser variant of the Viterbi algorithm with a TCS of O(M/sup S//S). The high SNR performance of the GSD is characterized through its asymptotic multiuser efficiency and the conditions under which the GSD closely tracks the performance of the MGLD are discussed. When S=1, the GSD reduces to the decorrelating detector with optimum near-far resistance, and when S=K, the GSD coincides with the maximum likelihood sequence detector with optimum asymptotic efficiency. A parallel bank of GSDs can also be used, one for detecting users in each group of a partition of all users to be detected, thereby providing the designer the flexibility of trading performance for reduced implementational complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Group sequence detection for the asynchronous Gaussian code-division multiple-access channel","publicationTitle":"1994 IEEE GLOBECOM.

High complexity of the optimal detector motivates the use of a decorrelating detector, whose performance is significantly improved through diversity.

Several techniques are employed to achieve compact test sets. Heuristics developed for stuck-at faults are shown to be effective in this context. The techniques especially designed for bridging faults are based on the observation that the yet-undetected faults can be represented using sets of lines and that a minimum test set size is obtained if the line sets representing yet-undetected faults are halved with every additional test vector. Logic blocks called bit-adders allow the partitioning of the line sets using a test generator for stuck-at faults, without having to determine in advance how the lines in a given set will be divided. Thus partitioning can be performed in a cost effective way for any line set size. Experimental results show that the test sets generated by the proposed procedure are smaller than those obtained by previously proposed procedures.","doi":"10.1109/VTEST.1995.512654","startPage":"310","endPage":"316","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 13th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/3889/11315/00512654.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 13th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTEST.1995.512654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact test generation for bridging faults under I/sub DDQ/ testing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Fault detection","Bridge circuits","Circuit testing","Switches","Current supplies","Logic","Feedback circuits","Test pattern generators","Fault diagnosis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS logic circuits","integrated circuit testing","logic testing","fault location","logic partitioning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact test generation","bridging faults","I/sub DDQ/ testing","stuck-at faults","bit-adders","partitioning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/512654/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Apr-3 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Compact test generation for bridging faults under I/sub DDQ/ testing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"30 April-3 May 1995","accessionNumber":"5153476","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact test generation for bridging faults under I/sub DDQ/ testing","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00512654.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055316S","chronDate":"30 Apr-3 May 1995","isNumber":"11315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3889","citationCount":"19","articleId":"512654","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":512684,"authors":[{"name":"A.D.

The interference caused by the overlap in the frequency responses of the signaling filters is calculated analytically and simulation results are given to support the theoretical calculations. It is shown that without any pre-receiver processing, the level of interchannel interference is lower in the cosine-modulated family of filters, because of their higher stopband attenuation. We also examine how pre-receiver processing (short equalizer plus cyclic prefix) can lower the level of interference, especially in the DFT system. Finally the capacity of a sample channel, similar to the twisted-pair channel of a subscriber loop, is calculated with and without the effect of interference taken into consideration.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1994.512684","publicationTitle":"1994 IEEE GLOBECOM.

The FAWAC (fixed assignment based window access with capture) scheme is an extension of the FAWA scheme. It is possible to have priorities on transmissions in assigned slots due to capture effect derived by power control.

The performance of FEC schemes has been investigated thoroughly in a number of studies, particularly in the context of ATM networks. The present author observes that if FEC is used in an ATM network environment for loss protection, then it may also be used simultaneously to reduce the probability that a cell is delayed excessively due to prevailing traffic conditions. This additional feature can be useful in time-critical applications, such as real-time data delivery, packet video, or synchronized multimedia object presentations, where there are time-deadlines to be met. Cells that fail to arrive at an end-system by the required deadline are treated as \"virtual\" erasures and reconstructed using FEC as if they had been lost. The effectiveness of FEC in reconstructing late cells is evaluated by simulating an ATM cell multiplexer with input streams consisting of variable bit rate packet video, fixed rate packet video, and background time-insensitive bursty data traffic. The FEC mechanism is found to be useful in reducing delay jitter and the probability of late cell arrival. It is also found to be useful in the combined purpose of reducing late cells and lost cells.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1994.512848","publicationTitle":"1994 IEEE GLOBECOM.

We show that the associated iterative decoder can be formulated in a simpler fashion by passing information from one decoder to the next using log-likelihood ratios as opposed to channel values that need to be normalized. Also no heuristically determined correction parameters are necessary for stable decoding. In addition, we can reduce the average number of iterations needed for the same BER performance by determining when further iterations achieve no more benefit. Furthermore, it seems that the trellis-termination problem appears non-trivial and we give a pragmatic suboptimal solution. We investigate different block sizes and also a hybrid scheme that performs extremely well with less computations. A drawback of the codes has been discovered: the BER curves show a flattening at higher signal-to-noise ratios, this is due to the small minimum distance of the whole code. By analyzing the interleaver used in the encoder we can calculate approximations to the BER at high SNRs. Finally, by careful interleaver manipulation the minimum distance of the code can be increased and the error-coefficient for the remaining small distance events can be further reduced. Furthermore, we have investigated the influence of the interleaver length on the SNR needed to achieve a certain BER. Simulations confirm both the analytical approximation to the BER as well as the method for interleaver design which yields a marked improvement at higher SNR.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/512991/","conferenceDate":"28 Nov.-2 Dec. 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"28 Nov- 2 Dec 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"5079852","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Illuminating the structure of code and decoder of parallel concatenated recursive systematic (turbo) codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Illuminating the structure of code and decoder of parallel concatenated recursive systematic (turbo) codes","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00512991.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027855S","chronDate":"28 Nov- 2 Dec 1994","isNumber":"11302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3878","citationCount":"166","articleId":"512991","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":512996,"authors":[{"name":"Guanghan Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Guanghan Xu","id":"37087144049"},{"name":"San-Qi Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"lastName":"San-Qi Li","id":"37087145710"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1820-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"512996","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":34,"totalDownloads":81},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=512996","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Wireless LAN","Multiaccess communication","Access protocols","Radio frequency","Bandwidth","Resource management","Wireless communication","Local area networks","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless LAN","multimedia communication","multi-access systems","access protocols","diversity reception","array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["throughput multiplication","wireless LAN","multimedia services","SDMA protocol design","radio-frequency bandwidth allocation","array signal processing","wireless access","local area networks","throughput","communication delays","wireless network","space division multiple access protocol","SDMA protocol","spatial diversity","terminals","frequency band","time slot","multiple antennas array","base station","signal processing software","received data","experimental studies"]}],"abstract":"Since the radio-frequency (RF) bandwidth allocated for wireless communications is a diminishing resource, wireless access to local area networks (LANs) has fundamental limitation on throughput and communication delays. With exponentially growing demand for multimedia services, this limitation becomes a bottleneck for expanding the wireless network capabilities. We exploit another resource, i.e., space, and design a new space division multiple access (SDMA) protocol to achieve throughput multiplication. The basic idea behind the SDMA protocol is that it exploits spatial diversity among different terminals to selectively transmit and receive signals in the same time slot and same frequency band. The only new requirements of this new protocol are an array of multiple antennas installed at a base station and advanced signal processing software to process the received data.

In particular, the telecommunication standard bodies are mainly considering, for the specification of clocks, five frequency stability quantities: Allan (1991) variance, modified Allan variance, time variance, root mean square of the time interval error and maximum time interval error. The influence of time error measurement sampling period on the behaviour of these quantities is analyzed. Computer simulation and experimental measurement results are reported. With the aim of providing useful information for specification design.

However their envelope fluctuations result, after nonlinear amplification, in out-of-band emissions thus adjacent channel interferences. A solution is to linearize the power amplifier. We present an analog linearization loop based an an improved cartesian feedback method. Its performance is at least as good as those of designs of similar complexity and it offers a great robustness against variation of components characteristics encountered in large volume production. This paper also presents details on a nonlinear amplifier model which was essential for this study. Both AM-AM and AM-PM characteristics are considered. Tests conducted on hardware confirmed the validity of this modelling. A simulation was built to determine the spurious power seen by a receiver tuned to an adjacent channel.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/513018/","accessionNumber":"5079879","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 Nov.-2 Dec. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Linearization of power amplifiers modelling and simulations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linearization of power amplifiers modelling and simulations","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00513018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040774S","chronDate":"0-0  0","isNumber":"11302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3878","citationCount":"6","articleId":"513018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":513019,"authors":[{"name":"P.

To combat the well-known inefficiency of Monte-Carlo simulations of complex multi-user CDMA systems, importance sampling methods have already been applied and shown to be very efficient, but they were subject to quite restrictive assumptions or to a greatly simplified simulation setup. We investigate the application to systems with memory in conjunction with improved importance sampling. Two approaches are analyzed depending on the knowledge of the probability density function of the noise at the output of the system, namely the input version and the output version. The application shows that, when both methods can be applied, the output version is to be prefered in terms of greatest sample savings (about 4 orders of magnitude at a signal to noise ratio of 10 dB).","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1994.513019","publicationTitle":"1994 IEEE GLOBECOM.

Although a typical sag is only 5 to 20 cycles, electronic equipment may fail or \"trip\". A trip of industrial process equipment, such as a motor drive or programmable logic controller, may be extremely costly. Methods to improve the \"ride-through\" capability of the equipment usually is a system solution: uninterruptable power supplies, motor-generator sets, etc. Often, only a few of the devices in an industrial process are very sensitive to sags. Therefore, a better solution is to desensitize the components which are affected by sags. Compared to AC variable frequency drives, DC motor drives are particularly susceptible to sags because they inherently lack electrical energy storage devices. The addition of capacitance on the DC-side of the drive will not improve ride-through and can be detrimental to controllability. Examples of DC drive response during sags are shown and methods for de-sensitizing DC motor drives for sag-related problems are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/SECON.1995.513056","startPage":"52","endPage":"58","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE Southeastcon '95.

Algorithms used for decoding must be able to find the error locations, and for nonbinary codes, the error magnitudes. One of the most efficient algorithms for decoding BCH codes is Berlekamp's algorithm. To find the error locations the algorithm must solve a set of t equations in t unknowns. This paper explores, for binary BCH codes, a new method that uses half of the unknowns to determine the other unknowns, thus solving t/2 equations in t/2 unknowns. However, because of the reduced number of equations, the algorithm only iterates half the number of times. The performance of the new algorithm is shown to be superior to both Berlekamp's algorithm and a simplified algorithm in terms of execution times, which includes the field multiplications and additions and required memory.","doi":"10.1109/SECON.1995.513059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.1995.513059","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE Southeastcon '95.

State-of-the-art systems are capable of recognizing tens of thousands of words in complex domains such as newspaper correspondence and travel planning. A major part of this success is due to advances in language modeling and search techniques that support efficient, sub-optimal decoding over large search spaces. The benefit from focusing a recognition system on a particular domain has motivated a steady progression from static language models towards more adaptive models that consist of mixtures of bigrams, trigrams and long-distance n-grams. Similarly, the availability of multiple sources of information about the correct word hypothesis has led to the advent of efficient multi-pass search strategies. The result is a powerful pattern-matching paradigm that has applications to a wide range of signal detection problems. Future research in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition will be directed towards developing more efficient means of dynamically integrating such information.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE Southeastcon '95.

Consider a cylindrical microstrip line cross-sectional configuration consisting of two concentric cylindrical dielectric substrates. Two arbitrary number C/sub 1/ and C/sub 2/ of infinitesimally thin arc strips of the arbitrary size (/spl alpha//sub 1//spl les/S/sub 1//spl les//spl beta//sub 1/) and (/spl alpha//sub 2//spl les/S/sub 2//spl les//spl beta//sub 2/) are clad on the dielectric cylindrical interfaces. The dielectric cylinders are characterized by real scalar permittivity /spl epsiv//sub i/ and permeability /spl mu//sub 0/ while the region outside of the dielectric cylinders is free space providing constitutive parameters /spl epsiv//sub 0/ and /spl mu//sub 0/, respectively. The two conductors are charged by V/sub 1/ and V/sub 2/ while the C/sub 0/ is grounded. The analysis is based on finite and infinite element methods and the quasi-static TEM mode approximation. The quasistatic TEM is essentially a low frequency model of a microstrip line that can be concerned with the existence of electric and magnetic fields separately. The microstrip line system is analyzed with both the ordinary finite to discretize the /spl Omega//sub i/ bounded region and global exterior infinite element to cover the /spl Omega//sub 0/ unbounded domain. The potential and field distribution in the cross section of the microstrip line are determined by minimizing the energy functional of the Laplace's equation using the variational principle. Then it can be used to calculate the Maxwellian capacitance or inductance matrix per unit length of the microstrip line. The parameters of the microstrip line can be determined in terms of the capacitance or inductance matrix. The equivalent circuit for the coupled microstrip lines is developed and its application to the solution of wave propagation modes is demonstrated. In this investigation, the accurate solution of characteristic impedance, effective dielectric constant, attenuation, coupling, propagation constant, and so on has been analyzed in terms of the capacitance matrix. These parameters are important in the design of microstrip lines, strip lines, and transmission lines.","doi":"10.1109/SECON.1995.513100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.1995.513100","startPage":"269","endPage":"273","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE Southeastcon '95.

In the proposed method, which uses the time division duplex (TDD) mode of transmission, a mobile receiver can measure changes of the propagation delay. It then accordingly adjusts its transmission time so its signal can arrive at base station synchronously with other mobile units. A simple control unit is used at the mobile unit in order to reduce any error due to changes in propagation delay. The system operates as follows. At the start of a call, a mobile unit is quasi-synchronised through feedback control from the base station. The mobile unit then maintains synchronous status without any further base station feedback. The degree of the quasi-synchronous accuracy is determined by a clock in mobile units. This paper shows performance results based on using a clock rate of ten times faster than the spreading rate. Orthogonal codes are used for spreading the signals. These results demonstrate that the reverse link CDMA multiuser interference is to a great degree removed.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1994.513153","publicationTitle":"1994 IEEE GLOBECOM.

In what follows a survey of the various applications of these multiport networks is presented. Furthermore, the possibility of increasing the operation flexibility suggested the use of specific components able to carry out a close control of the phase. With regard to this fact, innovating types of phase-shifters, providing a very accurate slope equalization of the phase over a specified frequency band, were developed. All designs were performed using CAD Libra (software by Eesof) to operate over the 1.7-1.9 GHz band and prototypes were manufactured on Rogers RT6006 and RT5880 Duroid substrates. Finally, the microstrip technology used for DCS applications at 1.8 GHz can easily be transferred to satellite mobile systems at 1.6 GHz and to cellular based PCN (2-2.5 GHz band).","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1994.513168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11302","startPage":"1717","endPage":"1721 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 IEEE GLOBECOM.

Usually, the reliability measures are functions of component failure rates and fault coverage probabilities. Coverage provides information about the fault and error detection, isolation and system recovery capabilities. This parameter can be estimated by physical or simulated fault injection. One of the most difficult problems the analyst has to deal with, throughout the fault injection process, is the largeness of the fault space. This paper addresses the problem of inferring the coverage probabilities from the information gathered in physical or simulated fault injection experiments. A 3-stage sampling technique is developed for coping with the largeness of the fault space. Statistical experiments are carried out in a three-dimensional fault space which takes into account the inputs applied to the system, fault occurrence times and fault locations.","doi":"10.1109/RAMS.1995.513236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAMS.1995.513236","startPage":"132","endPage":"136","displayPublicationTitle":"Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium 1995 Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel3/3884/11310/00513236.pdf","publicationTitle":"Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium 1995 Proceedings","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of the coverage probabilities by 3-stage sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Jan 1995","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of the coverage probabilities by 3-stage sampling","conferenceDate":"16-19 Jan. 1995","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4973830","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/513236/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of the coverage probabilities by 3-stage sampling","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00513236.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041241S","chronDate":"16-19 Jan 1995","isNumber":"11310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3884","citationCount":"2","articleId":"513236","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":513269,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The procedure uses component failure rates and the financial impact to calculate annual risk premiums, which approximate the insurance premiums required to compensate for financial losses caused by the component failures. Basic reliability calculations are then used to combine the component characteristics and to find the annual risk premium of the system. Typically the annual risk premiums for components follow a Pareto distribution; i.e., several component failures account for most of the production losses. Results of these calculations provide data for: ranking component failures on the basis of financial impact across discipline, system, and unit boundaries; developing realistic estimates of the future availability of units and systems; developing alternatives for upgrading systems to achieve desired availability; and developing maintenance strategies.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Risk analysis","Industrial economics","Availability","Failure analysis","Hardware","Maintenance","Economic forecasting","Insurance","Safety","Risk management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["industries","production","economics","reliability","maintenance engineering","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliability","economic risk","process industries","maintainability","component failure rates","financial impact","annual risk premiums","Pareto distribution","production losses","ranking","availability","maintenance strategies"]}],"doi":"10.1109/RAMS.1995.513269","publicationTitle":"Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium 1995 Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium 1995 Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel3/3884/11310/00513269.pdf","startPage":"356","endPage":"361","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAMS.1995.513269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using R&M analysis to calculate economic risk in the process industries","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=513269","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Using R&M analysis to calculate economic risk in the process industries","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/513269/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"4973864","conferenceDate":"16-19 Jan. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Jan 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using R&M analysis to calculate economic risk in the process industries","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00513269.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028688S","chronDate":"16-19 Jan 1995","isNumber":"11310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3884","citationCount":"4","articleId":"513269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":513297,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Personal and mobile digital communications applications will have to cope with harsh propagation conditions, characterised by multipath and fading phenomena. Spread spectrum techniques possess intrinsic protection against such frequency-selective channels, but, when the system is loaded, additional multipath processing is required at the receiver side to guarantee good performance. An accurate knowledge of the channel parameters is needed to perform multipath processing. In the paper a novel family of maximum likelihood channel estimators for S-CDM systems is derived. Estimators performance, evaluated and optimised for the Gold code family, shows a good robustness also for large carrier frequency offsets.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1994.513314","publicationTitle":"1994 IEEE GLOBECOM.

Primarily considered for the noteworthy features of low power flux density emission and robustness to interference and multipath, CDMA is known to provide reduced bandwidth and power efficiency when compared to traditional TDMA and FDMA due to the intrinsic co-channel self-noise. Practical solutions, under advanced development status in Europe and in the USA, respectively, propose to overcome such a shortcoming by implementing orthogonal CDMA signalling in the outbound link. The paper is focused on the comparative performance analysis of those two orthogonal CDMA schemes in the operating conditions of a mobile satellite communications system. In particular, starting from the analysis of the classical additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) environment, the two CDMA systems are compared in the presence of carrier phase offset, frequency-selective multipath fading, and a typical satellite transponder nonlinearity.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1994.513316","publicationTitle":"1994 IEEE GLOBECOM.

The switch is structured around an input/output buffering switch architecture, high-speed bipolar devices and multichip module technology. The switch adopts a bufferless crossbar network realized with high-speed bipolar devices and cell buffers only on each input and output line. Using a separate architecture to link the bufferless routing network to the cell buffers, 20 Gb/s high-speed cell transmission can be easily realized in the crossbar network. In addition, a new high-speed arbitration algorithm using three bus lines on each output line, named the bi-directional arbiter, is adopted. The bi-directional arbiter is about 1.5 times faster than the conventional ring-arbiter and has the same fairness function. Using the switching system, a sub-tera-bit/s ATM switching system can be achieved in a significant step towards broadband ISDN.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28 Nov- 2 Dec 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/513394/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5079719","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"28 Nov.-2 Dec. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A 160-Gb/s ATM switching system using an internal speed-up crossbar switch","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 160-Gb/s ATM switching system using an internal speed-up crossbar switch","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00513394.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034826S","chronDate":"28 Nov- 2 Dec 1994","isNumber":"11300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3878","citationCount":"31","articleId":"513394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":513414,"authors":[{"name":"G.

However, these techniques often assume knowledge of system parameters, suck as signature waveforms for all users, and associated timing, which may not be available, or may be inconvenient to obtain in practice. Recently proposed adaptive minimum mean squared error (MMSE) detectors do not require knowledge of signature waveforms; however, these techniques require a training sequence for adaptation. Here we propose a blind multiuser linear detector which requires only knowledge of the desired user's signature sequence (and associated timing). In particular, it does not require the use of a training sequence. Our approach is to decompose the filter impulse response into the sum of two orthogonal components: the matched filter corresponding to the desired user plus an adaptive filter. We show that if the adaptive filter is chosen to minimize the energy (i.e., variance) of output samples at each symbol interval, then a scaled version of the MMSE detector is obtained. Based on this observation, a simple adaptive gradient algorithm is derived, and numerical examples are presented which illustrate its performance in a synchronous CDMA system.","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 IEEE GLOBECOM.

The scheme is a combination of orthogonalizing matched-filter (OMF) and coherent detection with predictive carrier recovery. OMF is a matched filter with an adaptive interference canceller. The interference canceller operates by orthogonalizing the mutual correlation between the codes used in systems. The operation adaptively controls its orthogonalization parameters using only the received signal. The criterion for adaptation is minimizing the average output power subject to a constraint coefficient condition. The algorithm for this criterion is a blind one that does not require any reference signal nor any detected signal, and there is no error propagation. Computer simulations show that OMF is effective in increasing the capacity of DS-CDMA mobile communication systems.

The transmitted data bits are serial to parallel converted to a number of parallel branches. Each bit on each branch is DS-SS modulated and transmitted with a number of orthogonal and overlapping carriers. Given that sufficient interleaving is provided, this procedure provides many advantages. The system performance is compared to that of the conventional RAKE receiver. It is shown that the multi-carrier system over-performs the RAKE receiver when the system parameters are selected properly. The system utilizes a small number of carriers to solve the intersymbol interference (ISI). The data on each carrier is spread by a lower rate PN code. This reduces the effect of inter-chip interference (ICI). This technique is shown to provide the following advantages: the spread spectrum processing gain is increased, the effect of multipath interference is removed, and frequency/time diversity is achieved.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1994.513550","publicationTitle":"1994 IEEE GLOBECOM.

This paper is an attempt to provide that analysis and performance comparison. It presents statistical characterizations of several digitally implemented, uniformly sampled, first-order PLLs for QAM modulation. Since a majority of the phase detectors used in QAM modulation are discrete time (e.g., decision directed) in nature, the digital PLL (DPLL) is the natural implementation of these carrier synchronization loops. The first-order DPLL when the modulation is an i.i.d. random sequence and when operating in the additive white Gaussian noise channel (AWGN) produces a phase estimate that is a discrete time first-order Markov process, and the many tools for Markov analysis can be brought to bear on the performance analysis.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1994.513554","publicationTitle":"1994 IEEE GLOBECOM.

This process identifies several key areas where improved knowledge and capability are needed in the overall build-in reliability process: improve the circuit modeling of wearout phenomena; develop new gate dielectrics to increase performance while maintaining reliability; determine if there is a discontinuity caused by entering the direct tunneling regime of gate oxide operation; increase understanding of thermal limitations on interconnect design guidelines in multilevel metal systems; and enhance emerging methodologies for ESD/EOS build-in reliability.","doi":"10.1109/RELPHY.1995.513645","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/3893/11322/00513645.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RELPHY.1995.513645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11322","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trends for deep submicron VLSI and their implications for reliability","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=513645","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Trends for deep submicron VLSI and their implications for reliability","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 April 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/513645/","conferenceDate":"4-6 April 1995","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5153061","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trends for deep submicron VLSI and their implications for reliability","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"00513645.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077422S","chronDate":"4-6 April 1995","isNumber":"11322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3893","citationCount":"26","articleId":"513645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":513662,"authors":[{"name":"W.A.

Such a representation can be applied to image coding and to increase image resolution. One of the main drawbacks of conventional fractal representation is the fact that the mappings are between blocks. As a result, the reconstructed image may suffer from disturbing blockiness. In this work we present a method for mapping similar regions within an image in the wavelet domain. We first show how to use the Haar wavelet transform coefficients to find mappings which are identical to conventional blockwise mappings. The union of these mappings, between sets of wavelet coefficients, can be interpreted as a prediction of higher bands of a signal from its lower band. Changing the mother-wavelet to other than Haar, creates mappings which are between regions which smoothly decay towards their borders, thus reducing the blockiness, as well as improving the PSNR of the reconstructed image.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fractal representation of images via the discrete wavelet transform","publicationTitle":"Eighteenth Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","doi":"10.1109/EEIS.1995.513796","displayPublicationTitle":"Eighteenth Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfPath":"/iel3/3899/11328/00513796.pdf","startPage":"2.2.2/1","endPage":"2.2.2/5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEIS.1995.513796","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11328","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=513796","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/513796/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 March 1995","displayDocTitle":"Fractal representation of images via the discrete wavelet transform","conferenceDate":"7-8 March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5176502","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fractal representation of images via the discrete wavelet transform","confLoc":"Tel Aviv, Israel","sourcePdf":"00513796.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048474S","chronDate":"7-8 March 1995","isNumber":"11328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3899","citationCount":"19","articleId":"513796","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":513839,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Carrier mobility is one of the most important parameters required to accurately predict MOSFET terminal characteristics. Numerous models for carrier mobility for both the inversion layer and bulk silicon have been reported in the literature. Several choices are usually available with regard to the selection of mobility models in device simulators. This study presents a comparative and detailed examination of the various inversion layer and bulk mobility models that reside in popular device simulators. MOSFET I-V characteristics have been simulated and compared with the experimental data of 10 different sets of MOS devices fabricated with different processes. The device data, obtained from different industrial and university sources, include both NMOS and PMOS devices, and both LDD and non-LDD devices with effective channel lengths varying from 0.22 /spl mu/m to 9.1 /spl mu/m. About 1800 PISCES simulations have been performed to complete this study, in which the maximum percentage difference and the rms error value between the experimental and simulated drain current have been used as the comparison criteria. It has been observed that among the selected inversion layer drift-diffusion models, the University of Texas at Austin effective-field based local-field dependent models for both electrons and holes provided consistently better agreement over the wide range of experimental data.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Eleventh Biennial University/Government/ Industry Microelectronics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/3917/11347/00514142.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"192","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Eleventh Biennial University/Government/ Industry Microelectronics Symposium","doi":"10.1109/UGIM.1995.514142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UGIM.1995.514142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11347","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=514142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detailed evaluation of different inversion layer electron and hole mobility models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Charge carrier processes","Electron mobility","MOS devices","Silicon","MOSFET circuits","Integrated circuit technology","Predictive models","Microelectronics","Virtual manufacturing","MOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hole mobility","electron mobility","semiconductor device models","inversion layers","MOSFET"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electron mobility","hole mobility","carrier mobility models","submicron device phenomena","device simulators","MOSFET terminal characteristics","inversion layer mobility models","bulk mobility models","MOSFET I-V characteristics","NMOS devices","PMOS devices","LDD devices","nonLDD devices","PISCES simulations","drain current","drift-diffusion models","effective-field based local-field dependent models","lightly-doped drain devices","0.22 to 9.1 micron"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/514142/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Detailed evaluation of different inversion layer electron and hole mobility models","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5188756","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-17 May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detailed evaluation of different inversion layer electron and hole mobility models","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00514142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040728S","chronDate":"16-17 May 1995","isNumber":"11347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3917","citationCount":"3","articleId":"514142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":514159,"authors":[{"name":"N.

To increase throughput and to lower costs, we have developed a new approach to flip-chip assembly with ACAs. Our process uses two unique features: an ACA thixotropic paste formulation and a batch curing fixture. The thixotropic paste, which replaces the more conventional film form of the adhesive, can be easily dispensed onto the substrate with a stencil printer. Chips placed into the ACA paste are held securely due to the \"tacky\" nature of the material much like surface mount components are held by solder pastes. As a result, no heating of the chips is required during assembly, increasing throughput and relaxing co-planarity tolerances in the alignment equipment. As with all ACAs, the paste must be cured by the simultaneous application of heat and pressure. In our process, curing is accomplished in a fixture capable of holding multiple chips and/or circuit boards simultaneously. Uniform pressure is applied to components during the 3-5 minute thermal cure cycle via a conformable silicone rubber bladder. Initial yield and temperature cycling data are reported in this paper. Silicon chips with gold metallization show small (<15%) increases in contact resistance after more than 1000 test cycles (between 0-100/spl deg/C); bumping the chips was not required. Aluminum metallized chips proved to be unreliable after temperature cycling tests.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11336","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.1995.514369","publicationTitle":"1995 Proceedings. 45th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 Proceedings. 45th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/3906/11336/00514369.pdf","startPage":"107","endPage":"113","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.1995.514369","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach to using anisotropically conductive adhesives for flip chip assembly","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"A new approach to using anisotropically conductive adhesives for flip chip assembly","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 May 1995","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5161572","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/514369/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach to using anisotropically conductive adhesives for flip chip assembly","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"00514369.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054732S","chronDate":"21-24 May 1995","isNumber":"11336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3906","citationCount":"5","articleId":"514369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":514388,"authors":[{"name":"Ki-Bon Cha","affiliation":["Package Research and Development Center, LG Semicon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ki-Bon Cha","id":"37087298068"},{"name":"Young-Gon Kim","affiliation":["Package Research and Development Center, LG Semicon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Young-Gon Kim","id":"37087145596"},{"name":"Teck-Kyu Kang","affiliation":["Package Research and Development Center, LG Semicon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Teck-Kyu Kang","id":"37087704771"},{"name":"Dae-Soon Kang","affiliation":["Package Research and Development Center, LG Semicon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dae-Soon Kang","id":"37087701645"},{"name":"Sung-Dae Baek","affiliation":["Package Research and Development Center, LG Semicon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sung-Dae Baek","id":"37087701084"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2736-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"514388","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":54},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Plastic packaging","Testing","Geometry","Shape","Surface resistance","Research and development","Manufacturing","Mass production","Inspection","Microelectronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["plastic packaging","integrated circuit packaging","integrated circuit reliability","reflow soldering","encapsulation","lead bonding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultra-thin crack-free bottom leaded plastic package","bottom leaded plastic package design","manufacturability","reliability","mass production","encapsulated chip","lead frame geometry","package bottom pad locations","infrared reflow test resistance","visual inspection","ultrasonic inspection","cross-sectional examinations","crack resistance test","0.82 mm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=514388","abstract":"An ultra-thin, crack-free, and bottom leaded package (BLP) has been developed. Its manufacturability and reliability have been tested for mass production purposes. The design advantage of size comes from the removal of the outer leads from the conventional lead frame configuration. Therefore, the encapsulated chip conducts electrical signals through the bottom side of the package. With the help of the this new design concept, the thickness of the package has been reduced to as little as 0.82 mm. Since the outer leads do not occupy any mounting board, the projected area of the package on the board is only 65% of conventional thin packages, such as thin-small-outline packages (TSOP). The high reliability of the package comes from the lead frame geometry and the package bottom pad locations. The reliability has been tested by the resistance to infrared (IR) reflow test conditions.

Wavelet transform provides local information and multiresolution decomposition on a signal that cannot be obtained using traditional methods such as Fourier transforms and statistical estimation theory. Hence the change in complex biological signals can be detected. We use wavelet analysis as an innovative method for identifying and characterizing chaotic biological signals in this paper. We usually do not know the underlying mechanism that determine the behavior of a biosystem. We are instead presented with nothing more than a phenomenological time series signal of the behavior, and must infer the mechanism from simple measurements of that time series. Data we used are simulated chaotic signals from the logistic equation. Using wavelet transformation we extract instantaneous frequencies of the signal varying in time across scales. The results under different parameters and initial conditions show that the phase maps of their wavelet transforms are different between period doubling bifurcation and chaos. This information could be used as a diagnostic for detecting different nonlinear dynamic responses. This may lead to a better understanding of the system, that may allow us to predict the onset of lethal arrhythmias and to intervene prior to the development of catastrophic clinical events.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1995 Fourteenth Southern Biomedical Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/3897/11326/00514474.pdf","startPage":"185","endPage":"188","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1995 Fourteenth Southern Biomedical Engineering Conference","doi":"10.1109/SBEC.1995.514474","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBEC.1995.514474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11326","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=514474","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet transformation of chaotic biological signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Wavelet analysis","Signal analysis","Frequency","Fourier transforms","Wavelet transforms","Biology computing","Signal resolution","Estimation theory","Signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrocardiography","electroencephalography","magnetoencephalography","patient diagnosis","wavelet transforms","medical signal processing","time series","chaos"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transformation","chaotic biological signals","wavelet analysis","mathematical theory","computational method","nonstationary signal","localization properties","time","frequency","hierarchical structures","local information","multiresolution decomposition","phenomenological time series signal","logistic equation","instantaneous frequencies","phase maps","period doubling bifurcation","nonlinear dynamic responses","lethal arrhythmias","catastrophic clinical events","ECG","EEG","MEG"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/514474/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Apr 1995","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet transformation of chaotic biological signals","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5125019","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-9 April 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet transformation of chaotic biological signals","confLoc":"Shreveport, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00514474.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040828S","chronDate":"7-9 Apr 1995","isNumber":"11326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3897","citationCount":"2","articleId":"514474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":514516,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Ming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chi-Ming Chen","id":"37087195905"},{"name":"Jar-Ferr Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jar-Ferr Yang","id":"37086982541"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2440-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"514516","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Nonlinear filters","Signal processing algorithms","Neural network hardware","Filtering algorithms","Circuits","Switches","Algorithm design and analysis","Image recognition","Speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","filtering theory","iterative methods","convergence of numerical methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["order filtering neural network","two-layer structure","hardware complexity","convergence speed","iteration"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=514516","abstract":"In this paper, a new order filtering neural network, which can select a specific ordered value from all inputs, is developed and analyzed.

Based on the same rationale as the CSMA/CD protocol, this protocol is designed to avoid collision or congestion of traffic before formal transmission of a packet. By the handshake procedure, the intended transmitter is able to test the channel quality and the receiver's status using a very short handshake packet. Therefore, channel traffic can be controlled to avoid overload. The throughput and reliability are analyzed based on the underlying Markovian models. Numerical results are compared to other error control schemes and show that with a reasonably short handshake time compared to the packet transmission time, this handshake protocol with simple forward error correction offers an excellent alternative for error control and can even improve the throughput performance.","doi":"10.1109/APCCAS.1994.514521","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of APCCAS'94 - 1994 Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of APCCAS'94 - 1994 Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/3867/11285/00514521.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCCAS.1994.514521","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11285","startPage":"39","endPage":"44","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A handshake protocol for CDMA wireless LANs with error control capabilities","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=514521","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A handshake protocol for CDMA wireless LANs with error control capabilities","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Dec 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/514521/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Dec. 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5152748","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A handshake protocol for CDMA wireless LANs with error control capabilities","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00514521.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051644S","chronDate":"5-8 Dec 1994","isNumber":"11285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3867","citationCount":"3","articleId":"514521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":514527,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Liang Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chin-Liang Wang","id":"37068528500"},{"name":"Chang-Yu Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chang-Yu Chen","id":"37351230000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2440-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"514527","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Systolic arrays","Discrete cosine transforms","Discrete transforms","CMOS technology","Two dimensional displays","Matrix decomposition","Very large scale integration","Throughput","Circuit synthesis","Design automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS logic circuits","systolic arrays","integrated circuit design","circuit layout CAD","discrete cosine transforms","Hartley transforms","digital arithmetic","matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear systolic array","2D discrete cosine transform","row-column decomposition","modular architecture","VLSI implementation","throughput","area-time complexity","discrete sinusoidal transforms","discrete sine transform","discrete Hartley transform","GENESIL CAD tool","CMOS technology","die size","clock rate","silicon compiler tool","0.8 mum","33 MHz"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a linear systolic array of N basic cells (including 2N multipliers) for computing the two-dimensional (2-D) N/spl times/N-point discrete cosine transform (DCT). The array is based on the row-column decomposition but involves no matrix transposition problems. The proposed architecture is highly regular, modular, and thus very suitable for VLSI implementation. Also, it has an efficiency of 100 percent and a throughput of one N/spl times/N-point transform per N/sup 2/ cycles. As compared to existing array structures for the 2-D DCT, the proposed one achieves lower or the same area-time complexity with better regularity. Without change in circuit design, it can be directly used to compute the 2-D N/spl times/N-point inverse DCT and other discrete sinusoidal transforms, such as the discrete sine transform and the discrete Hartley transform. By using the GENESIL CAD tool we design a prototype chip of the proposed linear array for the 8/spl times/8-point DCT in a 0.8 /spl mu/m CMOS technology. The chip requires a die size of about 6.95 mm/spl times/6.9 mm (including 108363 transistors) and is able to operate at a clock rate up to 33 MHz.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A linear systolic array for the 2-D discrete cosine transform","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of APCCAS'94 - 1994 Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/APCCAS.1994.514527","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of APCCAS'94 - 1994 Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/3867/11285/00514527.pdf","startPage":"73","endPage":"78","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCCAS.1994.514527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=514527","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/514527/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"A linear systolic array for the 2-D discrete cosine transform","conferenceDate":"5-8 Dec. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5152754","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A linear systolic array for the 2-D discrete cosine transform","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00514527.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059787S","chronDate":"5-8 Dec 1994","isNumber":"11285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3867","citationCount":"1","articleId":"514527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":514528,"authors":[{"name":"C.T.

It could consume as much as 75% of the total processing power of a video codec. Although various international video coding standards have adopted the block-matching approach for motion estimation, a designer can still have the freedom to choose a specific technique to find the motion vectors. Consequently, numerous techniques ranging from full search to simple fast search algorithms have been proposed and some of them have been implemented in VLSI chips. It should be emphasized that one of the most important requirements for an effective motion estimation algorithm is its ability to perform in real-time. The choice of a specific algorithm for implementation, however, depends very much on the intended application as well as the trade-offs between the desired performance and affordable complexity. In this paper, we first discuss what are the essential ingredients for an effective block-matching motion estimation, then briefly, describe what is the status of current technology, and finally, present some new activities in this vital area of research.","doi":"10.1109/APCCAS.1994.514606","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of APCCAS'94 - 1994 Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of APCCAS'94 - 1994 Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/3867/11285/00514606.pdf","startPage":"530","endPage":"531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCCAS.1994.514606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algorithms and VLSI implementation for block-matching motion estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/514606/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"Algorithms and VLSI implementation for block-matching motion estimation","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5160921","conferenceDate":"5-8 Dec. 1994","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algorithms and VLSI implementation for block-matching motion estimation","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00514606.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052654S","chronDate":"5-8 Dec 1994","isNumber":"11285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3867","citationCount":"1","articleId":"514606","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":514617,"authors":[{"name":"K.-H.

Then each line segment is traced in parallel, with a prioritisation scheme dealing with segment intersection and applying colinearity restrictions to avoid merging two segments of different slopes.

Documents contain both text and diagrams; data flow diagrams play a prominent role in software documents. Using current techniques, it is possible to recover the information in a data flow diagram by scanning the printed document and processing the data obtained. Feature extraction and syntax analysis enable the construction of a validated, formalized model of the data flow diagram. Understanding, however, requires a semantic interpretation. We describe a semantic model for data flow diagrams using general techniques that can be applied to other kinds of diagram. We argue that a semantic model is an essential component of a document understanding system; without a semantic model, it is difficult or impossible to extract useful information from a document.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2nd Working Conference on Reverse Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/3936/11405/00514690.pdf","startPage":"22","endPage":"29","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2nd Working Conference on Reverse Engineering","doi":"10.1109/WCRE.1995.514690","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCRE.1995.514690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11405","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=514690","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Retrieving information from data flow diagrams","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Information retrieval","Data mining","Reverse engineering","Documentation","Maintenance engineering","Computer science","Feature extraction","Programming","Design engineering","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flowcharting","reverse engineering","feature extraction","information retrieval","system documentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information retrieval","data flow diagrams","reverse engineering","document information extraction","routine digital storage","text","printed document scanning","feature extraction","syntax analysis","validated formalized model","program understanding","semantic interpretation","document understanding system","legacy systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/514690/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Jul 1995","displayDocTitle":"Retrieving information from data flow diagrams","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5044760","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-16 July 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Retrieving information from data flow diagrams","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00514690.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034303S","chronDate":"14-16 Jul 1995","isNumber":"11405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3936","citationCount":"15","articleId":"514690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":514697,"authors":[{"name":"B.S.

We suggest to use the cross-validation scheme combined with a resampling technique to obtain an estimate of the generalization performance distribution of a specific model. This enables the formulation of a bulk of new generalization performance measures. Numerical results demonstrate the viability of the approach compared to the standard technique of using algebraic estimates like the FPE. Moreover, we consider the problem of comparing the generalization performance of different competing models. Since all models are trained on the same data, a key issue is to take this dependency into account. The optimal split of the data set of size N into a cross-validation set of size N/spl gamma/ and a training set of size N(1-/spl gamma/) is discussed. Asymptotically (large data sees), /spl gamma//sub opt//spl rarr/1 such that a relatively larger amount is left for validation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Aug-2 Sep 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/514876/","accessionNumber":"5087355","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Empirical generalization assessment of neural network models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Empirical generalization assessment of neural network models","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00514876.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122483S","chronDate":"31 Aug-2 Sep 1995","isNumber":"11423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3947","citationCount":"12","articleId":"514876","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":514878,"authors":[{"name":"H.

DMD optimizes the whole metrics of discriminant functions with the minimum classification error/generalized probabilistic descent method (MCE/GPD) such that the intrinsic features of each pattern class can be represented efficiently. The resulting metrics lead accordingly to robust recognizers. DMD is quite general. Several existing methods, such as learning vector quantization, subspace method, discriminative feature extraction, radial-basis function network, and the continuous hidden Markov model, are defined as its special cases.

The simulation results demonstrate that such a neural oscillator may exhibit marked changes in its spatiotemporal pattern in response to changes in the oscillatory input. Under a strong entrainment condition, the network can differentiate small changes in the frequency of in-phase inputs by displaying profound changes in both the waveforms and relative phases of the neuronal activities. Similarly, changes in the phase relationship of the oscillatory inputs are manifested as significant changes in the amplitude of neuronal activities.

The forward training of an HMM, based on either the Baum-Welch reestimation or gradient method, finds the model parameters /spl lambda/ to optimize some criteria (e.g., maximum likelihood, maximum mutual information, and mean squared error) with given speech inputs s. On the other hand, the inversion of an HMM finds speech inputs s that optimize some criterion with given model parameters /spl lambda/. The performance of the proposed gradient based HMM inversion for noisy speech recognition under additive noise corruption and microphone mismatch conditions is compared with the robust Baum-Welch HMM inversion technique along with other noisy speech recognition technique, i.e., the robust MINIMAX classification technique.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/3947/11423/00514899.pdf","startPage":"253","endPage":"262","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/NNSP.1995.514899","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NNSP.1995.514899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11423","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=514899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From artificial neural network inversion to hidden Markov model inversion: application to robust speech recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Hidden Markov models","Speech recognition","Additive noise","Noise robustness","Gradient methods","Optimization methods","Mutual information","Microphones","Minimax techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition","neural nets","hidden Markov models","duality (mathematics)","optimisation","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network inversion","hidden Markov model inversion","gradient method","speech recognition","conceptual duality","forward training","Baum-Welch reestimation","optimization","additive noise corruption","MINIMAX classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/514899/","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Aug-2 Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"From artificial neural network inversion to hidden Markov model inversion: application to robust speech recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5093967","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From artificial neural network inversion to hidden Markov model inversion: application to robust speech recognition","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00514899.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031399S","chronDate":"31 Aug-2 Sep 1995","isNumber":"11423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3947","articleId":"514899","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":514906,"authors":[{"name":"S.Y.

The face recognition system consists of three modules. First, the face detector finds the location of a human face in an image. The eye localizer determines the positions of both eyes in order to generate meaningful feature vectors. The facial region proposed contains eyebrows, eyes, and nose, but excluding mouth. (Eye-glasses will be permissible.) Lastly, the third module is a face recognizer. The DBNN can be effectively applied to all the three modules. It adopts a hierarchical network structures with nonlinear basis functions and a competitive credit-assignment scheme. The paper demonstrates its successful application to face recognition applications on both the public (FERET) and in-house (SCR) databases. In terms of speed, given the extracted features, the training phase for 100-200 persons would take less than one hour on Sparc10. The whole recognition process (including eye localization, feature extraction, and classification using DBNN) may consume only a fraction of a second on Sparc10. Experiments on three different databases all demonstrated high recognition accuracies. A preliminary study also confirms that a similar DBNN recognizer can effectively recognize palms, which could potentially offer a much more reliable biometric feature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Aug-2 Sep 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/514906/","accessionNumber":"5087359","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A neural network approach to face/palm recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network approach to face/palm recognition","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00514906.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028854S","chronDate":"31 Aug-2 Sep 1995","isNumber":"11423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3947","citationCount":"21","articleId":"514906","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":514907,"authors":[{"name":"Shang-Hung Lin","affiliation":["Princeton University, USA"],"lastName":"Shang-Hung Lin","id":"37087309592"},{"name":"S.Y.

Thus most data classifiers are designed to have K output nodes corresponding to K classes, {w/sub i/: i=1,...,K}. When pattern classes are clearly separated, this kind of data classifier usually performs very well. A specific model is the decision-based neural network (DBNN), which is effective in many signal/image classification applications. This is particularly the case when pattern classes are clearly separable. However, for those applications which have complex pattern distribution with two or more classes overlapping in pattern space, the traditional DBNN may not be effective or appropriate. For such applications, it is preferable to adopt a probabilistic classifier. In this paper, we develop a new probabilistic variant of the DBNN, which is meant for better estimate probability density functions corresponding to different pattern classes. For this purpose, new learning rules for probabilistic DBNN are derived. In experiments on face databases, we have observed noticeable improvement in various performance measures such as recognition accuracies and, in particular, false acceptance/rejection rates. Taking advantage of probabilistic output values of the DBNN, we construct a multiple sensor fusion system for object classification. In a sense, it represents an extension of the traditional hierarchical structure of DBNN.","doi":"10.1109/NNSP.1995.514907","startPage":"333","endPage":"342","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/3947/11423/00514907.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NNSP.1995.514907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A probabilistic DBNN with applications to sensor fusion and object recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensor fusion","Object recognition","Covariance matrix","Thyristors","Gaussian distribution","Linear matrix inequalities","Neural networks","Pattern recognition","Databases","Particle measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensor fusion","object recognition","neural nets","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probabilistic DBNN","decision-based neural network","sensor fusion","object recognition","data classifiers","signal classification","image classification","complex pattern distribution","probability density functions","face databases","recognition accuracies","false acceptance/rejection rates","probabilistic output values","multiple sensor fusion system","object classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/514907/","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Aug-2 Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"A probabilistic DBNN with applications to sensor fusion and object recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5087360","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A probabilistic DBNN with applications to sensor fusion and object recognition","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00514907.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040429S","chronDate":"31 Aug-2 Sep 1995","isNumber":"11423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3947","citationCount":"9","articleId":"514907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":514908,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In this paper it is shown that training the SOM algorithm by using different weighting for sample blocks having different statistical characteristics one can further increase the compression efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/514908/","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Aug-2 Sep 1995","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5087361","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sample weighting when training self-organizing maps for image compression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sample weighting when training self-organizing maps for image compression","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00514908.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039667S","chronDate":"31 Aug-2 Sep 1995","isNumber":"11423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3947","citationCount":"10","articleId":"514908","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":514913,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Artificial neural networks (ANN) are excellent tools for pattern recognition problems when signal to noise ratio is low. An automated decision process based on modified raw data inputs showed successful proceeding of a backpropagation ANN with an overall performance of 87% correct classifications with previously unknown data. Investigating the specific influences of prototypical input patterns on a specially designed ANN led to a sparse and efficient data coding, based on a combination of expert knowledge and the internal representation structures of the ANN. Data coding obtained by this semiautomated procedure yielded a list of feature vectors, each representing the relevant information for saccade identification. The feature based ANN produced a reduction of the error rate of nearly 40% and reached an overall correct classification of 92% with unknown data. The proposed method of extracting internal ANN knowledge is not restricted to EOG recordings, and could be used in various fields of signal analysis.","doi":"10.1109/NNSP.1995.514921","pdfPath":"/iel3/3947/11423/00514921.pdf","startPage":"465","endPage":"474","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NNSP.1995.514921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semiautomated extraction of decision relevant features from a raw data based artificial neural network demonstrated by the problem of saccade detection in EOG recordings of smooth pursuit eye movements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/514921/","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Aug-2 Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Semiautomated extraction of decision relevant features from a raw data based artificial neural network demonstrated by the problem of saccade detection in EOG recordings of smooth pursuit eye movements","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5087374","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semiautomated extraction of decision relevant features from a raw data based artificial neural network demonstrated by the problem of saccade detection in EOG recordings of smooth pursuit eye movements","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00514921.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027891S","chronDate":"31 Aug-2 Sep 1995","isNumber":"11423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3947","articleId":"514921","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":514922,"authors":[{"name":"C.W.

However, a limiting factor in on-line processing has been the need to preprocess input patterns so that features fall in the range [0.0, 1.0], typically done with scale-factors that depend on the input range of each feature. This paper demonstrates a method by which the scaling of features becomes adaptive, eliminating the need to batch-process patterns before presenting them to the ART network. The resulting network implementation for on-line learning does not call for any knowledge of the feature signals, ranges or otherwise. A variety of implications of this scheme are analyzed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Aug-2 Sep 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/514926/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5087379","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 1995","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive preprocessing for on-line learning with adaptive resonance theory (ART) networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive preprocessing for on-line learning with adaptive resonance theory (ART) networks","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00514926.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047288S","chronDate":"31 Aug-2 Sep 1995","isNumber":"11423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3947","citationCount":"3","articleId":"514926","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":514929,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The parameters of the PMF are computed by minimization of the accumulated relative entropy (ARE) cost function. The equivalence of ARE minimization to maximum partial log-likelihood (MPLL) estimation is established under certain regularity conditions which enables the authors to bypass the requirement that the true conditionals be known. The large sample properties of MPLL estimator are obtained under further regularity conditions, and the binary case with sigmoidal perceptron as the conditional PMF model is shown to be a special case of the new framework. Results are presented which show that the multilayer perceptron (MLP) equalizer based on ARE minimization can always recover from convergence at the wrong extreme whereas the mean square error (MSE) based MLP can not.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Aug-2 Sep 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/514929/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5087382","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"A maximum partial likelihood framework for channel equalization by distribution learning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A maximum partial likelihood framework for channel equalization by distribution learning","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00514929.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09577S","chronDate":"31 Aug-2 Sep 1995","isNumber":"11423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3947","citationCount":"1","articleId":"514929","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":514930,"authors":[{"name":"C.Z.W.H.

In the linearly separable case, no hidden layer is constructed. The parameters of the network are identified by standard linear programming techniques.

It is assumed that some substations are equipped with current magnitude measurements. Unique state estimation is possible, in such a situation, if currents are combined with voltage or power measurements and inequality constraints on node power injections are taken into account. A state estimation algorithm facilitating the efficient incorporation of inequality constraints is developed using an interior point optimization method. Simulation results showing the performance of the algorithm are presented. The method can be used for state estimation in medium voltage subtransmission and distribution networks.","doi":"10.1109/PICA.1995.515268","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Power Industry Computer Applications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Power Industry Computer Applications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/3946/11422/00515268.pdf","startPage":"385","endPage":"391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PICA.1995.515268","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"An interior point method for state estimation with current magnitude measurements and inequality constraints","conferenceDate":"7-12 May 1995","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5079983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/515268/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An interior point method for state estimation with current magnitude measurements and inequality constraints","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"00515268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042219S","chronDate":"7-12 May 1995","isNumber":"11422","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3946","citationCount":"12","articleId":"515268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":515269,"authors":[{"name":"I.W.

The switch consists of an intersecting waveguide matrix, matching oil, and microactuators. Switching is based on the movement of oil due to capillary pressure, which is controlled by the microactuator. The necessary switching conditions were calculated and the results showed that both the oil volume and the microactuator position must be controlled. A trial optical switch was fabricated to test the switching principle, and switching and self-holding were both confirmed.

The original algorithm was first published in 1984 by Cleary and Witten, and a series of improvements was described by Moffat (1990), culminating in a careful implementation, called PPMC, which has become the benchmark version. This still achieves results superior to virtually all other compression methods, despite many attempts to better it. PPM, is a finite-context statistical modeling technique that can be viewed as blending together several fixed-order context models to predict the next character in the input sequence. Prediction probabilities for each context in the model are calculated from frequency counts which are updated adaptively; and the symbol that actually occurs is encoded relative to its predicted distribution using arithmetic coding. The paper describes a new algorithm, PPM*, which exploits contexts of unbounded length. It reliably achieves compression superior to PPMC, although our current implementation uses considerably greater computational resources (both time and space). The basic PPM compression scheme is described, showing the use of contexts of unbounded length, and how it can be implemented using a tree data structure. Some results are given that demonstrate an improvement of about 6% over the old method.","doi":"10.1109/DCC.1995.515495","publicationTitle":"Proceedings DCC '95 Data Compression Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings DCC '95 Data Compression Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/3874/11296/00515495.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DCC.1995.515495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11296","startPage":"52","endPage":"61","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unbounded length contexts for PPM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=515495","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Unbounded length contexts for PPM","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Mar 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/515495/","conferenceDate":"28-30 March 1995","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5086180","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unbounded length contexts for PPM","confLoc":"Snowbird, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"00515495.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03244S","chronDate":"28-30 Mar 1995","isNumber":"11296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3874","citationCount":"58","articleId":"515495","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":515499,"authors":[{"name":"S.

They are a variation of the hidden Markov models (HMM) combining the power of explicit conditioning on past observations and the power of using hidden states. (P)HMM may be combined with arithmetic coding for lossless data compression. A general 2-part coding scheme for given model order but unknown parameters based on PHMM is presented. A forward-backward reestimation of parameters with a redefined backward variable is given for these models and used for estimating the unknown parameters. Proof of convergence of this reestimation is given. The PHMM structure and the conditions of the convergence proof allows for application of the PHMM to image coding. Relations between the PHMM and hidden Markov models (HMM) are treated. Results of coding bi-level images with the PHMM coding scheme is given.

One factor that helped it gain the popularity it enjoys today was the publication in 1987 of source code for a multi symbol arithmetic coder in Communications of the ACM. Now (1995), our understanding of arithmetic coding has further matured, and it is timely to review the components of that implementation and summarise the improvements that we and other authors have developed since then. We also describe a novel method for performing the underlying calculation needed for arithmetic coding. Accompanying the paper is a \"Mark II\" implementation that incorporates the improvements we suggest. The areas examined include: changes to the coding procedure that reduce the number of multiplications and divisions and permit them to be done to low precision; the increased range of probability approximations and alphabet sizes that can be supported using limited precision calculation; data structures for support of arithmetic coding on large alphabets; the interface between the modelling and coding subsystems; the use of enhanced models to allow high performance compression. For each of these areas, we consider how the new implementation differs from the CACM package.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Arithmetic coding revisited","doi":"10.1109/DCC.1995.515510","startPage":"202","endPage":"211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DCC.1995.515510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11296","publicationTitle":"Proceedings DCC '95 Data Compression Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings DCC '95 Data Compression Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/3874/11296/00515510.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=515510","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/515510/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"Arithmetic coding revisited","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5093531","conferenceDate":"28-30 March 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arithmetic coding revisited","confLoc":"Snowbird, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"00515510.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039003S","chronDate":"28-30 Mar 1995","isNumber":"11296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3874","citationCount":"68","articleId":"515510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":515511,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It is wavelet based using a \"reversible\" approximation of one of the best wavelet filters. Reversible wavelets are linear filters with non linear rounding which implement exact reconstruction systems with minimal precision integer arithmetic. Wavelet coefficients are encoded in a bit significance embedded order, allowing lossy compression by simply truncating the compressed data. For coding of coefficients, CREW uses a method similar to J. Shapiro's (1993) zero tree, and a completely novel method called Horizon. Horizon coding is a context based coding that takes advantage of the spatial and spectral information available in the wavelet domain. CREW provides state of the art lossless compression of medical images (greater than 8 bits deep), and lossy and lossless compression of 8 bit deep images with a single system. CREW has reasonable software and hardware implementations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CREW: Compression with Reversible Embedded Wavelets","publicationTitle":"Proceedings DCC '95 Data Compression Conference","doi":"10.1109/DCC.1995.515511","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings DCC '95 Data Compression Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/3874/11296/00515511.pdf","startPage":"212","endPage":"221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DCC.1995.515511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11296","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=515511","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/515511/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"CREW: Compression with Reversible Embedded Wavelets","conferenceDate":"28-30 March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5093532","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CREW: Compression with Reversible Embedded Wavelets","confLoc":"Snowbird, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"00515511.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042827S","chronDate":"28-30 Mar 1995","isNumber":"11296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3874","citationCount":"115","articleId":"515511","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":515524,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this work, by developing an entropy-constrained quantization framework, we show that these previous works do not fully realize the attainable coding gain, and then formulate a computationally efficient way that attempts to fully realize this gain for baseline-JPEG-decodable systems. Interestingly, we find that the gains obtained using the previous algorithms are almost additive. The framework involves viewing a scalar-quantized system with fixed quantizers as a special type of vector quantizer (VQ), and then to use techniques akin to entropy-constrained vector quantization (ECVQ) to optimize the system. In the JPEG case, a computationally efficient algorithm can be derived, without training, by jointly performing coefficient thresholding, quantizer selection, and Huffman table customization, all compatible with the baseline JPEG syntax. Our algorithm achieves significant R-D improvement over standard JPEG (about 2 dB for typical images) with performance comparable to that of more complex \"state-of-the-art\" coders. For example, for the Lenna image coded at 1.0 bits per pixel, our JPEG-compatible coder achieves a PSNR of 39.6 dB, which even slightly exceeds the published performance of Shapiro's wavelet coder. Although PSNR does not guarantee subjective performance, our algorithm can be applied with a flexible range of visually-based distortion metrics.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DCC.1995.515524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11296","startPage":"342","endPage":"351","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings DCC '95 Data Compression Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/3874/11296/00515524.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"JPEG optimization using an entropy-constrained quantization framework","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/515524/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"JPEG optimization using an entropy-constrained quantization framework","conferenceDate":"28-30 March 1995","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5093545","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"JPEG optimization using an entropy-constrained quantization framework","confLoc":"Snowbird, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"00515524.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034478S","chronDate":"28-30 Mar 1995","isNumber":"11296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3874","citationCount":"12","articleId":"515524","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":515528,"authors":[{"name":"W.C.

The new method is a subband coding approach that employs motion compensation, and uses prediction-frame and intra-frame coding within the framework. It is unique in that it allows lossy coding of the motion vectors through its use of multistage residual vector quantization (RVQ). Furthermore, it selects the motion vector with the best rate-distortion tradeoff among a number of possible motion vector candidates, and provides a rate-distortion-based mechanism for alternating between intra-frame and inter-frame coding. The framework provides an easy way to control the system complexity and performance, and inherently supports multiresolution transmission.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach to scalable video coding","publicationTitle":"Proceedings DCC '95 Data Compression Conference","doi":"10.1109/DCC.1995.515528","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings DCC '95 Data Compression Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/3874/11296/00515528.pdf","startPage":"381","endPage":"390","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DCC.1995.515528","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11296","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=515528","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/515528/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"A new approach to scalable video coding","conferenceDate":"28-30 March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5086184","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach to scalable video coding","confLoc":"Snowbird, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"00515528.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041781S","chronDate":"28-30 Mar 1995","isNumber":"11296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3874","citationCount":"14","articleId":"515528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":515607,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

In this paper, we present new precomputation architectures for both combinational and sequential logic and describe new precomputation-based logic synthesis methods that optimize logic circuits for low power. We present a general precomputation architecture for sequential logic circuits and show that it is significantly more powerful than the architectures previously treated in the literature. In this architecture, output values required in a particular clock cycle are selectively precomputed one clock cycle earlier, and the original logic circuit is \"turned off\" in the succeeding clock cycle. The very power of this architecture makes the synthesis of precomputation logic a challenging problem and we present a method to automatically synthesize precomputation logic for this architecture. We introduce a powerful precomputation architecture for combinational logic circuits that uses transmission gates or transparent latches to disable parts of the logic. Unlike in the sequential circuit architecture, precomputation occurs in an early portion of a clock cycle, and parts of the combinational logic circuit are \"turned off\" in a later portion of the same clock cycle. Further we are not restricted to perform precomputation on the primary inputs. Preliminary results obtained using the described methods are presented. Up to 66 percent reductions in switching activity and power dissipation are possible using the proposed architectures. For many examples, the proposed architectures result in significantly less power dissipation than previously developed methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Sixteenth Conference on Advanced Research in VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel3/3881/11305/00515637.pdf","startPage":"430","endPage":"444","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Sixteenth Conference on Advanced Research in VLSI","doi":"10.1109/ARVLSI.1995.515637","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARVLSI.1995.515637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11305","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=515637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of combinational and sequential logic circuits for low power using precomputation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sequential circuits","Combinational circuits","Clocks","Power dissipation","Circuit synthesis","Logic circuits","Automatic logic units","Switching circuits","Optimization methods","Latches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","logic design","combinational circuits","sequential circuits","VLSI","CMOS logic circuits","integrated circuit design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinational logic circuits","sequential logic circuits","low power optimisation","precomputation","logic optimization technique","precomputation architectures","logic synthesis methods","transmission gates","transparent latches","clock cycle","switching activity reduction","power dissipation reduction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/515637/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of combinational and sequential logic circuits for low power using precomputation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5161306","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-29 March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of combinational and sequential logic circuits for low power using precomputation","confLoc":"Chapel Hill, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"00515637.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057697S","chronDate":"27-29 Mar 1995","isNumber":"11305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3881","citationCount":"17","articleId":"515637","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":515669,"authors":[{"name":"R.H.

In a multi-carrier application with close adjacent channels (such as an FDMA satellite system), the spectral regrowth of adjacent channels can result in severe interference with the desired carrier. This may lead to substantial BER performance degradation or make necessary an increase in the spacing between carriers. The transmitted carrier may suffer levels of spurious RF emission which exceed system specifications or spectral mask regulations. This paper proposes a new 4-dimensional trellis coding technique which can be applied to conventional QPSK modulation, and which leads to substantially reduced levels of spectral regrowth. When the coding is applied, the modulated signal exhibits a reduced degree of envelope fluctuation, and hence it is less affected by amplitude nonlinearity. The scheme is termed Almost-Constant-Envelope QPSK (ACE-QPSK).","doi":"10.1109/SICON.1993.515709","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Singapore International Conference on Networks/International Conference on Information Engineering '93","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Singapore International Conference on Networks/International Conference on Information Engineering '93","pdfPath":"/iel2/3866/11283/00515709.pdf","startPage":"862","endPage":"866 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SICON.1993.515709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ACE-QPSK: a new method of coding QPSK for the nonlinear transmitter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=515709","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 Sep 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/515709/","displayDocTitle":"ACE-QPSK: a new method of coding QPSK for the nonlinear transmitter","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"5073820","conferenceDate":"6-11 Sept. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ACE-QPSK: a new method of coding QPSK for the nonlinear transmitter","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00515709.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045291S","chronDate":"6-11 Sep 1993","isNumber":"11283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3866","citationCount":"1","articleId":"515709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":515861,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The authors have formulated the phenomenon of soft handoffs as a reward/cost stochastic optimization problem wherein the reward is a function of some measurable characteristics of the received signal, and cost can be associated with different factors such as multiple simultaneous active connections, connection set-up and termination overheads. Using dynamic programming, a maximum net reward policy that specifies the optimal base stations the mobile should be associated with during each time slot, is determined. The authors also extend their results to the case when there are more than two base stations. Furthermore, the decisions are taken in a decentralized online manner. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms offer considerable improvement over the policy proposed in the IS-95 standard.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM'95","pdfPath":"/iel3/3882/11306/00515866.pdf","startPage":"105","endPage":"112 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM'95","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1995.515866","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1995.515866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11306","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=515866","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal scheduling of soft handoffs in DS/CDMA communication systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimal scheduling","Multiaccess communication","Base stations","Fading","Cost function","Spread spectrum communication","Personal communication networks","Frequency","Interference","Multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scheduling","dynamic programming","cellular radio","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","code division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal scheduling","soft handoffs","DS/CDMA communication systems","cellular networks","reward stochastic optimization","received signal","active connections","dynamic programming","maximum net reward policy","optimal base stations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/515866/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Apr 1995","displayDocTitle":"Optimal scheduling of soft handoffs in DS/CDMA communication systems","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5105791","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-6 April 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal scheduling of soft handoffs in DS/CDMA communication systems","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00515866.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026433S","chronDate":"2-6 Apr 1995","isNumber":"11306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3882","citationCount":"3","articleId":"515866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":515909,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The experimental setup which was used to capture, digitize, and compress the video stream is described. Although the study is conducted at the frame level (as opposed to the slice level), it is observed that the inter-frame correlation structure for the frame-size sequence involves complicated forms of pseudo-periodicity that are mainly affected by the compression pattern of the sequence. A simple model for an MPEG traffic source is developed in which frames are generated according to the compression pattern of the original captured video stream. The number of cells per frame is fitted by a lognormal distribution.

An experiment performed reveals that the distortion on the photocopy of a document is very different in the vertical and horizontal directions.

A line that is marked is always accompanied by two unmarked control lines one above and one below. They are used to measure distortions in the vertical and horizontal directions in order to decide whether line or word shift should be detected. Line shifts are detected using a centroid method that bases its decision on the relative distance of line centroids.

It is difficult to support this class of traffic since, on one hand, compressed video is bursty, while on the other hand, it requires performance guarantees from the network. The common belief is that we are unlikely to achieve a high network utilization while providing performance guarantees to such bursty sources. The authors introduce a new deterministic bounding interval-dependent (D-BIND) traffic model, together with tight analysis techniques, to explore the possibility of providing deterministic performance guarantees to VBR traffic while still achieving a reasonable network utilization. The D-BIND model consists of a family of rate-interval pairs where the rate is a bounding rate over the interval length. The model captures the intuitive property that over longer interval lengths, a source may be bounded by a rate lower than its peak rate and closer to its long-term overage rate. While the D-BIND model is a general deterministic model that can be used to characterize a wide variety of sources, the authors focus on MPEG-compressed video. Using two 10 minute traces, they demonstrate the effectiveness of the new model and show that, contrary to common belief, reasonable network utilization can be achieved for compressed video, even when deterministic guarantees are provided.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1995.515991","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM'95","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM'95","pdfPath":"/iel3/3882/11308/00515991.pdf","startPage":"1137","endPage":"1145 vol.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1995.515991","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=515991","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Apr 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/515991/","displayDocTitle":"Traffic characterization and switch utilization using a deterministic bounding interval dependent traffic model","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5112252","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-6 April 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic characterization and switch utilization using a deterministic bounding interval dependent traffic model","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00515991.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042018S","chronDate":"2-6 Apr 1995","isNumber":"11308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3882","citationCount":"51","articleId":"515991","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":516020,"authors":[{"name":"B.A. Alhalabi","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Southwestern Louisiana, Lafayette, LA, USA"],"firstName":"B.A.","lastName":"Alhalabi","id":"37352400100"},{"name":"M.

Nine cases, each with a different seal ring radius, are evaluated in terms of the equivalent stress (Mises) and interfacial stress distributions on the brazing surface at both the seal ring and substrate sides. The investigation has concluded that stress concentration depends mainly on the ratio between the seal ring width, w, and the outer radius, R.

This is due to the simplicity of the technique, and to its ability to solve very complicated problems. Scattering from an infinitely long perfect electrical conductor (PEC) cylinder is studied to show how accuracy varies with field sampling point location. It is shown that accuracy varies with respect to the location of the field sampling point, and convergence at one point does not guarantee that the other points in the problem space have converged. Scattering from a PEC cylinder is also used to show how low frequency field solutions are affected by the number of time steps used in the FDTD algorithm. For low-frequency solutions, the FDTD algorithm has to run long enough to capture the low frequency spectra. Additionally, the absorbing boundaries have to be placed far away enough so that reflections do not contaminate the low frequency spectra of the signal.","doi":"10.1109/SOUTHC.1995.516135","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Southcon '95","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Southcon '95","pdfPath":"/iel3/3888/11314/00516135.pdf","startPage":"385","endPage":"390","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOUTHC.1995.516135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accuracy considerations for FDTD field solutions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=516135","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Mar 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/516135/","displayDocTitle":"Accuracy considerations for FDTD field solutions","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5099213","conferenceDate":"7-9 March 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accuracy considerations for FDTD field solutions","confLoc":"Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00516135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035521S","chronDate":"7-9 Mar 1995","isNumber":"11314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3888","citationCount":"1","articleId":"516135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":516136,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The importance of these results has triggered the development of many approaches which try to determine an \"appropriate\" network size for a given problem. Although it has been demonstrated that most of the approaches manage to find small size networks which solve the problem at hand, it is quite remarkable that the generalization capabilities of these networks have not been explored thoroughly. In this paper, we propose the coupling of genetic algorithms and weight pruning with the objective of both reducing network size and improving generalization. The innovation of our approach relies on the use of a fitness function which uses an adaptive parameter to encourage the reproduction of networks having good generalization performance and a relatively small size.","doi":"10.1109/SOUTHC.1995.516136","startPage":"392","endPage":"397","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Southcon '95","pdfPath":"/iel3/3888/11314/00516136.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Southcon '95","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOUTHC.1995.516136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving generalization by using genetic algorithms to determine the neural network size","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Neural networks","Technological innovation","Training data","Computer networks","Electronic mail","Feedforward neural networks","Convergence","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","generalisation (artificial intelligence)","feedforward neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalization","genetic algorithms","neural network size","free parameters","ionosphere database","weight pruning","fitness function","adaptive parameter","numbers database","layered feedforward neural networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/516136/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"Improving generalization by using genetic algorithms to determine the neural network size","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-9 March 1995","accessionNumber":"5099214","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving generalization by using genetic algorithms to determine the neural network size","confLoc":"Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00516136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.133504S","chronDate":"7-9 Mar 1995","isNumber":"11314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3888","citationCount":"3","articleId":"516136","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":516201,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Higher spectral resolution for each pixel should make possible the discrimination of a larger number of classes in more detail. However, due to the scarcity of training samples in remote sensing applications, the increase in spectral dimensionality only complicates the design of classifiers which, if not properly done, may cause the deterioration of classification accuracy. In this work, we propose a new design procedure for a hybrid decision tree classifier which improves the classification efficiency and accuracy for classifying high-dimensional data with a small training sample size. We further propose to use a feature extraction technique based on maximizing the statistical distance between two subgroups. Experimental results show that the proposed tree classifier is more effective in classifying high-dimensional data with limited training samples than a single-layer classifier and a previously proposed hybrid tree classifier.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.1996.516476","publicationTitle":"IGARSS '96. 1996 International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"IGARSS '96. 1996 International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/3772/11016/00516476.pdf","startPage":"790","endPage":"792 vol.1","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.1996.516476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A decision tree classifier design for high-dimensional data with limited training samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 May 1996","displayDocTitle":"A decision tree classifier design for high-dimensional data with limited training samples","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"31-31 May 1996","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5385339","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/516476/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A decision tree classifier design for high-dimensional data with limited training samples","confLoc":"Lincoln, NE, USA","sourcePdf":"00516476.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025934S","chronDate":"27-31 May 1996","isNumber":"11016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3772","citationCount":"7","articleId":"516476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":516478,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The distinct polarization scattering signatures of sea ice and open water are discussed and illustrated with the dual-polarized radar measurements from the Seasat-A scatterometer (SASS).

A simple classification algorithm using the thresholds of the copol ratio and backscatter levels is proposed. The feasibility of this algorithm is demonstrated using the SASS data from the single-sided, dual-polarization mode.

The authors' goal is to develop a classification algorithm which is stable in terms of applicability in different geographical regions. Unlike optical remote sensing techniques, radar remote sensing can provide calibrated data where the image signal is solely determined by the physical (structural) and electrical properties of the targets on the Earth's surface and near subsurface. Hence, a classifier based on radar signatures of object classes should be applicable on new calibrated images without the need to train the classifier again. This article discusses the design and applicability of a classification algorithm, which is based on calibrated radar signatures measured from ERS-1 (C-band, vv polarized) and JERS-1 (L-band, hh polarized) SAR image data. The applicability is compared in two different test sites, Raco, Michigan and the Cedar Creek LTER site, Minnesota.

An unsupervised Kohonen neutral network was used to classify, the cloud contents of a 8/spl times/8 blocks in an image into ten different cloud classes. Inputs to the network consisted of textural features of each block obtained using an efficient feature extraction scheme namely, the wavelet transform (WT). This scheme not only reduces the dimensionality of the data but also extracts useful features of the data. To improve the detection rate and reduce the false positive rate, especially for low clouds and thin high clouds, a multi-channel fusion system was constructed to combine the results of different optical bands. All alternative approach for automatic cloud detection/classification based on multi-spectral features was also studied to analyze and compare the effectiveness of multi-spectral-based scheme vs textural-based scheme. The results using high resolution GOES 8 data show the promise of the Kohonen neural network when used in conjunction with WT as feature extractor for cloud detection/classification.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.1996.516582","startPage":"1105","endPage":"1107 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"IGARSS '96. 1996 International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/3772/11017/00516582.pdf","publicationTitle":"IGARSS '96. 1996 International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.1996.516582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11017","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network-based cloud detection/classification using textural and spectral features","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Clouds","Data mining","Satellites","Feature extraction","Robustness","Computer vision","Image texture analysis","Wavelet transforms","Atmosphere"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clouds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmosphere","meteorology","cloud","optical imaging","remote sensing","measurement technique","image classification","feature extraction","neural net","Kohonen neutral network","spectral features","image texture","image processing","automatic cloud detection","wavelet transform","multidimensional signal processing","multispectral imaging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/516582/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 May 1996","displayDocTitle":"Neural network-based cloud detection/classification using textural and spectral features","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"31-31 May 1996","accessionNumber":"5424769","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network-based cloud detection/classification using textural and spectral features","confLoc":"Lincoln, NE, USA","sourcePdf":"00516582.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043388S","chronDate":"27-31 May 1996","isNumber":"11017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3772","citationCount":"5","articleId":"516582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":516621,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The success of this algorithm is due in part to its conceptual simplicity, and in part to a number of approximations which reduce the computational complexity of the method. However, the widespread use of these same approximations has given the Range-Doppler algorithm the (mostly undeserved) reputation of producing inferior image quality, especially with regard to phase. In recent years, the Chirp-Scaling algorithm has been proposed as an alternative to Range-Doppler. The Chirp-Scaling algorithm avoids the complicated and computationally expensive interpolations used by the Range-Doppler algorithm and is more naturally phase preserving. RADARSAT (single beam) data, in view of its moderate squint and multiple PRF Doppler Centroid excursion across an image, is a good test case for both algorithms. Atlantis, with the support of the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, has developed a desk top software processor which implements both the Range-Doppler and Chirp-Scaling algorithms. In this paper, a comparison is made between the performance of the two algorithms with reference to the RADARSAT sensor. As well, issues of implementation and computational complexity are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.1996.516621","publicationTitle":"IGARSS '96. 1996 International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"IGARSS '96. 1996 International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/3772/11017/00516621.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.1996.516621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11017","startPage":"1221","endPage":"1223 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of the Range-Doppler and Chirp Scaling algorithms with reference to RADARSAT","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=516621","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of the Range-Doppler and Chirp Scaling algorithms with reference to RADARSAT","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 May 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/516621/","conferenceDate":"31-31 May 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5424807","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of the Range-Doppler and Chirp Scaling algorithms with reference to RADARSAT","confLoc":"Lincoln, NE, USA","sourcePdf":"00516621.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078262S","chronDate":"27-31 May 1996","isNumber":"11017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3772","citationCount":"15","articleId":"516621","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":516676,"authors":[{"name":"J.T.

In certain practical situations, however, this condition is difficult to satisfy. As a result, a number of undesirable effect such as the spectral leakage associated with the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and the truncation errors in digital wattmeters arise and degrade system performance. This paper presents a new approach which attempts to remedy the underlying problem. The basic idea of the proposed method is to modify the actual sampled sequence such that it becomes an ideal sample sequence which is synchronized with the signal subjected to sampling. A simple algorithm for modifying the sampled sequence on-line is derived based on interpolation. The proposed approach requires quite modest additional computational burden which makes it suitable for real-time signal professing. To illustrate the practical applicability of the proposed algorithm, the paper considers two distinct but common cases. First, it shows how the proposed method can be used in the case of DFT analysis of harmonic signals, and secondly, it considers the digital wattmeter application area in electrical power-system measurement. Results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of reducing both the leakage effect in DFT analysis and truncation errors in digital wattmeters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/517004/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"45","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5338060","displayDocTitle":"A new algorithm for improving the accuracy of periodic signal analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new algorithm for improving the accuracy of periodic signal analysis","sourcePdf":"00517004.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058834S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"56","articleId":"517004","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":517009,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.

Furthermore, this spectral variation itself will be a function of pumping. This paper describes an accurate and sensitive experimental determination of the pump dependence of the refractive index in an erbium-doped fiber amplifier. A Mach-Zehnder interferometric measurement is described where only one arm is comprised of doped fiber. Particular attention is paid to accounting for the significant difference in power levels in the two arms and the effects of polarization and incoherent light. The measured refractive-index change matches well with that theoretically predicted. The pumped and unpumped dispersion of the amplifier are calculated. While the extra dispersion is of similar magnitude to that of silica fiber, the impact on long telecommunications systems is likely to be negligible. However, this extra dispersion may be important in shorter systems such as soliton lasers. Given the good agreement between theory and experiment, the variation of dispersion with fractional inversion is calculated from absorption and gain measurements. The presence of codopants is known to alter the absorption and emission spectra; the effect on the dispersion is calculated, and a near linear dependence on germanium concentration is observed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/517009/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1996","accessionNumber":"5312702","volume":"32","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Measurement and analysis of pump-dependent refractive index and dispersion effects in erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement and analysis of pump-dependent refractive index and dispersion effects in erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00517009.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033417S","chronDate":"Jul 1996","isNumber":"11007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"39","articleId":"517009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":517013,"authors":[{"name":"X.S.

It is, however, time-consuming and difficult to fine-tune them to improve their behavior. This paper describes a tuning method for fuzzy models which is applicable regardless of the form of fuzzy rules and the used defuzzification method. For this purpose, this paper proposes a fuzzy neural network model which can embody fuzzy models. The proposed model provides the functions to perform fuzzy inference and to tune the parameters for the shape of antecedent linguistic terms, the relative importance degrees of rules, and the relative importance degrees of antecedent linguistic terms in rules.

Then an additive fuzzy system approximates a function by covering its graph with ellipsoidal rule patches. It averages rule patches that overlap. The best fuzzy rules cover the extrema or bumps in the function. Neural or statistical clustering systems can approximate the unknown fuzzy rules from training data. Neural systems can then both tune these rules and add rules to improve the function approximation. We use a hybrid neural system that combines unsupervised and supervised learning to find and tune the rules in the form of ellipsoids. Unsupervised competitive learning finds the first-order and second-order statistics of clusters in the training data. The covariance matrix of each cluster gives an ellipsoid centered at the vector or centroid of the data cluster. The supervised neural system learns with gradient descent. It locally minimizes the mean-squared error of the fuzzy function approximation. In the hybrid system unsupervised learning initializes the gradient descent. The hybrid system tends to give a more accurate function approximation than does the lone unsupervised or supervised system. We found a closed-form model for the optimal rules when only the centroids of the ellipsoids change. We used numerical techniques to find the optimal rules in the general case.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Function approximation","Ellipsoids","Fuzzy systems","Training data","Shape","Supervised learning","Statistics","Covariance matrix","Unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","unsupervised learning","function approximation","fuzzy neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy rule","ellipsoidal rules","fuzzy function approximation","function approximation","statistical clustering","hybrid neural system","competitive learning","covariance matrix","gradient descent","mean-squared error","unsupervised learning"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.517030","startPage":"542","endPage":"560","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/11064/00517030.pdf","doi":"10.1109/3477.517030","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy function approximation with ellipsoidal rules","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1996","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy function approximation with ellipsoidal rules","accessionNumber":"5337643","pubMedId":"18263053","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","volume":"26","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/517030/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy function approximation with ellipsoidal rules","sourcePdf":"00517030.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021883S","chronDate":"Aug.  1996","isNumber":"11064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"174","articleId":"517030","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":517042,"authors":[{"name":"Shie-Jue Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shie-Jue Lee","id":"37087143929"},{"name":"Mu-Tune Jone","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Mu-Tune Jone","id":"37087968808"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"517042","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=517042","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","transfer functions","polynomials","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","supervised dichotomy","supervised two-class discretization","continuous ID3 algorithm","linear activation functions","decision boundaries","arbitrary function"]}],"doi":"10.1109/3477.517042","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/11064/00517042.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","startPage":"660","endPage":"665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.517042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An extended procedure of constructing neural networks for supervised dichotomy","abstract":"K.J.

In particular, at every frame, each camera tracks a number of parts depending on the visibility of these parts and the observability of their predicted motion from the specific camera. To relate points on the occluding contours of the parts to points on their models we apply concepts from projective geometry. Then, within the physics-based framework we compute the generalized forces applied from the parts' occluding contours to model points of the body parts. These forces update the translational and rotational degrees of freedom of the model, such as to minimize the discrepancy between the sensory data and the estimated model state.

The novelty of this technique is three-fold In (i) its theoretical development, (ii) its application, and, (iii) its experimental implementation. The concept of phase of polarization of a light wave is introduced to computer vision for discrimination between materials according to their intrinsic electrical conductivity, such as distinguishing conducting metals, and poorly-conducting dielectrics. Previous work has used intensity, color and polarization component ratios. This new method is based on the physical principle that metals retard orthogonal components of light upon reflection while dielectrics do not. This method has significant complementary advantages with respect to existing techniques, is computationally efficient, and can be easily implemented with existing imaging technology. Experiments for real circuit board inspection, non-conductive and conductive glass, and, outdoor object recognition have been performed to demonstrate its accuracy and potential capabilities.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1996.517064","publicationTitle":"Proceedings CVPR IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings CVPR IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/3776/11029/00517064.pdf","startPage":"128","endPage":"135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1996.517064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polarization phase-based method for material classification and object recognition in computer vision","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=517064","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 June 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/517064/","displayDocTitle":"Polarization phase-based method for material classification and object recognition in computer vision","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5329261","conferenceDate":"18-20 June 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polarization phase-based method for material classification and object recognition in computer vision","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00517064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02602S","chronDate":"18-20 June 1996","isNumber":"11029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3776","citationCount":"6","articleId":"517064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":517065,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The underlying principle is the evolution of a simple closed curve whose points move in the direction of the normal with prescribed velocity. A fundamental limitation of the method as it stands is that it cannot deal with important image features such as triple points. The method also requires a choice of an \"edge-strength\" function, defined over the image domain. Indicating the likelihood of an object boundary being present at any point in the image domain. This implies a separate preprocessing step, in essence precomputing approximate boundaries in the presence of noise. One also has to choose the initial curve. It is shown here that the different versions of curve evolution used in Computer Vision together with the preprocessing step can be integrated in the form of a new segmentation functional which overcomes these limitations and extends curve evolution models. Moreover, the numerical solutions obtained retain sharp discontinuities or \"shocks\", thus providing sharp demarcation of object boundaries.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A common framework for curve evolution, segmentation and anisotropic diffusion","publicationTitle":"Proceedings CVPR IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1996.517065","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings CVPR IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/3776/11029/00517065.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1996.517065","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11029","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=517065","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/517065/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 June 1996","displayDocTitle":"A common framework for curve evolution, segmentation and anisotropic diffusion","conferenceDate":"18-20 June 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5329262","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A common framework for curve evolution, segmentation and anisotropic diffusion","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00517065.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037045S","chronDate":"18-20 June 1996","isNumber":"11029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3776","citationCount":"125","articleId":"517065","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":517074,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The mixture-distance technique we introduce achieves a recognition rate of 95% on a database of 685 people in which each face is represented by 30 measured distances. This is currently the best recorded recognition rate for a feature-based system applied to a database of this size. By comparison, nearest neighbor search using Euclidean distance yields 84%. In our work a novel distance function is constructed based on local second order statistics as estimated by modeling the training data as a mixture of normal densities. We report on the results from mixtures of several sizes. We demonstrate that a flat mixture of mixtures performs as well as the best model and therefore represents an effective solution to the model selection problem. A mixture perspective is also taken for individual Gaussians to choose between first order (variance) and second order (covariance) models. Here an approximation to flat combination is proposed and seen to perform well in practice. Our results demonstrate that even in the absence of multiple training examples for each class, it is sometimes possible to infer from a statistical model of training data, a significantly improved distance function for use in pattern recognition.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings CVPR IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/3776/11029/00517076.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"216","publicationTitle":"Proceedings CVPR IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1996.517076","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1996.517076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11029","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=517076","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature-based face recognition using mixture-distance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Spatial databases","Feature extraction","Image recognition","Training data","Pattern recognition","Image databases","Nearest neighbor searches","Euclidean distance","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","pattern recognition","feature extraction","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature-based","face recognition","training","recognition rate","nearest neighbor search","training data","mixture of normal densities","mixture perspective","multiple training examples","distance function","pattern recognition","mixture models","statistical pattern recognition","improved distance metrics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/517076/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 June 1996","displayDocTitle":"Feature-based face recognition using mixture-distance","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5329271","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-20 June 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature-based face recognition using mixture-distance","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00517076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027488S","chronDate":"18-20 June 1996","isNumber":"11029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3776","citationCount":"116","articleId":"517076","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":517077,"authors":[{"name":"S.

We present a hybrid neural network solution which compares favorably with other methods. The system combines local image sampling, a self-organizing map neural network, and a convolutional neural network. The self-organizing map provides a quantization of the image samples into a topological space where inputs that are nearby in the original space are also nearby in the output space, thereby providing dimensionality reduction and invariance to minor changes in the image sample, and the convolutional neural network provides for partial invariance to translation, rotation, scale, and deformation. The method is capable of rapid classification, requires only fast, approximate normalization and preprocessing, and consistently exhibits better classification performance than the eigenfaces approach on the database considered as the number of images per person in the training database is varied from 1 to 5. With 5 images per person the proposed method and eigenfaces result in 3.8% and 10.5% error respectively. The recognizer provides a measure of confidence in its output and classification error approaches zero when rejecting as few as 10% of the examples. We use a database of 400 images of 40 individuals which contains quite a high degree of variability in expression, pose, and facial details.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1996.517077","startPage":"217","endPage":"222","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings CVPR IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/3776/11029/00517077.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings CVPR IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1996.517077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convolutional neural networks for face recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Face recognition","Image databases","National electric code","Australia","Multidimensional systems","Computational modeling","Image sampling","Home computing","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","self-organising feature maps","convolution","neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","image classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","neural networks","local image sampling","self-organizing map neural network","convolutional neural network","partial invariance","rapid classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/517077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 June 1996","displayDocTitle":"Convolutional neural networks for face recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-20 June 1996","accessionNumber":"5329272","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convolutional neural networks for face recognition","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00517077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040157S","chronDate":"18-20 June 1996","isNumber":"11029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3776","citationCount":"16","articleId":"517077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":517090,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A promising approach is to view the motion segmentation problem in a mixture estimation framework. However, existing formulations generally use only the motion, data and thus fail to make use of static cues when segmenting the sequence. Furthermore, the number of models is either specified in advance or estimated outside the mixture model framework. In this work we address both of these issues. We show how to add spatial constraints to the mixture formulations and present a variant of the EM algorithm that males use of both the form and the motion constraints. Moreover this algorithm estimates the number of segments given knowledge about the level of model failure expected in the sequence. The algorithm's performance is illustrated on synthetic and real image sequences.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1996.517092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11029","startPage":"321","endPage":"326","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings CVPR IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/3776/11029/00517092.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A unified mixture framework for motion segmentation: incorporating spatial coherence and estimating the number of models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/517092/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 June 1996","displayDocTitle":"A unified mixture framework for motion segmentation: incorporating spatial coherence and estimating the number of models","conferenceDate":"18-20 June 1996","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5329286","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified mixture framework for motion segmentation: incorporating spatial coherence and estimating the number of models","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00517092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075135S","chronDate":"18-20 June 1996","isNumber":"11029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3776","citationCount":"145","articleId":"517092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":517097,"authors":[{"name":"R.T.

However, another important aspect of the polynocular stereo, that is the ability of occlusion detection, has been paid less attention. We intensively analyzed the occlusion in the camera matrix stereo (SEA) and developed a simple but effective method to detect the presence of occlusion and to eliminate its effect in the correspondence search. By considering several statistics on the occlusion and the accuracy in the SEA, we derived a few base masks which represent occlusion patterns and are effective for the detection of occlusion. Several experiments using typical indoor scenes showed quite good performance to obtain dense and accurate depth maps even at the occluding boundaries of objects.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Occlusion detectable stereo-occlusion patterns in camera matrix","publicationTitle":"Proceedings CVPR IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1996.517099","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings CVPR IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/3776/11029/00517099.pdf","startPage":"371","endPage":"378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1996.517099","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11029","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=517099","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/517099/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 June 1996","displayDocTitle":"Occlusion detectable stereo-occlusion patterns in camera matrix","conferenceDate":"18-20 June 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5329293","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Occlusion detectable stereo-occlusion patterns in camera matrix","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00517099.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039836S","chronDate":"18-20 June 1996","isNumber":"11029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3776","citationCount":"63","articleId":"517099","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":517104,"authors":[{"name":"G.D.

Some of the challenges posed by the problem are: (i) patron errors, (ii) non-standardized way of abbreviating names, and (iii) variable number of words in a street name image. A neural network has been designed to segment words in a phrase, a street name in this case, using distances between components and style of writing. The network learns the type of spacing (including size) that one should expect between different pairs of characters in handwritten test. Experiments show perfect word segmentation performance at about 85% of cases. Unlike conventional methods, where lexicon entries are expanded to take care of all variations of prefixes and sizes, substring matching is attempted only between the main body of a lexicon entry and the word segments of an image. Efforts to reduce computational complexity are successfully made by the sharing of character segmentation results between the segmentation and recognition phases. 83% phrase recognition accuracy is achieved on a test set.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognition of handwritten phrases as applied to street name images","publicationTitle":"Proceedings CVPR IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1996.517112","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings CVPR IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/3776/11029/00517112.pdf","startPage":"459","endPage":"464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1996.517112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11029","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=517112","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/517112/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 June 1996","displayDocTitle":"Recognition of handwritten phrases as applied to street name images","conferenceDate":"18-20 June 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5329306","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognition of handwritten phrases as applied to street name images","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00517112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040571S","chronDate":"18-20 June 1996","isNumber":"11029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3776","citationCount":"1","articleId":"517112","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":517115,"authors":[{"name":"S.

We propose a single technique, namely, pattern rejection, that greatly enhances efficiency in both cases. A rejector is a generalization of a classifier, that quickly eliminates a large fraction of the candidate classes or inputs. This allows a recognition algorithm to dedicate its efforts to a much smaller number of possibilities. Importantly, a collection of rejectors may be combined to form a composite rejector, which is shown to be far more effective than any of its individual components. A simple algorithm is proposed for the construction of each of the component rejectors. Its generality is established through close relationships with the Karhunen-Loeve expansion and Fisher's discriminant analysis. Composite rejectors were constructed for two representative applications, namely, appearance matching based object recognition and local feature detection. The results demonstrate substantial efficiency improvements over existing approaches, most notably Fisher's discriminant analysis.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings CVPR IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/3776/11029/00517125.pdf","startPage":"544","endPage":"549","publicationTitle":"Proceedings CVPR IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1996.517125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1996.517125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11029","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=517125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pattern rejection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer vision","Pattern recognition","Image matching","Object recognition","Computer applications","Computer science","Object detection","Pattern analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Face recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern recognition","feature extraction","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern recognition","pattern rejection","Karhunen-Loeve expansion","Fisher's discriminant analysis","appearance matching","local feature detection","discriminant analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/517125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 June 1996","displayDocTitle":"Pattern rejection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5329319","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-20 June 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pattern rejection","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00517125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059265S","chronDate":"18-20 June 1996","isNumber":"11029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3776","citationCount":"44","articleId":"517125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":517132,"authors":[{"name":"R.G.

This analysis is then applied to four particular active contour formulations, revealing important characteristics of their convexity, and suggesting that external potentials involving center of mass computations may be better behaved than the usual potentials based on image gradients. Most importantly, our analysis provides an explanation for the poor convergence behavior at concave boundaries and suggests an alternate algorithm for approaching these types of boundaries.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1996.517145","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings CVPR IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/3776/11029/00517145.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1996.517145","publicationTitle":"Proceedings CVPR IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","startPage":"674","endPage":"679","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convexity analysis of active contour problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=517145","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 June 1996","displayDocTitle":"Convexity analysis of active contour problems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/517145/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5329339","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-20 June 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convexity analysis of active contour problems","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00517145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03473S","chronDate":"18-20 June 1996","isNumber":"11029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3776","citationCount":"3","articleId":"517145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":517152,"authors":[{"name":"Fenglei Du","affiliation":["Amherst Systems, Inc., Buffalo, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Fenglei Du","id":"37344244400"},{"name":"A.

In our scheme, coupling a photonic device to a fiber is basically done by simple butt-joining, which is automatically accomplished by solder-bump bonding the device onto a platform with an optical fiber glued by a ceramic ferrule. To achieve this, we fabricated a 10/spl times/10 mm alumina chip-carrier with a 1.25-mm-diameter zirconia ferrule which had a 10/125-/spl mu/m-diameter single-mode fiber inside it. The alignment accuracy between the fiber and the solderable patterns of the chip-carrier was below 5 /spl mu/m (cumulative distribution of 50%). A prototype receiver module was fabricated using a photodiode with 180-/spl mu/m-diameter active area (bandwidth of 800 MHz@-3 dB). The receiver conformed to the MU connector standard, so an MU plug can be connected by pushing it on. Degradation of the photodiode's bandwidth was hardly seen. Submicron alignment (Ave.=0.5 /spl mu/m) resulting from a 15-sample chip-bonding experiment using 32 25-/spl mu/m-diameter micro-solder bumps suggests that our new scheme would be applicable to ultra-high-speed PD-to-fiber coupling in receiver modules, or to LED- or VCSEL-to-fiber coupling in transmitter modules after improving the fabrication accuracy of the optical ferrule integrated chip-carrier.","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.1996.517369","publicationTitle":"1996 Proceedings 46th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 Proceedings 46th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/3763/10995/00517369.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"19","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.1996.517369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10995","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical module with MU connector interface using self-alignment technique by solder-bump chip bonding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=517369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 May 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/517369/","displayDocTitle":"Optical module with MU connector interface using self-alignment technique by solder-bump chip bonding","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5418133","conferenceDate":"28-31 May 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical module with MU connector interface using self-alignment technique by solder-bump chip bonding","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00517369.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047244S","chronDate":"28-31 May 1996","isNumber":"10995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3763","citationCount":"4","articleId":"517369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":517370,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

This procedure consists of a chip-by-chip alignment step and a simultaneous solder reflowing step. In the chip-by-chip assembly step, opto-electronic chips were successively placed at their optimum positions by passive alignment while keeping the platform temperature below the solder melting point. In the solder reflowing step, all chips were bonded simultaneously by reflowing the solder. This procedure was used to Fabricate a transceiver module consisting of a Y-branch PLC and three optical devices: a spot-size converted laser diode as a transmitter, a monitor photodetector, and a waveguide photodetector as a receiver. These chips were integrated in a small area of only 1.3 mm/spl times/2.0 mm with an accuracy of 1.0 /spl mu/m.

The substrate of this MCM is constructed of copper/photosensitive-benzocyclobutene (P-BCB) multilayer formatted onto a print wiring board (PWB). Features of the developed MCM are (1) a novel microstrip structure for improvement of high-frequency characteristics and (2) a low-cost simple copper/P-BCB process using polishing technology. As BCB has good thermal and electric characteristics compared with polyimide or epoxy, BCB is expected to be applied to high frequency systems. We have developed a low-cost copper/P-BCB multilayer process with a new microstrip structure, and measured the high-frequency characteristics (10 GHz/spl sim/40 GHz). In the process technology, we took note of the adhesion of the metal film/BCB interface. As a result of a study of the adhesive metal and chemical/thermal treatment before and after fabrication of the film, we found that the necessary adhesion force was obtained by N/sub 2/ plasma treatment of the BCB surface before metal evaporation and annealing (250/spl deg/C:BCB cure temperature) after evaporation. Also, Cr was found to be the best material for adhesion. The high-frequency characteristics (10 GHz/spl sim/40 GHz) were estimated by a ring resonator and microstrip transmission line of copper/P-BCB multilayer fabricated on a PWB. Also, the S-parameters showed good characteristics. The developed MCM-D/L substrate has been proved to be suitable for high-frequency systems.","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.1996.517387","pdfPath":"/iel3/3763/10995/00517387.pdf","startPage":"149","endPage":"153","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 Proceedings 46th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","publicationTitle":"1996 Proceedings 46th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.1996.517387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10995","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MCM-D/L using copper/photosensitive-BCB multilayer for upper microwave band systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/517387/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 May 1996","displayDocTitle":"MCM-D/L using copper/photosensitive-BCB multilayer for upper microwave band systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5418151","publicationDate":"1996","conferenceDate":"28-31 May 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MCM-D/L using copper/photosensitive-BCB multilayer for upper microwave band systems","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00517387.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031088S","chronDate":"28-31 May 1996","isNumber":"10995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3763","citationCount":"6","articleId":"517387","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":517407,"authors":[{"name":"Y.S.

In addition, to further reduce design and fabrication cycle times, CAD tools for multimode optical waveguide modelling, and for mechanical modelling of optoelectronic packaging will be employed to aid the technology development.","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.1996.517407","publicationTitle":"1996 Proceedings 46th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 Proceedings 46th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/3763/10995/00517407.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.1996.517407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10995","startPage":"308","endPage":"315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polymer optical interconnect technology (POINT) optoelectronic packaging and interconnect for board and backplane applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=517407","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Polymer optical interconnect technology (POINT) optoelectronic packaging and interconnect for board and backplane applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 May 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/517407/","conferenceDate":"28-31 May 1996","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5418171","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polymer optical interconnect technology (POINT) optoelectronic packaging and interconnect for board and backplane applications","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00517407.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056764S","chronDate":"28-31 May 1996","isNumber":"10995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3763","citationCount":"27","articleId":"517407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":517409,"authors":[{"name":"Sejin Han","affiliation":["Cornell Injection Molding Program Sibley School of Mechanical and AeroSpace Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Sejin Han","id":"37349695500"},{"name":"K.K.

Analytical as well as numerical methods have been developed to analyze the flow during the underfill encapsulation process. For capillary-driven encapsulation, the capillary force at the melt-front has been calculated based on a model for the melt-front shape. A model has also been developed for the analysis of forced-injection encapsulation. The numerical analysis uses a finite-element method based on a generalized Hele-Shaw method to solve for the flow field. Experiments have been performed to investigate the flow behaviour during underfill encapsulation using actual chips and encapsulants. Short-shot experiments have been performed to look at the melt-front at different flow times. Experiments have also been performed to measure the material properties of the encapsulant, namely its viscosity, curing kinetics and surface-tension coefficient. The viscosity has been determined using an oscillatory parallel-plate-type viscometer and the curing kinetics via a differential scanning calorimetry. The experimental and simulation results are compared in terms of the flow-front shape after different flow times. Such comparisons indicate that the approximate model developed in this study is adequate to approximately simulate the flow during encapsulation of flip-chips.","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 Proceedings 46th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/3763/10995/00517409.pdf","startPage":"327","endPage":"334","publicationTitle":"1996 Proceedings 46th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.1996.517409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.1996.517409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10995","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=517409","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental and analytical study on the flow of encapsulant during underfill encapsulation of flip-chips","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encapsulation","Shape","Viscosity","Curing","Kinetic theory","Numerical analysis","Finite element methods","Performance evaluation","Semiconductor device measurement","Material properties"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encapsulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encapsulant flow","underfill encapsulation","flip-chips","capillary-driven encapsulation","melt-front shape","forced-injection encapsulation","finite-element method","generalized Hele-Shaw method","short-shot experiments","viscosity","curing kinetics","surface-tension coefficient","oscillatory parallel-plate-type viscometer","differential scanning calorimetry","flow-front shape"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/517409/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 May 1996","displayDocTitle":"Experimental and analytical study on the flow of encapsulant during underfill encapsulation of flip-chips","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5418174","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28-31 May 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental and analytical study on the flow of encapsulant during underfill encapsulation of flip-chips","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00517409.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03037S","chronDate":"28-31 May 1996","isNumber":"10995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3763","citationCount":"17","articleId":"517409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":517426,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In order to determine the optimal radial power system structure rapidly, we propose a constrained noise approach, which can avoid local minima, with the Hopfield neural network model. For checking the validity of the proposed approach we compare the proposed method with a conventional branch-and-bound method which is popular in the field of mathematical programming. Simulations are carried out for two actual subsystems of Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO). Furthermore, because engineering knowledge is necessary to operate or plan the radial power system securely, we combine the proposed Hopfield model with engineering knowledge in order to obtain a more practical system structure considering cases of fault occurrence at each substation. The combined technique is demonstrated with one of the TEPCO subsystems.","doi":"10.1109/61.517513","startPage":"1529","endPage":"1535","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/11105/00517513.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.517513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient determination of optimal radial power system structure using Hopfield neural network with constrained noise","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power systems","Hopfield neural networks","Power system modeling","Knowledge engineering","Power engineering and energy","Substations","Power system simulation","Neurons","Circuit faults","Power system faults"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system analysis computing","Hopfield neural nets","mathematical programming","substations","electrical faults","digital simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal radial power system structure","Hopfield neural network","constrained noise","connected feeders","branch-and-bound method","mathematical programming","Tokyo Electric Power Company","engineering knowledge","fault occurrence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/517513/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1996","displayDocTitle":"Efficient determination of optimal radial power system structure using Hopfield neural network with constrained noise","volume":"11","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5344749","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient determination of optimal radial power system structure using Hopfield neural network with constrained noise","sourcePdf":"00517513.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028196S","chronDate":"Jul 1996","isNumber":"11105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"15","articleId":"517513","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":517514,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Converging infinite series that usually converge to the exact value have been known for many years, and most handbook formulas were derived from these series, with only the first one or two terms retained. Several approximations with closed-form solutions have been proposed for overhead lines, but nothing seems to have been done in the case of underground cables. This paper describes a complete, simplified closed-form approximation for the self and mutual impedances of underground cables. The simplified equations are first presented and then related to Pollaczek's and Wedephol's equations.

The developed model is based on a piecewise linear approximation of the V-I characteristic of the arc furnace load. In addition to this, the novelty of this simulation technique lies in the fact that the active power consumed by the load is also considered in the proposed load model, thus making the proposed load model dependent on the operating conditions of the load. Dynamic variation of the arc is incorporated through sinusoidal and band limited white noise variation of the arc resistance in the V-I characteristic of the arc furnace load. Depending on the variation of the arc resistance, the developed load model accurately represents both static (deterministic) and dynamic (random) arc characteristics. While static arc models are useful for harmonic studies, dynamic models are useful for power quality studies and in particular, the study of voltage flicker. The results are compared with actual voltage measurements taken from a local utility to prove the validity of the proposed load model.","doi":"10.1109/61.517535","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/11105/00517535.pdf","startPage":"1685","endPage":"1691","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.517535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new time domain voltage source model for an arc furnace using EMTP","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=517535","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/517535/","displayDocTitle":"A new time domain voltage source model for an arc furnace using EMTP","volume":"11","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 1996","accessionNumber":"5344771","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new time domain voltage source model for an arc furnace using EMTP","sourcePdf":"00517535.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048764S","chronDate":"Jul 1996","isNumber":"11105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"114","articleId":"517535","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":517570,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

In particular, most of the progress made in the past ten years, using power electronics and electric machines for VSCF systems, is reported. Two VSCF systems, based on induction and switched reluctance machine technologies, are presented. The research on the singly- and doubly-fed induction machines has focused on VSCF for wind power generation, whereas that on switched reluctance machines has been directly studied as a VSCF technology in aircraft system. Results obtained so far favor the switched reluctance machine over the induction machine. Based on the foregoing comparative review, it is recommended that the induction machine be fully investigated as a VSCF drive in aircraft system. The findings should then be compared with the counterpart SRM system. Issues of comparison may include fault tolerance and redundancy, power density, torque requirements, overload ratings, temperature range and cooling, efficiency and stability over expected operating speed range.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Potential starter/generator technologies for future aerospace applications","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1996 National Aerospace and Electronics Conference NAECON 1996","doi":"10.1109/NAECON.1996.517619","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1996 National Aerospace and Electronics Conference NAECON 1996","pdfPath":"/iel3/3788/11049/00517619.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"82 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAECON.1996.517619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11049","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=517619","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/517619/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 1996","displayDocTitle":"Potential starter/generator technologies for future aerospace applications","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5430626","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Potential starter/generator technologies for future aerospace applications","confLoc":"Dayton, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00517619.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09728S","chronDate":"20-22 May 1996","isNumber":"11049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3788","citationCount":"10","articleId":"517619","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":517638,"authors":[{"name":"Wenfeng Zhang","affiliation":[" ATR Laboratory, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"lastName":"Wenfeng Zhang","id":"37087427513"},{"name":"Songhua He","affiliation":[" ATR Laboratory, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"lastName":"Songhua He","id":"37088031296"},{"name":"Guirong Guo","affiliation":[" ATR Laboratory, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"lastName":"Guirong Guo","id":"37087966506"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3306-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0547-3578"}],"articleNumber":"517638","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":22},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Radar","Target recognition","Artificial neural networks","Shape","Pulse shaping methods","Helium","Data processing","Parallel processing","Linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar target recognition","telecommunication computing","Hopfield neural nets","military computing","fast Fourier transforms","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high range resolution","neural networks","automatic target recognition","range profiles","geometric shape","structural features","real-time data processing","radar target recognition","FFT","Hopfield linear programming neural net","Tank neural net","military targets"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=517638","abstract":"For automatic target recognition, especially on high resolution radars, range profiles are very important, because they can be used to describe the accurate geometric shape and structural features of targets, and can be obtained in a few periods of pulse, and then, the real-time data processing realized easily.

Multiplication in the decimal number system is equivalent to an addition in the logarithmic number system, thus, the use of logarithms reduce the operation of multiplication to simple addition. Multiplication of two binary numbers can be achieved by adding the binary logarithms of the two numbers and then deriving the antilog of the result. The approximate logarithm of a binary number can be found from the number itself through a process of shifts and counting. This is a simpler design process as compared to storing the logarithms on an on-chip ROM which results in complex hardware as the word length increases. The logarithmic approximation results in some error in the product. This is reduced using an error reduction technique.

Modeling and characterization of hardware imperfections is essential before a transition can be made from using CPU intensive software simulated neural networks to practical, electro-optic based neural networks. In this report we study non-linear and limited accuracy components as error sources and experimentally document their effects. The electro-optic neural-network used for this research consists of two electrooptic artificial neural-network layers and one artificial neural-network layer implemented in software only. In the electro-optic layers, light emitting diodes (LEDs) are used to provide the input, liquid crystal spatial light modulators (SLM) serve as the interconnection weight matrixes, and photodiode detectors are the nonlinear thresholding elements. The error sources analyzed include: nonuniform LED illumination, optical misalignment and cross talk within the SLM, thermal drift in the SLM, and repeatability, linearity, and analog accuracy of the SLM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/517721/","accessionNumber":"5436323","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Noise and cross talk study in an optical neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise and cross talk study in an optical neural network","confLoc":"Dayton, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00517721.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038107S","chronDate":"20-23 May 1996","isNumber":"11050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3788","citationCount":"1","articleId":"517721","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":517726,"authors":[{"name":"E.

This problem arises simply because the technology does not exist to produce higher resolution arrays with sufficient spatial sampling intervals. A proven approach to combat this difficulty involves recording multiple frames that have been optically shifted onto a high-resolution grid pattern and then combined together into a single high resolution image. This process is known as microscanning. In fact, if the infrared (IR) imaging system is mounted on a moving platform, the normal vibrations associated with the platform's movement can be exploited to generate shifts in the acquired images. We present an algorithm that can register this temporal image sequence at the sub pixel level and then reconstruct a high resolution image from the shifted frames. The proposed algorithm uses a gradient based shift estimator which provides shift information for each of the recorded frames. The reconstruction algorithm is based on a technique of high resolution image reconstruction by solving a series of linear equations in the frequency domain. In this paper, we review the theory behind the registration and reconstruction algorithms and their limitations. We demonstrate that the registration is a viable real-time algorithm that is suitable for applications involving small image shifts (i.e. less than one detector element). We also show that the reconstruction program gives dramatic improvements in the image's resolution and does well in handling the aliased information.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/517726/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 1996","publicationDate":"1996","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5443092","isConference":true,"volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"High resolution infrared image reconstruction using multiple, low resolution, aliased frames","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High resolution infrared image reconstruction using multiple, low resolution, aliased frames","confLoc":"Dayton, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00517726.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026282S","chronDate":"20-23 May 1996","isNumber":"11050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3788","citationCount":"15","articleId":"517726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":517769,"authors":[{"name":"R.E.

A fault detection method based on the supply current is proposed and is evaluated by some experiments. The method detects 62% of the faulty CMOS SRAM ICs used in the experiments with a small number of test inputs. Also, the total test time can be reduced if the method is used as a pretest method of functional testing.

The language allows analog circuits to be described hierarchically using objects such as transistors, differential-pairs, current-mirrors, and capacitor arrays as building-blocks (custom library objects are also supported). All objects are fully-parameterized and technology-independent, and placement and routing are specified relatively. Hence, circuits described in the language are easily ported to new technologies without changing code. The language is also concise.

This decoder was fabricated in a 0.8 /spl mu/m BiCMOS process, consumes 30 mW from a 3.3V power supply while operating at an effective rate of 200 MSymbols/s, and has a core area of only 0.5 mm/sup 2/.","doi":"10.1109/CICC.1995.518248","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1995 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1995 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/3910/11340/00518248.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.1995.518248","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11340","startPage":"567","endPage":"570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 200 MHz 3.3 V BiCMOS class-IV partial-response analog Viterbi decoder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=518248","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 200 MHz 3.3 V BiCMOS class-IV partial-response analog Viterbi decoder","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/518248/","conferenceDate":"1-4 May 1995","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5161790","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 200 MHz 3.3 V BiCMOS class-IV partial-response analog Viterbi decoder","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00518248.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052422S","chronDate":"1-4 May 1995","isNumber":"11340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3910","citationCount":"9","articleId":"518248","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":518259,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this paper, we describe a modeling strategy for obtaining VHDL descriptions of versatile FPGAs so their dynamic behavior can be exhibited in advance of device procurement. An adaptive system using a versatile FPGA may also be prototyped with an emulation system whose FPGAs are architecturally different from the one requiring emulation. VHDL structural descriptions of the prototype's FPGA demonstrate the feasibility of transferring the model to the emulation system. We show how the generation of both the model and the simulation input capture the FPGA's full versatility.","doi":"10.1109/IWRSP.1995.518588","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Sixth IEEE International Workshop on Rapid System Prototyping.

Fortunately, active emissions generated on-board the AUV provide a convenient reference signal characterizing the self-noise. This paper addresses the use of such reference signals to improve the performance of acoustic communication systems. To this end, two methods of noise cancellation are examined both theoretically and experimentally. The first, called the cascade method, makes use of a conventional adaptive noise cancellation algorithm followed by a receiver with adaptive equalization. The second, called the noise cancellation method, involves a recently-proposed multi-channel adaptive receiver algorithm. It is shown that the multi-channel receiver can operate reliably in a signal-to-noise ratio of -3 dB or worse, a gain of about 10 dB over a conventional receiver for the codes and data-rates used. The cascade method, however, has a performance inferior to that of the multi-channel receiver due to adaptation noise.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Symposium on Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Technology (AUV'94)","pdfPath":"/iel3/3954/11436/00518622.pdf","startPage":"171","endPage":"178","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Symposium on Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Technology (AUV'94)","doi":"10.1109/AUV.1994.518622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AUV.1994.518622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11436","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=518622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise cancelling performance of an adaptive receiver for underwater communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise cancellation","Acoustic emission","Underwater acoustics","Underwater vehicles","Underwater communication","Remotely operated vehicles","Mobile robots","Character generation","Signal generators","Communication systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater sound","marine systems","adaptive equalisers","interference suppression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater acoustic communication","autonomous underwater vehicles","adaptive receiver","active acoustic systems","reference signal","noise cancellation","cascade method","adaptive equalization","multi-channel adaptive receiver"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/518622/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 July 1994","displayDocTitle":"Noise cancelling performance of an adaptive receiver for underwater communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5085586","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-20 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise cancelling performance of an adaptive receiver for underwater communications","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00518622.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.159861S","chronDate":"19-20 July 1994","isNumber":"11436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3954","citationCount":"9","articleId":"518622","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":518632,"authors":[{"name":"R.S.

In the proposed structure, the SONCS is divided into two separate parts: the real-world part, where the controlled object is operated according to the objective of the controller, and the imaginary world part, where the IT is carried out. A forward model network which can generate the simulated state variables without measuring actual data is introduced. A neural network, called \"Identification Network\", which has a specific structure for simulation of dynamical systems is proposed as the forward model network in the imaginary-world part. The effectiveness of the IT is demonstrated by applying it to the heading control of an AUV called \"The Twin-Burger\".","doi":"10.1109/AUV.1994.518635","startPage":"269","endPage":"274","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Symposium on Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Technology (AUV'94)","pdfPath":"/iel3/3954/11436/00518635.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Symposium on Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Technology (AUV'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AUV.1994.518635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11436","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A quick adaptation method in a neural network based control system for AUVs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Neural networks","Control systems","Motion control","Signal processing","Adaptive control","Remotely operated vehicles","Mobile robots","Signal generators","Sea measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["marine systems","adaptive control","self-organising feature maps","neurocontrollers","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network based control","self-organizing neural-net","adaptive control","autonomous underwater vehicles","imaginary training","parallel structure","real-world part","imaginary world part","forward model network","Twin-Burger"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/518635/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 July 1994","displayDocTitle":"A quick adaptation method in a neural network based control system for AUVs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-20 July 1994","accessionNumber":"5079284","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A quick adaptation method in a neural network based control system for AUVs","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00518635.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030399S","chronDate":"19-20 July 1994","isNumber":"11436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3954","citationCount":"6","articleId":"518635","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":518697,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The incidents affect highway drivers and cause traffic congestion, so an immediate and automatic detection method is desired. We think that the changes in traffic average in case of traffic incidents have certain patterns different from the normal case. Our research tries to detect traffic incidents immediately and automatically by using neural networks, which use one minute average traffic data as input, and decide whether an incident has occurred or not. To train the network we used traffic data from various locations where accidents had occurred and not. The former are generated by a micro simulator and the latter are collected by using ultrasonic vehicle detectors. To reduce the number of false detections so as to improve the process of training of the neural network, we added some data with similar average change patterns as observed when incidents occurred. As a result, we confirmed that adding enough combinations of similar average change patterns was very effective in increasing the recognition rate and to reduce the number of false detections.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Neural networks","Vehicle detection","Traffic control","Road accidents","Road vehicles","Pattern recognition","Technology management","Gas detectors","Automated highways"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["road traffic","traffic control","neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","ultrasonic measurement","simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic detection","traffic incidents detection","neural networks","traffic management systems","accidents","disabled vehicles","obstacles","highway drivers","traffic congestion","neural network training","micro simulator","ultrasonic vehicle detectors"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11424","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VNIS.1995.518844","startPage":"231","endPage":"235","publicationTitle":"Pacific Rim TransTech Conference. 1995 Vehicle Navigation and Information Systems Conference Proceedings. 6th International VNIS.

These applications include such areas as real time vehicle dispatching systems where potential routes between a large number of origins and destinations have to be continually updated for a variety of vehicles throughout the day. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of using an artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate the O-D travel time in a dynamic traffic network. Three feedforward neural networks were developed to model the travel time behavior during different time periods of the day: AM peak, PM peak and off peak. These ANN models were subsequently trained and tested using a network from the City of Edmonton, Alberta. A comparison of the ANN model with a traditional statistical model is then presented. Lastly, the computational efficiency of the proposed ANN model compared to two shortest path algorithms is demonstrated. The statistical results show that the ANN models are appropriate for estimating dynamic O-D travel times and are significantly faster than the exact minimum path algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Jul-2Aug 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/518845/","accessionNumber":"5100200","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"30 July-2 Aug. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic O-D travel time estimation using an artificial neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic O-D travel time estimation using an artificial neural network","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00518845.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031082S","chronDate":"30 Jul-2Aug 1995","isNumber":"11424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3948","citationCount":"2","articleId":"518845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":518920,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The training of both identification and controller networks makes use of a decoupled extended Kalman filter (DEKF) update scheme. To the extent that the model represents a real system, the resulting controller may be applicable to an actual vehicle.

It employs only basic arithmetic operations such as additions and shifts rather than multiplications. This attractive hardware property is achieved by restricting the operation at each iteration step to either positive or negative \"pseudo rotations,\" so that the scale factor is a constant. However, because of this restriction the angular error does not converge directly towards zero. Instead, it asymptotically oscillates about zero like an underdamped second-order control system responding to a step input. Multiple overshots may also be observed during the convergence. According to control theory, this kind of convergence is not fast. In this paper, we develop a CORDIC algorithm with a critically damped convergence process by changing the restriction to either.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.1994.519233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.1994.519233","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 37th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 37th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/3904/11333/00519233.pdf","startPage":"253","endPage":"256 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Critically damped CORDIC algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/519233/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"Critically damped CORDIC algorithm","conferenceDate":"3-5 Aug. 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5131052","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Critically damped CORDIC algorithm","confLoc":"Lafayette, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00519233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04593S","chronDate":"3-5 Aug 1994","isNumber":"11333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3904","citationCount":"5","articleId":"519233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":519234,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The algorithm is based on the carry select technique with operands partitioned into very fine slices for quick response. The slice carries, however, are propagated in a multiplexer based structure using a parallel processing technique. The aim of this parallel processing is to produce the final carry terms logarithmically, rather than linearly. It is shown that this logarithmic approach substantially reduces the carry propagation delays as the data size becomes larger, and in fact, for each doubling of the operand size only one gate delay is added to the overall time for the addition.

By changing the weight currents, a programmable DT-CNN can easily be achieved. This implementation of the DT-CNN results in small size of the whole system. This paper gives two application examples (a connected component detector and a hole filler).","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.1994.519278","startPage":"457","endPage":"460 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 37th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.1994.519278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11333","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 37th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/3904/11333/00519278.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Current-mode implementation of discrete-time cellular neural networks using the pulse width modulation technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/519278/","displayDocTitle":"Current-mode implementation of discrete-time cellular neural networks using the pulse width modulation technique","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5131096","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-5 Aug. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Aug 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current-mode implementation of discrete-time cellular neural networks using the pulse width modulation technique","confLoc":"Lafayette, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00519278.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053913S","chronDate":"3-5 Aug 1994","isNumber":"11333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3904","articleId":"519278","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":519280,"authors":[{"name":"K.W.

The main objective in the design of this family has been to reduce the complexity of hardware, and hence make possible the implementation of larger networks for practical applications, by two main ideas: trading time for circuit complexity by a multiplexing scheme and a modular characteristic that allows multi-chip realizations without a prohibitive number of interconnections. In this paper, we propose to bring the various forms of this architecture together, which are at this time scattered in the literature. After presenting the main points in its operation, we will proceed to permutations and trade-offs, some of which have not been published in accessible literature so far. We start with the introduction of the basic architecture. We then present modifications and discuss some I/O issues. Matching neural transfer characteristics is important to the performance of the system and we address this problem with a set of second order improvements. Another version of the architecture, with external weight memory, is introduced which allows interaction with a host computer, and finally, a pipelined version of the architecture is presented that improves system speed with a small increment in overall complexity.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.1994.519281","startPage":"469","endPage":"472 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 37th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.1994.519281","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11333","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 37th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/3904/11333/00519281.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A family of hybrid neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/519281/","displayDocTitle":"A family of hybrid neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5131099","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-5 Aug. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Aug 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A family of hybrid neural networks","confLoc":"Lafayette, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00519281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05184S","chronDate":"3-5 Aug 1994","isNumber":"11333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3904","articleId":"519281","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":519282,"authors":[{"name":"D.

We model the computational requirements of ANN by an m-partite graph called FFCG and show that the mapping problem can be reduced to that of optimally mapping a single (arbitrary) computational layer (c-layer) to the MBS. We present an algorithm which assigns the nodes of a given c-layer to processors such that the computation lower bound [N/sup l//p]t/sub p//sup l/ and the communication lower bound [N/sup l//b]t/sub c/, are achieved simultaneously, where N/sup l/ is the number of nodes in the mapped c-layer, and t/sub p//sup l/ and t/sub c/, are the computation and communication times, respectively, associated with a node in the layer. When computation and communication are not overlapped, we show that the optimal number of processors needed is either 1 or p, depending on the ratio t/sub p//sup l//t/sub c/. We show how the total execution time can be reduced by overlapping computation and communication. In that case, we show that the optimal number of processors needed is either 1 or (t/sub p//sup l//t/sub c/)b. We show that there is a unique arrangement of interfaces such that the total number of interfaces is minimum and the optimal time is reached. Finally, we compare the relative merits of the hypercube and the MBS and show the superiority of the latter in simulating an ANN.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.1994.519283","pdfPath":"/iel3/3904/11333/00519283.pdf","startPage":"477","endPage":"483 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 37th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 37th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.1994.519283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal mapping of feedforward neural networks onto multiple bus architectures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/519283/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"Optimal mapping of feedforward neural networks onto multiple bus architectures","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5131101","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"3-5 Aug. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal mapping of feedforward neural networks onto multiple bus architectures","confLoc":"Lafayette, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00519283.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054922S","chronDate":"3-5 Aug 1994","isNumber":"11333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3904","articleId":"519283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":519292,"authors":[{"name":"H.S.

Simulation tests are reported to confirm the validity of the suggested approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An approach to the design of space-varying cellular neural networks for associative memories","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 37th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.1994.519298","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 37th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/3904/11333/00519298.pdf","startPage":"549","endPage":"552 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.1994.519298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11333","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=519298","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/519298/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"An approach to the design of space-varying cellular neural networks for associative memories","conferenceDate":"3-5 Aug. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5131116","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An approach to the design of space-varying cellular neural networks for associative memories","confLoc":"Lafayette, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00519298.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0475S","chronDate":"3-5 Aug 1994","isNumber":"11333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3904","citationCount":"7","articleId":"519298","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":519299,"authors":[{"name":"P.

They propose a pipelined minimum-multiplier lattice digital filter design method which utilizes asymmetrically scattered look-ahead as in the minimum denominator multiplier technique for direct form structures. A search algorithm selects coefficients for a pre-specified frequency response, as in scattered look-ahead. The result are digital filters with lower order, and thus fewer latches and multipliers. This method does not require pole-zero cancellation, since all pipelined poles contribute to the desired response.

Two different types of spreading sequences will be evaluated. One type of sequence construction will be to use two binary sequences; one for the in-phase channel and the other for the quadrature channel. The binary sequences will be binary Gold sequences. The other type of sequence will utilize sequences from GF(4) which have near optimum correlation properties. The 4-phase sequences have been shown to increase the number of users of a multiple access system by 50% in a Gaussian environment. We investigate the performance of the above sequences in a non-geostationary satellite channel. This channel model for non-geostationary satellites is characterized by Rician fading and lognormal shadowing where the fading/shadowing characteristics depend on the elevation angle of the satellite.

The uplink employs a CDMA scheme to transmit low speed human interface signals, and the downlink employs a TDMA scheme to transmit high speed signals including video and images. The control signals for equalization are calculated by using the output of the matched filters of the CDMA receiver. Theoretical analysis has been carried out to evaluate the BER performance.

For filtering the phase one uses mainly a low pass linear filter applied on the complex interferometric image before evaluating the phase. This paper compares three different non linear methods which filter the wrapped phase map. The first method is based on a morphological filter, the second one is a modified median filter and the third is a modified mode filter. All filters are built considering the periodic character of the wrapped phase function. The characteristics of these filtering approaches are compared, and the number of residues are calculated after each filtering step.","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, IGARSS '95.

However, even slightly different antenna squint angles lead to a misalignment of the data spectra in the azimuth dimension. This possible relative azimuth frequency band shift causes an additional phase noise contribution in SAR interferograms as well as a reduction of the coherence. In the paper, the authors propose a suitable azimuth bandpass filtering method to improve the quality of interferograms and coherence maps. It is demonstrated that this kind of filtering is especially valuable when processing data acquired by unstable platforms like the Space Shuttle. An example from the X-SAR sensor illustrates the achievable coherence improvement.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Azimuth","Frequency","Band pass filters","Filtering","Decorrelation","Synthetic aperture radar","Interferometry","Layout","Transfer functions","Remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase noise","synthetic aperture radar","filtering theory","radiowave interferometry","radar imaging","geophysical signal processing","remote sensing by radar","band-pass filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase quality","coherence map quality","azimuth prefiltering","ERS-1","X-SAR","interferometric processing","aspect angles","antenna squint angles","data spectra","relative azimuth frequency","phase noise contribution","azimuth bandpass filtering method"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.1995.519691","publicationTitle":"1995 International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, IGARSS '95.

By means of a suitable design procedure which is not based on energy arguments, it is guaranteed that the network is devoid of spurious responses.

Network temporal and spacial properties are independently exploited in a manner which generalizes upon earlier Hopfield net optimization approaches. The new spaciotemporal method encodes constraints as a spacially distributed energy and costs as time delays incurred during network convergence. This approach yields a robust recurrent neural network for solving single-source shortest path problems. The approach is suitable for the determination of unique solutions as well as the case where multiple solutions exist. In addition, the new method exhibits better space and time complexity than a Hopfield network approach to the same problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 1995-May 3 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/519884/","accessionNumber":"5099900","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"30 April-3 May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Spaciotemporal neural networks for shortest path optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spaciotemporal neural networks for shortest path optimization","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00519884.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038913S","chronDate":"April 30 1995-May 3 1995","isNumber":"11413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3941","citationCount":"4","articleId":"519884","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":519885,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The correlation of SNM to cell-ratio (/spl gamma/) and power supply voltage (V/sub cc/) can determined the width of drive transistor for a bit cell area minimization. By using 3D simulation, we extract the parasitic cell capacitances associated with storage node, bit-line, word-line, and TFT-load to evaluate dynamic stability with SER simulation. For a typical alpha-particle incidence, we applied an exponential-like waveform on high voltage storage node at three different transient phases such as writing, reading, and data retention periods in a memory cell in HSPICE simulation. The most vulnerable period by alpha particle injection has been found at just after the writing period.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Static noise margin and soft-error rate simulations for thin film transistor cell stability in a 4 Mbit SRAM design","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1995.519919","startPage":"937","endPage":"940 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1995.519919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11413","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISCAS'95 - International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ISCAS'95 - International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/3941/11413/00519919.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=519919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/519919/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 1995-May 3 1995","displayDocTitle":"Static noise margin and soft-error rate simulations for thin film transistor cell stability in a 4 Mbit SRAM design","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5099934","conferenceDate":"30 April-3 May 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Static noise margin and soft-error rate simulations for thin film transistor cell stability in a 4 Mbit SRAM design","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00519919.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030494S","chronDate":"April 30 1995-May 3 1995","isNumber":"11413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3941","citationCount":"4","articleId":"519919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":519928,"authors":[{"name":"Q.S.

Feed-forward multi-layered neural networks are considered as an example, but the proposed technique can be easily extended to different neural paradigms.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1995.519929","pdfPath":"/iel3/3941/11413/00519929.pdf","startPage":"977","endPage":"980 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","publicationTitle":"1995 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1995.519929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11413","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-redundant multiple computation for fault-tolerant digital neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/519929/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 1995-May 3 1995","displayDocTitle":"Time-redundant multiple computation for fault-tolerant digital neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5099944","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"30 April-3 May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-redundant multiple computation for fault-tolerant digital neural networks","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00519929.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05592S","chronDate":"April 30 1995-May 3 1995","isNumber":"11413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3941","citationCount":"1","articleId":"519929","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":519934,"authors":[{"name":"Lu Hong Tao","affiliation":["Department of Radio engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Lu Hong Tao","id":"37087547313"},{"name":"Yang Lu Xi","affiliation":["Department of Radio engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Yang Lu Xi","id":"37087548822"},{"name":"Wang Bao Yun","affiliation":["Department of Radio engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Wang Bao Yun","id":"37087547824"},{"name":"He Zhen Ya","affiliation":["Department of Radio engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"He Zhen Ya","id":"37087453375"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2570-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"519934","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":26},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=519934","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cellular neural networks","Chaos","Circuits","Spirals","Vectors","Helium","Computer simulation","Cellular networks","Neural networks","Nonlinear dynamical systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","bifurcation","cellular neural nets","nonlinear dynamical systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaotic attractor","bifurcation phenomena","strange attractor","three-cell cellular neural network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1995.519934","pdfPath":"/iel3/3941/11413/00519934.pdf","publicationTitle":"1995 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","startPage":"997","endPage":"1000 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11413","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1995.519934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new type of chaotic attractor with cellular neural networks","abstract":"By computer simulation, we detect a new type of strange attractor in a three-cell cellular neural network which defers from that found by other researchers.
