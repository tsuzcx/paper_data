The spectrum of FLPL with an output energy of 23 J was successfully narrowed to 0.7 GHz by this method. A narrow-band CW radiation was injected into the cavity of a small FLPL, then its locked output emission was injected into the cavity of the high-energy FLPL. With a CW injected power of 15 mW, about 70 percent of the output energy of the final laser was concentrated into the same spectral region as the injected CW radiation. The effective power gain obtained was as large as\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4 \\times 10^{8}</tex>\n.

This model makes it possible to derive the locking efficiency as a function of the injected power in an explicit form, and gives an insight for experiments. Some performances of injection-locked operation were studied experimentally.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1070055/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1979","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1979","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"July 1979","volume":"15","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Spectral narrowing of a flashlamp-pumped high-energy dye laser by two-stage injection locking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral narrowing of a flashlamp-pumped high-energy dye laser by two-stage injection locking","sourcePdf":"01070055.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045156S","chronDate":"July  1979","isNumber":"22998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"22","articleId":"1070055","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1070065,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The main concern is whether we can improve receiving power levels to achieve a prescribed error rate by employing a coherent optical transmission system in place of the presently available amplitude-shift-keyed (ASK) baseband direct detection system. The receiving power level reduction in various modulation-demodulation schemes is calculated by taking into account the optical carrier wavelength, data rate, photodetector performance, local oscillator power level, and number of levels in multilevel codes. The phase-shift-keyed (PSK) homodyne detection system requires the least receiving power. The improvement in the receiving power level compared to the conventional ASK baseband direct detection system is expected to be 16-22 dB at the carrier wavelength of\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\lambda_{c} = 0.5-3 \\mu</tex>\nm, 31-36 dB at\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\lambda_{c} = 3-5 \\mu</tex>\nm, and 35-40 dB at\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\lambda_{c} = 5-10 \\mu</tex>\nm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23004/01070400.pdf","startPage":"1251","endPage":"1259","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1980.1070400","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1980.1070400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23004","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1070400","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Receiver performance evaluation of various digital optical modulation-demodulation systems in the 0.5-10 \u00b5m wavelength region","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical receivers","Optical modulation","Digital modulation","Error analysis","Amplitude shift keying","Baseband","Modulation coding","Photodetectors","Local oscillators","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ASK modulation/demodulation","FSK modulation/demodulation","Infrared modulation/demodulation","Optical fiber receivers","PSK modulation/demodulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1070400/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  1980","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"November  1980","displayDocTitle":"Receiver performance evaluation of various digital optical modulation-demodulation systems in the 0.5-10 \u00b5m wavelength region","volume":"16","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 1980","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Receiver performance evaluation of various digital optical modulation-demodulation systems in the 0.5-10 \u00b5m wavelength region","sourcePdf":"01070400.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044624S","chronDate":"November  1980","isNumber":"23004","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"106","articleId":"1070400","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1070425,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Photo-pumped and p-n diode lasers (injection lasers) are described that are capable of continuous room temperature (CW 300 K) operation. The basic problems of carrier collection, thermalization, and quantum-well band filling are considered and have made clear the limits on single quantum-well laser operation and how these can be overcome with multiple quantum-well active regions. The idea that the steplike density-of-states of a quantum-well heterostructure can improve the operation of a semiconductor laser is shown to be valid. Also, it is shown that phonon participation in the operation of a quantum-well laser, which was not anticipated, is a major (even dominant) effect, with perhaps the phonon emission itself in the compact active region being stimulated. Besides the obvious freedom that quantum-well layers offer in how the active region of a semiconductor laser can be designed, quantum-well lasers are shown to exhibit a lesser sensitivity of the threshold current density on temperature, which is explained in terms of the step-like density-of-states and the disturbed electron and phonon distributions in the quantum-well active regions.

Recommendations were made on how the lasing maxima could be blue or red shifted and how the output power and photochemical stability of the new classes of laser dyes could be made to approach that of C8F, which is one of the most photochemically stable lasing dyes reported to date. Because of the reactivity of the nonbonding electrons on the pyridyl group of 4PyPO, hundreds of new laser dyes are possible from the parent dye.

The purpose of this paper is to show that this type of mode stabilization can be caused by the saturable optical absorption resulting from deep-level states or traps, which have been observed in AlGaAs laser structures [3]-[7]. The mode-selection mechanism is due to the spatial variation in the optical loss created by the standing-wave pattern of the single predominant mode. This loss pattern results in a lower average loss for the creating mode and a higher loss for all other modes. It is possible that laser devices with greatly improved single-mode stability can be made by introducing traps of the proper type and density during fabrication.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1070571/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1980","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1980","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1980","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","displayDocTitle":"Single-mode stabilization by traps in semiconductor lasers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-mode stabilization by traps in semiconductor lasers","sourcePdf":"01070571.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056727S","chronDate":"Jul 1980","isNumber":"23011","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"47","articleId":"1070571","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1070587,"authors":[{"name":"P.

We develop our analysis along two seemingly different lines: first, by means of a suitable generalization and reinterpretation of a method due to Kramers, we obtain an explicit analytic expression for the escape time out of the metastable state, which is valid not only near steady state, but through the long time evolution of the system as well; next, we calculate the same escape time by the so-called mean first passage time method.

In our discussion we have made an effort to explore details of both the original Kramers' scheme and of the first passage time method that needed clarification.

The relation of the locking bandwidth versus the ratio of locked laser power to injected power was consistent with the classical analysis on injection locking phenomena reported by Adler [2]. The measured maximum locking bandwidth was 5.8 GHz when the locking gain was 18 dB. A maximum gain of 40 dB was observed with a 500 MHz locking bandwidth. The power increase in the injected mode agrees well with theoretical values calculated with the van der Pol equation. The interference pattern was observed between an injecting beam and a locked laser beam. Visibility was the same as that obtained by the interference between forward and backward emitted beams in an identical free-running laser. Spurious mode suppression was observed when a single-frequency optical power is injected into an RF-modulated laser. Single longitudinal mode operation was obtained at a sufficiently high injecting level.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1981","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1071166/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1981","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1981","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Injection locking in AlGaAs semiconductor laser","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Injection locking in AlGaAs semiconductor laser","sourcePdf":"01071166.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036564S","chronDate":"May 1981","isNumber":"23021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"149","articleId":"1071166","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1071207,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Modulation scheme comparison among optical ASK, FSK, and PSK, transmitter and receiver configurations, single-polarization transmission through fibers, problems in providing stable local oscillator waves, and wide-band photodetectors are discussed together with alternative technologies to realize high performance systems. A study on digital system impairments caused by FM quantum noise of laser oscillators, interferometric FM-AM conversion noise, IF frequency fluctuation, and optical fiber transmission turbulence show the feasibility of the systems. Repeater spacing is estimated by considering the transmitting and receiving signal levels, optical fiber loss, and fiber transmission capacity. Repeater spacing of 240 km is feasible by 400 Mbit/s PSK homodyne-detection system and 220 km by 400 Mbit/s FSK heterodyne-discrimination detection system.

First, we show that there is an optimal input pulsewidth which gives minimum output pulsewidth and, therefore, determines the theoretical maximum transmission bandwidth. Both the first- and second-order dispersion terms are taken into account in calculating the optimal input pulsewidth, the optimal (minimum) output pulsewidth, and the corresponding maximum information rate for given fiber and source parameters. Next, we consider increasing the maximum transmission bandwidth by shifting the fiber's dispersion minimum to the desired wavelength, utilizing the doping and waveguide dispersion shifts. For long concatenated single-mode fibers, we also consider dispersion minimization using optical pulse equalization by purposely connecting fibers with positive and negative dispersion characteristics in series. Lastly, we consider polarization mode dispersion due to birefringence associated with fiber core ellipticity and asymmetrical stress. Based on these dispersion considerations, practical numerical examples are given, and a comparison between the chromatic dispersion and the polarization mode dispersion is made. The practical limit to the maximum transmission bandwidth in single-mode fibers is discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low dispersion single-mode fiber transmission - The question of practical versus theoretical maximum transmission bandwidth","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1981.1071236","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23022/01071236.pdf","startPage":"869","endPage":"878","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1981.1071236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23022","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1071236","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1071236/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1981","displayDocTitle":"Low dispersion single-mode fiber transmission - The question of practical versus theoretical maximum transmission bandwidth","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"June 1981","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low dispersion single-mode fiber transmission - The question of practical versus theoretical maximum transmission bandwidth","sourcePdf":"01071236.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079209S","chronDate":"June  1981","isNumber":"23022","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"72","articleId":"1071236","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1071266,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The theoretical analysis is based upon a one-dimensional relativistic Hamiltonian formulation and is developed in a manner to take advantage of the analogy between the FEL process and radio frequency accelerators. Three promising operational modes are identified and analyzed. The first may be thought of as an electron decelerator and is thought to have the most promise for single-pass devices. Both oscillator and amplifier configurations are studied. The second is based upon adiabatic trapping and detrapping, intended to reduce the spread in electron energy typically induced by the FEL process. The third is based upon the method of phase area displacement. It has the advantage of wide gain bandwidth and small induced energy spread, and is thought to have the most promise for storage ring applications. Generally speaking, it is found that high peak power is intrinsic to these modes of operation. Potential problems from parasitic oscillations analogous to the stimulated Raman effect are analyzed, and some others arising from transverse inhomogeneity are identified.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23024/01071285.pdf","startPage":"1436","endPage":"1468","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1981.1071285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1981.1071285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23024","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1071285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Free-electron lasers with variable parameter wigglers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Free electron lasers","Undulators","Laser theory","Power lasers","Production","Radio frequency","Radiofrequency identification","Oscillators","Optical amplifiers","Radiofrequency amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Free electron lasers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1071285/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  1981","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"August  1981","displayDocTitle":"Free-electron lasers with variable parameter wigglers","volume":"17","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 1981","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Free-electron lasers with variable parameter wigglers","sourcePdf":"01071285.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033786S","chronDate":"August  1981","isNumber":"23024","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"608","articleId":"1071285","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":1071289,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Various approaches to describe the physical processes in FEL's are discussed. With the aid of a general quantum-mechanical description, the probabilities of multiphoton transitions in FEL's are found. Typically, the number of photons that are absorbed or emitted in FEL's is large even in a very weak field. Nevertheless, over a wide range of parameters the gain coefficient in the FEL coincides with that derived in the weak-field approximation. At the strong-field limit, an analytical expression for the saturated gain is found using either a quantum-mechanical or classical approach. The possibility of optimizing the gain in the Compton laser is discussed; this optimization is connected with use of a noncolinear scattering scheme for electron beams with a rather large energy spread.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Free electron lasers","Laser transitions","Geometrical optics","Laser theory","Electron beams","Power generation","Frequency","Electromagnetic scattering","Particle scattering","Raman scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Free electron lasers"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JQE.1981.1071292","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23024/01071292.pdf","startPage":"1359","endPage":"1363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1981.1071292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Free-electron lasers: Amplification, multiphoton transitions, saturation, and geometry","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1071292","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Free-electron lasers: Amplification, multiphoton transitions, saturation, and geometry","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1071292/","volume":"17","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 1981","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1981","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1981","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Free-electron lasers: Amplification, multiphoton transitions, saturation, and geometry","sourcePdf":"01071292.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039982S","chronDate":"Aug 1981","isNumber":"23024","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"10","articleId":"1071292","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1071317,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The lasers tested included the Hitachi buried heterostructure (BH), the Hitachi channel substrate planar (CSP), the Mitsubishi transverse junction stripe (TJS), the General Optronics stripe (GO), and the RCA constricted double heterostructure (CDH). We find that the maximum practical analog modulation frequency f\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">o</inf>\nis in the range of 5 GHz.

An equivalent circuit for the injection laser for frequencies in the range of 100 MHz-6 GHz has been experimentally determined. We find that the isolated injection laser can be modeled by the parallel combination of a resistance R\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">j</inf>\nand a capacitance C\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">j</inf>\n.

The effect of laser mount and packaging can also be included in the equivalent circuit by the addition of series inductors and shunt capacitors. Lastly, all injection lasers studied displayed a dip in the small signal modulation response prior to the onset of the relaxation oscillation resonance. In particular, there is a pronounced dip even for lasers with good lateral carrier confinement at dc, such as the buried heretostructure (BH). Previous workers have attributed the dip in the modulation response as resulting from either lateral diffusion of injected carriers, or the effect of junction capacitance. Our experimental results indicate that while the effect of the junction capacitance may play some role in explaining the dip for the BH laser, it is not the dominant mechanism. We speculate that lasers with good lateral carrier confinement at dc (BH) may suffer a significant degradation of carrier confinement at gigahertz rates. A simple qualitative model is proposed to explain this mechanism and methods for reducing the effect are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1982.1071403","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23027/01071403.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1982.1071403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23027","startPage":"1718","endPage":"1727","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-frequency characteristics of GaAlAs injection lasers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1071403","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-frequency characteristics of GaAlAs injection lasers","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1071403/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"October  1982","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 1982","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-frequency characteristics of GaAlAs injection lasers","sourcePdf":"01071403.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051722S","chronDate":"October  1982","isNumber":"23027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"39","articleId":"1071403","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1071410,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

A GaInAsP/InP BH laser emitting a nominal wavelength of 1.61 \u03bcm was modulated by a sinusoidal current at frequencies in the range of 0.2-2 GHz. The full width of the dynamic wavelength shift was 0.35 nm at a modulation frequency of 1.8 GHz, and a modulation depth of 63 percent at a bias current 1.14 times the threshold current. It was found that the width of the dynamic wavelength shift increases with proportion to the modulation depth, and with inverse proportion to the bias current at a frequency below 1 GHZ.

The dynamic shift of the lasing wavelength was found to be characteristic of the change of the refractive index induced by the oscillation of carrier density in the active region during intensity modulation. The theoretical shift shows maximum value at a resonance-like modulation frequency. The peak height of the resonance wavelength shift is strongly affected by carrier diffusion in the transverse direction, and has a minimum value when stripe width is nearly equal to carrier diffusion length.","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1982.1071553","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23031/01071553.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1982.1071553","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23031","startPage":"343","endPage":"351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelength variation of 1.6 \u00b5m wavelength buried heterostructure GaInAsP/InP lasers due to direct modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1071553","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wavelength variation of 1.6 \u00b5m wavelength buried heterostructure GaInAsP/InP lasers due to direct modulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1071553/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1982","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1982","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelength variation of 1.6 \u00b5m wavelength buried heterostructure GaInAsP/InP lasers due to direct modulation","sourcePdf":"01071553.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041139S","chronDate":"March  1982","isNumber":"23031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"109","articleId":"1071553","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1071560,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Experimental FM responses are measured by using the Fabry-Perot interferometer and birefringent optical filters in the 0-5.2 GHz modulation frequency region. Experimental FM response dependences on modulation frequency, dc bias level, and stripe structure are successfully explained by the theoretical analyses considering both the carrier density modulation effect and the temperature change effect. FM response in the low modulation frequency regin from 0 to 10 MHz, gradually decreasing with the modulation frequency, stems from the thermal effect. FM response in the high modulation frequency region from 10 MHz to 5.2 GHz is caused by the carrier effect. A flat FM response of several hundred MHz per 1 mA is observed in the CSP and TJS lasers, but a V-shaped FM response is obtained in the BH laser. Resonance peak due to relaxation oscillation and cutoff characteristics are observed in several gigahertz regions. Weak lateral mode confinement, strong vertical mode confinement, carrier injection outside the effective core region, and p-side down mounts are effective ways to achieve a flat and efficient FM response with a small spurious intensity modulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23032/01071603.pdf","startPage":"582","endPage":"595","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1982.1071603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1982.1071603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23032","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1071603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct frequency modulation in AlGaAs semiconductor lasers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency modulation","Semiconductor lasers","Laser theory","Laser beam cutting","Laser modes","Carrier confinement","Frequency measurement","Fabry-Perot interferometers","Birefringence","Optical filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FM communication","Gallium materials/lasers","Optical fiber transmitters","Optical modulation/demodulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1071603/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1982","displayDocTitle":"Direct frequency modulation in AlGaAs semiconductor lasers","volume":"18","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1982","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct frequency modulation in AlGaAs semiconductor lasers","sourcePdf":"01071603.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037695S","chronDate":"Apr 1982","isNumber":"23032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"351","articleId":"1071603","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1071617,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The distribution of power among the longitudinal modes of the laser fluctuates and, as a consequence of chromatic dispersion in the fiber, causes an amplitude fluctuation of the signal at the decision circuit in the receiver. The effect is in essence a pulse-delay fluctuation, and the error rate cannot be reduced by increasing the received signal power.

Under usual conditions, random fluctuations of the incoherent source field and mode mixing tend to linearize the system. Previous assessments of the effect of intersymbol interference (ISI) on the performance of digital fiber optical communication systems are based on the assumption of linearity. This paper examines the effect of ISI on error rates in the other limit of complete coherence where fields are additive but powers are not. It is found that in this nonlinear regime and for weak dispersion, ISI may reduce the error rates slightly, whereas strong dispersion augments it considerably.","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1982.1071645","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23034/01071645.pdf","startPage":"944","endPage":"951","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1982.1071645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coherence and intersymbol interference in digital fiber optic communication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1071645","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1071645/","displayDocTitle":"Coherence and intersymbol interference in digital fiber optic communication systems","volume":"18","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1982","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherence and intersymbol interference in digital fiber optic communication systems","sourcePdf":"01071645.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040296S","chronDate":"Jun 1982","isNumber":"23034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"24","articleId":"1071645","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1071656,"authors":[{"name":"Tien-Pei Lee","affiliation":["Crawford Hill Laboratory, Bell Laboratories, Holmdel, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Tien-Pei Lee","id":"37065429200"},{"name":"C.

The second is saturated dispersion combined with a detuning either due to Raman operation off of line-center or due to the dynamic Stark effect.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23037","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1982.1071706","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23037/01071706.pdf","startPage":"1370","endPage":"1375","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1982.1071706","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transfer of pump spatial variations to Stokes phase in Raman amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1982","displayDocTitle":"Transfer of pump spatial variations to Stokes phase in Raman amplifiers","volume":"18","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 1982","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1071706/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1982","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transfer of pump spatial variations to Stokes phase in Raman amplifiers","sourcePdf":"01071706.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030391S","chronDate":"Sep 1982","isNumber":"23037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"14","articleId":"1071706","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1071718,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Almost one hundred percent conversion efficiencies may be achieved since it is not seriously limited by second Stokes production and with the added advantage that the Stokes pulse is a phase conjugate of the input pulse, under appropriate conditions. Due to the characteristically long damping times of Brillouin-active media, the SBS process is transient. In this regime, the tail of the Stokes pulse may experience a gain and loss modulation with the laser field resulting in a breakup of the Stokes pulse. This effect can be controlled by the geometric taper on the waveguide. A practical consideration of the scaling of a Brillouin compressor to high-power laser systems, notably KrF, is presented. Specific compressor configurations for the extraction of laser pulses in the nanosecond time scale are presented, and a survey of some promising compressor media indicate the practical possibility of accomplishing compression by SBS.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1071718/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1983","publicationDate":"January 1983","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"19","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Laser pulse compression by stimulated Brillouin scattering in tapered waveguides","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Laser pulse compression by stimulated Brillouin scattering in tapered waveguides","sourcePdf":"01071718.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047305S","chronDate":"Jan 1983","isNumber":"23038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"78","articleId":"1071718","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1071725,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Most mathematical models of injection lasers are based on time-dependent rate equations that ignore the spatial dependence of the electron and photon densities. The model discussed here is based on numerical solutions of traveling-wave equations. The noise output of the laser amplifier is treated by traveling-wave power equations, but the light signal is described by traveling-wave equations for its amplitude. The parameters responsible for spontaneous and stimulated emission are being related to each other by the requirement that the amplifier achieve optimal noise performance in the absence of internal losses and without gain saturation. The most important results obtained from this computer model of a laser amplifier are as follows. 1) The theory contains a heuristic electron injection efficiency parameter. To agree with experimental observations this parameter must be kept small and its value must decrease with increasing current. 2) Cavity amplifiers saturate more readily than amplifiers without feedback. 3) Because of internal loss mechanisms the amplifier supplies more noise than is required by quantum theory, but its noise performance is still surprisingly good. In particular, the optical signal-to-noise ratio prior to detection is insensitive to gain saturation by strong signals. It remains approximately 4 dB below the theoretical maximum value for weak to moderately strong input signals and drops dramatically only when the amplifier is almost completely saturated.","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1983.1071725","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23038/01071725.pdf","startPage":"63","endPage":"73","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1983.1071725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23038","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer model of an injection laser amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1071725","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1071725/","displayDocTitle":"Computer model of an injection laser amplifier","volume":"19","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 1983","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer model of an injection laser amplifier","sourcePdf":"01071725.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035755S","chronDate":"Jan 1983","isNumber":"23038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"114","articleId":"1071725","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1071726,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Therefore, efficient amplification of ultrashort pulses places a stringent requirement on the synchronization between the pump pulse and the pulse to be amplified. We present a technique of short pulse generation using a dye laser synchronously pumped by a frequency-doubled CW mode locked Nd:YAG laser. Pulses as short as 70 fs are produced. The short optical pulses are subsequently amplified with two different synchronous amplification schemes using 100 ps pulses to establish the gain in the dye amplifier stages. Subpicosecond pulses with energies from a few hundred nanojoules at 500 Hz to a few hundred microjoules at 7 Hz can be obtained.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse amplifiers","Optical pulses","Laser mode locking","Optical amplifiers","Optical pulse generation","Pump lasers","Frequency synchronization","Synchronous generators","Laser excitation","Semiconductor optical amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Dye lasers","Laser amplifiers","Pulsed lasers"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JQE.1983.1071897","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23044/01071897.pdf","startPage":"506","endPage":"511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23044","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1983.1071897","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronous amplification of subpicosecond pulses","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1071897","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Synchronous amplification of subpicosecond pulses","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1071897/","volume":"19","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1983","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1983","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronous amplification of subpicosecond pulses","sourcePdf":"01071897.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032768S","chronDate":"Apr 1983","isNumber":"23044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"54","articleId":"1071897","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1071898,"authors":[{"name":"R.

These phenomena cause electrical shorts in InGaAsP/InP laser diodes, which occur suddenly in devices operated for long periods without any previous symptoms having appeared in their aging characteristics. To completely eliminate such failures, a novel assembling method in which chips were mounted p-side up on semiinsulating SiC submounts using Pb-Sn solder, was applied to InGaAsP/InP buried heterostructure (BH) lasers emitting at 1.3 \u03bcm. BH lasers assembled by this method do not suffer any shorting failure even after 8000 h operation under 60\u00b0C and 5 mW/facet output conditions. The small degradation rates obtained, for example, 3 percent/kh (median) at 60\u00b0C, certify the reliability of these improved lasers. As long as the stripe width of the active layer was optimized to be in the range of\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1.5-2.5 \\mu</tex>\nm necessary for obtaining kink-free light output versus current properties, no detrimental changes in laser characteristics, including transverse and longitudinal modes and dynamic output response, were observed in aged lasers.

The solutions show that the relative powers of the modes change continually during the transient period. Initially, many longitudinal modes begin to oscillate with nearly equal amplitudes which decay at different rates until they settle down to form a Lorentzian, steady-state distribution.

The analysis is based on the semiclassical method in which the optical field is represented by Maxwell equations and the lasing phenomenon is analyzed quantum mechanically using the density matrix formalism. Guided modes are classified by the relation between refractive index and gain-loss differences at the boundaries of the active region as normal guided mode (index guiding), active-guided mode (gain guiding), and leaky mode (anti-index guiding). The guiding loss and cutoff conditions are given for these modes. The optimum range to obtain stable fundamental transverse mode operation is discussed with respect to several guiding factors, such as width of active region, the refractive index difference, and gain-loss differences at the boundaries of the active region. Longitudinal mode behavior is discussed in terms of electron transition mechanism in semiconductor crystals. The relaxation effect of the electron wave is introduced in this model. Profiles of the saturated gain and the spatial diffusion of the electron are related to this relaxation effect. Mode competition phenomena are analyzed, and a strong gain suppression among the longitudinal modes is shown to be as an intrinsic property of semiconductor lasers. The possibility of obtaining single longitudinal mode operation is postulated. Physical influences for stable single longitudinal mode operation are discussed in terms of transverse mode control (or stripe structure), spontaneous emission, threshold current level, impurity concentration in the active region, and direct modulation. Some experimental results are also given to support these analyses.","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1983.1072059","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23049/01072059.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1983.1072059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23049","startPage":"1365","endPage":"1380","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transverse and longitudinal mode control in semiconductor injection lasers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1072059","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Transverse and longitudinal mode control in semiconductor injection lasers","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1072059/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1983","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 1983","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transverse and longitudinal mode control in semiconductor injection lasers","sourcePdf":"01072059.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044478S","chronDate":"Sep 1983","isNumber":"23049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"107","articleId":"1072059","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1072066,"authors":[{"name":"M.

While this is a source of noise, drift, or signal fading in some applications, it can also be exploited in novel guided-wave devices. The basic birefringences that couple the two modes and change the polarization state along the fiber are reviewed. The three cases of uniform, phase-matched, and random coupling are considered. Polarization preservation in both low- and high-birefringence fibers is achieved by reducing this coupling. In addition to polarization-state changes, bireftingent fibers can quickly reduce the polarization degree of nonmonochromatic light if both modes are excited, a characteristic that greatly simplifies evaluation of the degree of polarization preservation in these fibers. Current evaluations of the birefringence and the polarization-holding ability of state-of-the-art fibers are discussed, and it is concluded that fibers with good polarization-holding properties are becoming available.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.1983.1072121","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/23051/01072121.pdf","startPage":"312","endPage":"331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.1983.1072121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23051","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Origins and control of polarization effects in single-mode fibers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1072121","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1072121/","displayDocTitle":"Origins and control of polarization effects in single-mode fibers","volume":"1","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1983","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Origins and control of polarization effects in single-mode fibers","sourcePdf":"01072121.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05335S","chronDate":"Jun 1983","isNumber":"23051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"414","articleId":"1072121","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":1072124,"authors":[{"name":"W.

When the gain saturation parameter is properly chosen, the computer simulated probability distributions agree very well with published experimental results. The following is a summary of the results. 1) Only the longitudinal laser mode at the center of the gain peak shows a probability distribution whose peak coincides with the average photon number. The modes to either side of the central mode have noise-like character with probability maxima at zero photon number. 2) The photon probability distribution narrows with increasing power output, increasing cavity mirror reflectivity and decreasing cavity length. 3) For the photon probability distribution to approach the Poisson limit, the cavity mirrors must have reflectivity near unity and the cavity losses must be very low. 4) Two modes symmetrically located at either side of the gain peak have a probability distribution that is constant from zero photon number to a cutoff value, because the modes compete for power and fluctuate widely. 5) Pulsed single-cavity lasers do not turn on consistently in the same longitudinal mode even if they are biased above threshold. 6) The performance of coupled-cavity (C\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n) and distributed feedback lasers (to be discussed in a subsequent paper) is much better than that of single-cavity lasers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer simulation of laser photon fluctuations: Single-cavity laser results","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1984.1072275","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23064/01072275.pdf","startPage":"1148","endPage":"1155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1984.1072275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23064","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1072275","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1072275/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1984","displayDocTitle":"Computer simulation of laser photon fluctuations: Single-cavity laser results","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"October 1984","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer simulation of laser photon fluctuations: Single-cavity laser results","sourcePdf":"01072275.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037935S","chronDate":"Oct 1984","isNumber":"23064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"36","articleId":"1072275","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1072276,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The traveling wave electrodes are laterally shifted periodically to reverse the direction of the applied electric field within the optical waveguide which exactly compensates for the polarity reversal caused by the microwave-optical walkoff. Consequently, the electrooptically induced phase shifts of each section add in phase and several sections can be used to reduce the required drive voltage at the design frequency. This artificial velocity-matching technique moves the mismatch-limited bandwidth to an arbitrarily high design frequency. In addition, we extend the new concept of phase reversal and the previously suggested technique of intermittent interaction by proposing electrode structures with large inactive to active aspect ratios. This generalization provides increased flexibility for manipulating the total available bandwidth to, for example, allow efficient modulation by a train of arbitrarily short electrical pulses. These techniques are ideally suited for several proposed integrated optic devices, including picosecond samplers and gates, which require strong overmodulation at a single high frequency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1072377/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1984","publicationDate":"March 1984","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"20","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Velocity-matching techniques for integrated optic traveling wave switch/modulators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Velocity-matching techniques for integrated optic traveling wave switch/modulators","sourcePdf":"01072377.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091032S","chronDate":"Mar 1984","isNumber":"23068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"98","articleId":"1072377","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1072378,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

A 1.5 \u03bcm range GaInAsP/InP DFB-BH laser was fabricated by a three-step LPE growth process. We measured the stopband in the spectrum of the DFB laser. It was found that no resonance mode emission occurred in the gain spectrum and its spectrum was asymmetric with respect to the Bragg wavelength. Most of the lasing power concentrated on the DFB mode adjacent to the stop-band which was determined by the Bragg condition. The measured spectrum was explained by the calculated results of the coupled wave theory with external reflectors. The asymmetric spectrum was caused by the relative position of the cleaved facet on the corrugation grating. It was shown that the asymmetric structure DFB laser, which consisted of two end facets with different reflection coefficients, gives a stable single longitudinal mode. There was no mode jump up to 2.3 times threshold. At a modulation depth of 100 percent, the ratio of the highest nonlasing mode intensity to the lasing DFB mode was estimated to be -16.0 dB.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Longitudinal mode behaviors of 1.5 \u00b5m range GaInAsP/InP distributed feedback lasers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1984.1072378","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23068/01072378.pdf","startPage":"230","endPage":"235","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1984.1072378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23068","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1072378","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1072378/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1984","displayDocTitle":"Longitudinal mode behaviors of 1.5 \u00b5m range GaInAsP/InP distributed feedback lasers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"March 1984","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Longitudinal mode behaviors of 1.5 \u00b5m range GaInAsP/InP distributed feedback lasers","sourcePdf":"01072378.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043973S","chronDate":"Mar 1984","isNumber":"23068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"39","articleId":"1072378","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":1072383,"authors":[{"name":"K.

A DFB laser with a window region was found to be suitable to examine the effect of mirror facets. The effective reflectivity of a window structure was calculated to be very small, typically as small as 0.03 percent for a few tens of micrometers of the window region. These small effective reflectivities were experimentally confirmed. Three kinds of DFB lasers, i.e., a double-window (DW), a single-window (SW), and a Fabry-Perot (FP), were discussed. Two modes with a separation corresponding to a so-called stopband appeared in a DW-DFB laser, in which almost no reflection at both ends was estimated. On the other hand, the threshold and the resonant wavelength of an SW- and an FP-DFB laser were found to be sensitive to the phases of corrugation at the facets. It turned out, however, that the mirror facet contributed to the single-mode operation due to an asymmetric resonant spectrum and to the reduction in the threshold. Although a low-threshold-current FP-DFB laser was experimentally obtained, the coincidence between the gain peak and the Bragg wavelengths was essential in this type. The SW-DFB laser seemed the most promising among the three types in terms of the stability of the single-mode operation.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1984.1072383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23068","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23068/01072383.pdf","endPage":"245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of mirror facets on lasing characteristics of distributed feedback InGaAsP/InP laser diodes at 1.5 \u00b5m range","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1984.1072383","startPage":"236","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1072383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1984","displayDocTitle":"Effect of mirror facets on lasing characteristics of distributed feedback InGaAsP/InP laser diodes at 1.5 \u00b5m range","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1072383/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"March 1984","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"20","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of mirror facets on lasing characteristics of distributed feedback InGaAsP/InP laser diodes at 1.5 \u00b5m range","sourcePdf":"01072383.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02839S","chronDate":"Mar 1984","isNumber":"23068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"82","articleId":"1072383","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1072393,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Moreover, this technique is proved to be able to provide a pulse compression rate larger than 14, even for a broad-band laser, which is impossible with backward Raman amplification. This technique could be used with any laser, even with absorbing laser media (excimer lasers) provided pump energy is stored in the lossless cavity by shifting of the laser frequency with any nonlinear process.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse compression methods","Stimulated emission","Pulse amplifiers","Optical pulses","Pump lasers","Optical pulse compression","Laser fusion","Frequency","Raman scattering","Laser excitation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Laser amplifiers","Optical pulse compression","Raman lasers"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JQE.1984.1072460","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23072/01072460.pdf","startPage":"786","endPage":"796","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23072","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1984.1072460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-efficiency pulse compression with intracavity Raman amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1072460","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-efficiency pulse compression with intracavity Raman amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1072460/","volume":"20","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1984","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1984","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-efficiency pulse compression with intracavity Raman amplifiers","sourcePdf":"01072460.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029995S","chronDate":"Jul 1984","isNumber":"23072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"7","articleId":"1072460","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1072464,"authors":[{"name":"M.

First, we analyze the electronic dipole moment in quantum-well structures. The dipole moment for the TE mode in quantum-well structures is found to be about 1.5 times larger at the subband edges than that of conventional double heterostructures. Also obtained is the difference of the dipole moment between TE and TM modes, which results in the gain difference between these modes. Then we derive the linear gain taking into account the intraband relaxation. As an example, we applied this analysis to GaInAs/InP quantum-well lasers. It is shown that the effects of the intraband relaxation are 1) shift of the gain peak toward shorter wavelength with increasing injected carrier density even in quantum-well structures, 2) increase of the gain-spectrum width due to the softening of the profile, and 3) reduction in the maximum gain by 30-40 percent.

Linear light output to greater than 13 mW per facet and well-behaved threshold-temperature dependence were achieved. A conformal mapping technique has been used to calculate the voltage distribution in the laser mesa. The forward-bias voltage thus obtained for the InP pn homojunctions in the transported regions is shown to be capable of resulting in the sublinear dependence of light output on current observed in lasers with lightly p-doped cap layers.

Instability is related to jumps of the laser frequency between external cavity modes (frequency bistability) or to feedback-induced intensity pulsations due to the carrier density dependence of the refractive index. The limit of bistability is derived from the steady-state solutions of the rate equations and the intensity pulsation limit is obtained from a small-signal analysis. This analysis also gives the location of zeros in the system determinant and the resulting FM noise spectrum.

Further investigation shows that the excess spontaneous emission excitation at thermal equilibrium is cancelled by the excitations in the other modes which are correlated with that in the fundamental mode. In a medium with gain, cancellation also occurs in a short amplifier in which there is no gain discrimination among modes. The \"excess spontaneous emission factor\" is fully present only in a system in which the different higher order modes have an appreciably smaller gain than the lowest order mode, a high gain amplifier. An analysis of the signal-to-noise ratio of a high gain amplifier reveals that the excess noise factor can be fully compensated by proper input excitation by a lens arrangement. The lens arrangement provides the signal with an \"excess gain\" factor. An \"excess gain\" factor is also present when a thermal source is used.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1072528/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"January 1985","volume":"21","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the \"Excess spontaneous emission factor\" in gain-guided laser amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the \"Excess spontaneous emission factor\" in gain-guided laser amplifiers","sourcePdf":"01072528.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027754S","chronDate":"Jan 1985","isNumber":"23075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"99","articleId":"1072528","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":1072543,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Transient response and steady-state fluctuations are calculated from a rate-equation model. New approximate analytical expressions are given to make possible the calculation of 1) the critical gain-loss term and 2) the consequent laser characteristics. It is shown that a very small side-mode loss difference increases the coupling between the carrier density and the main-mode photons. This produces very fast transient response. It is also shown that the larger bandgap region smoothens the output power and enhances the main-mode power at constant driving current.

Here we review performance achievements for a variety of pulsed and CW laser configurations including single-mode, multimode, and mode-locked resonators, high-power amplifiers, and zig-zag slabs. In these configurations, operating performance levels have been demonstrated that are comparable to those of older, more familiar solid-state laser technologies.

This results in there being a distinct difference in attenuation characteristics for the two main laser emission bands centered at 9.6 and 10.6 \u03bcm, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1985.1072552","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23076/01072552.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23076","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1985.1072552","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","startPage":"1722","endPage":"1727","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dispersion phenomena in hollow alumina waveguides","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1072552","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"October  1985","displayDocTitle":"Dispersion phenomena in hollow alumina waveguides","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1072552/","volume":"21","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"October 1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dispersion phenomena in hollow alumina waveguides","sourcePdf":"01072552.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037753S","chronDate":"October  1985","isNumber":"23076","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"22","articleId":"1072552","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1072555,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The relationship between the electric field amplitudes on the respective boundaries of the film leads to an elegant analysis that results in physical quantities being derived without a quantitative knowledge of the nonlinear fields. Guided and surface waves are precisely differentiated from each other, and it is shown that the linear cutoff criterion generalizes, when nonlinearity is added, to a novel changeover condition. The nonlinear eigenvalue equations are used to give the guided/surface mode index in terms of the optical power density at one of the interfaces. The power flow down the guide is then calculated both as a function of the interfacial optical power density and as a function of the mode index. These are shown to lead to two different sets of dispersion curves labeled with power flow down the guide or the optical power density at the interface. Finally, by assuming that the nonlinear media are lossy, optical hysteresis is shown to be possible.","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1985.1072568","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23076/01072568.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23076","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1985.1072568","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","startPage":"1701","endPage":"1713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"S-polarized waves in a thin dielectric film asymmetrically bounded by optically nonlinear media","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1072568","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1985","displayDocTitle":"S-polarized waves in a thin dielectric film asymmetrically bounded by optically nonlinear media","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1072568/","volume":"21","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"October 1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"S-polarized waves in a thin dielectric film asymmetrically bounded by optically nonlinear media","sourcePdf":"01072568.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044108S","chronDate":"Oct 1985","isNumber":"23076","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"93","articleId":"1072568","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1072575,"authors":[{"name":"K.

To account for the diffraction losses present in a real dye laser oscillator, appropriate feedback factors for the laser and ASE photon fluxes were introduced into the boundary conditions for the oscillator. These theoretical results have been substantiated by experimental measurements of ASE in a narrow-band pulsed dye laser oscillator.

This mode can become the lasing mode in a laser having one high reflecting and one low reflecting end. We have quantitatively compared the properties of such a laser to more conventional DFB lasers having two uncoated cleaved facets or one uncoated and one low reflecting facet. This comparison required computing a distribution of properties for each laser design because the phases of the two end reflections have random values. The gap mode is inherently compact, and the laser favoring this mode has extremely high single-mode selectivity, excellent quantum efficiency, and good resistance to external reflections, when only one Bragg length long. The conventional laser designs have less mode selectivity and require cavity lengths of about two Bragg lengths to reach their optimum performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23078/01072611.pdf","startPage":"1913","endPage":"1918","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1985.1072611","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1985.1072611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23078","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1072611","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of distributed feedback lasers designed to favor the energy gap mode","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distributed feedback devices","Laser feedback","Laser modes","Optical design","Gratings","Laser theory","Optical reflection","Optical propagation","Distributed computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Distributed feedback (DFB) lasers","Laser modes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1072611/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1985","displayDocTitle":"Performance of distributed feedback lasers designed to favor the energy gap mode","volume":"21","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of distributed feedback lasers designed to favor the energy gap mode","sourcePdf":"01072611.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031644S","chronDate":"Dec 1985","isNumber":"23078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"57","articleId":"1072611","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1072612,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The implications of low facet reflectivities are explored in some detail. For reflectivities below about 1 percent, the increased spontaneous emission imposes more stringent limits on current density than realized hitherto. If thermal runaway is to be avoided and gains in the range of 20-30 dB are to be achieved without excessive currents, then facet reflectivities on the order of 0.1-1 percent are probably optimal. Another consequence of including the spectral dependence is that wavelengths longer than that corresponding to the unsaturated gain peak are predicted to experience enhanced amplification at high input powers by comparison to shorter wavelengths.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stimulated emission","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Optical amplifiers","Predictive models","Reflectivity","Spontaneous emission","Laser modes","Semiconductor lasers","Optical materials","Semiconductor materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Laser amplifiers","Semiconductor lasers"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JQE.1985.1072709","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23083/01072709.pdf","startPage":"609","endPage":"613","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23083","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1985.1072709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance predictions from a new optical amplifier model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1072709","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance predictions from a new optical amplifier model","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1072709/","volume":"21","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1985","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1985","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance predictions from a new optical amplifier model","sourcePdf":"01072709.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032268S","chronDate":"Jun 1985","isNumber":"23083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"64","articleId":"1072709","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1072725,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The theoretical analysis takes into account the dependence of refractive index on the carrier density expressed by the linewidth enhancement factor \u03b1. Locking conditions and dynamic stability are analyzed. The nonzero value of \u03b1 results in an increased locking bandwidth, where only part of the range corresponds to a dynamically stable state. Asymmetric characteristics are obtained for the locked power and phase as a function of frequency detuning between the master and slave laser. Outside the stable range, light injection gives rise to beat phenomena and intensity pulsations. The theoretical results were confirmed by experiments on 830 nm CSP lasers and 1.3 \u03bcm BH lasers. The experiments include the first measurements of locking bandwidth characteristics reported for 1.3 \u03bcm lasers. Power spectra are recorded under locked and near-locked conditions and compared with theory. The 1.3 \u03bcm lasers are found to have a better dynamic stability than 830 nm lasers.

It is found that random switching between lasing modes and output power differences in those modes cause mode-hopping noise. An effective method to suppress such mode-hopping noise is proposed. High Te doping to an n-type GaAlAs cladding layer completely suppresses the noise. Te in GaAlAs forms a DX center that acts as a saturable absorber. This property stabilizes the laser mode and prevents mode competition. The minimum loss difference between lasing and nonlasing modes to suppress mode-hopping noise is also discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23085/01072788.pdf","startPage":"1264","endPage":"1270","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1985.1072788","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1985.1072788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23085","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1072788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mode-hopping noise in index-guided semiconductor lasers and its reduction by saturable absorbers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Semiconductor device noise","Laser modes","Laser noise","Semiconductor lasers","Tellurium","Power semiconductor switches","Power generation","Semiconductor device doping","Laser stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gallium materials/devices","Laser absorbers","Laser noise","Semiconductor defects"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1072788/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1985","displayDocTitle":"Mode-hopping noise in index-guided semiconductor lasers and its reduction by saturable absorbers","volume":"21","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mode-hopping noise in index-guided semiconductor lasers and its reduction by saturable absorbers","sourcePdf":"01072788.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03147S","chronDate":"Aug 1985","isNumber":"23085","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"35","articleId":"1072788","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1072813,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Consistent with this prediction, the hysteretic cyclotron resonance of a trapped single electron in vacuum has recently been experimentally observed by Gabrielse et al. A preliminary estimate shows that their experimental results are consistent with the relativistic nature of the observed hysteresis. In this paper we consider this phenomenon as ultimate bistability since it is based on the most fundamental mechanism of nonlinearity (the relativistic mass-effect), involves the interaction of an EM wave with the simplest single elementary particle, and exhibits the first known intrinsic bistability with no macroscopic optical feedback. We also show that a hysteretic resonance of a Single electron based on relativistic effects is feasible also in a parabolic potential (with no magnetic field required to attain a resonance).","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1985.1072813","startPage":"1544","endPage":"1549","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23086/01072813.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1985.1072813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultimate bistability: Hysteretic resonance of a slightly-relativistic electron","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hysteresis","Resonance","Cyclotrons","Electron traps","Optical microscopy","Nonlinear optics","Optical feedback","Optical signal processing","Frequency","Kinetic energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bistability, optical","Cyclotron resonance","Optical bistability","Relativistic effects"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1072813/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1985","displayDocTitle":"Ultimate bistability: Hysteretic resonance of a slightly-relativistic electron","volume":"21","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultimate bistability: Hysteretic resonance of a slightly-relativistic electron","sourcePdf":"01072813.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042114S","chronDate":"Sep 1985","isNumber":"23086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"10","articleId":"1072813","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1072821,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Four modes of operation are demonstrated: 1) optical bistability, 2) electrical bistability, 3) simultaneous optical and electronic self-oscillation, and 4) self-linearized modulation and optical level shifting. All of these can be observed at room-temperature with a CW laser diode as the light source. Bistability can be observed with 18 nW of incident power, or with 30 ns switching time at 1.6 mW with a reciprocal relation between switching power and speed. We also now report bistability with low electrical bias voltages (e.g., 2 V) using a constant current load. Negative resistance self-oscillation is observed with an inductive load; this imposes a self-modulation on the transmitted optical beam. With current bias, self-linearized modulation is obtained, with absorbed optical power linearly proportional to current. This is extended to demonstrate light-by-light modulation and incoherent-to-incoherent conversion using a separate photodiode. The nature of the optoelectronic feedback underlying the operation of the devices is discussed, and the physical mechanisms which give rise to the very low optical switching energy (\u223c4 fJ/ \u03bcm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) are discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1072821/","volume":"21","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The quantum well self-electrooptic effect device: Optoelectronic bistability and oscillation, and self-linearized modulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The quantum well self-electrooptic effect device: Optoelectronic bistability and oscillation, and self-linearized modulation","sourcePdf":"01072821.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039235S","chronDate":"Sep 1985","isNumber":"23086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"451","articleId":"1072821","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1072823,"authors":[{"name":"E.

We introduce an alternative technique which describes the phase branches analytically and yields accurate closed-form expressions for the reflected pulse amplitude in terms of complementary error functions having real or complex arguments.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23087/01072856.pdf","startPage":"186","endPage":"191","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1986.1072856","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1986.1072856","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23087","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1072856","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reflection of femtosecond optical pulses from multiple-layer dielectric mirrors--Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical reflection","Ultrafast optics","Optical pulses","Dielectrics","Mirrors","Dispersion","Optical pulse generation","Optical pulse shaping","Free electron lasers","Reflectivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Optical pulses","Optical reflection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1072856/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1986","displayDocTitle":"Reflection of femtosecond optical pulses from multiple-layer dielectric mirrors--Analysis","volume":"22","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"January 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reflection of femtosecond optical pulses from multiple-layer dielectric mirrors--Analysis","sourcePdf":"01072856.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06058S","chronDate":"Jan 1986","isNumber":"23087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"13","articleId":"1072856","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1072858,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The bandwidth limitation by gain dispersion is partially overcome by spectral broadening via the nonlinear index medium. We have found that the pulse shortening in an actively mode-locked system is limited to roughly a factor of 2 by the onset of an instability which occurs when an excessive amount of nonlinear medium is added. The instability appears as an oscillation in the pulse shape and energy. The study suggests that active mode locking of Nd YAG lasers could be improved by such means. It is also likely that the colliding pulse mode-locked system is affected by nonlinear index processes.

The phenomena of high-frequency noise (1-5 GHz), low-frequency noise (< 100 MHz), and intensity fluctuations are shown to have a common physical origin in the unusual instability of the coupled laser-external cavity system. After a randomly occurring light intensity drop, the light output recovers in 10-15 steps, each corresponding to an external cavity roundtrip (high-frequency noise); the total recovery time corresponds to the low-frequency noise. The instability, and the subsequent noise, can be suppressed under conditions of very strong feedback such as obtained for lasers with anti-reflection-coated facets. The reflection noise characteristics are shown to be largely independent of the laser structure and structure modifications such as distributed feedback.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23091/01072947.pdf","startPage":"286","endPage":"293","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1986.1072947","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1986.1072947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1072947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reflection noise in index-guided InGaAsP lasers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical reflection","Acoustic reflection","Laser noise","Laser feedback","Semiconductor device noise","Low-frequency noise","Laser modes","Laser theory","Distributed feedback devices","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gallium materials/lasers","Laser noise","Optical feedback"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1072947/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1986","displayDocTitle":"Reflection noise in index-guided InGaAsP lasers","volume":"22","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"February 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reflection noise in index-guided InGaAsP lasers","sourcePdf":"01072947.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063826S","chronDate":"Feb 1986","isNumber":"23091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"76","articleId":"1072947","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1072954,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We predict several properties that agree with recent experimental observations: 1) the instability only occurs when the laser reaches a steady state that maximizes coherent feedback and laser light intensity; 2) the instability vanishes at strong feedback levels; and 3) at moderate feedback levels, the laser will be nearly stable at threshold, but unstable when operated well above threshold.

Even a small amount of bending is observed to have a significantly detrimental effect on both transmission and mode output. The results are presented and compared to theoretical predictions. One interesting conclusion of the work is that as the waveguide is bent, coupling of optical energy occurs from the fundamental waveguide mode into higher order modes which have lower attenuation in the curved waveguide. The result is that higher transmission is measured than would have been predicted based on the sole existence of the fundamental mode.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23094/01073015.pdf","startPage":"718","endPage":"722","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1986.1073015","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1986.1073015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23094","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1073015","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission characteristics of a curved hollow silica waveguide at 10.6 \u00b5m","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon compounds","Hollow waveguides","Optical waveguides","Waveguide lasers","Laser radar","Laser modes","Optical waveguide theory","Laser stability","Optical transmitters","Radar detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Optical fiber mechanical factors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1073015/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1986","displayDocTitle":"Transmission characteristics of a curved hollow silica waveguide at 10.6 \u00b5m","volume":"22","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission characteristics of a curved hollow silica waveguide at 10.6 \u00b5m","sourcePdf":"01073015.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071805S","chronDate":"May 1986","isNumber":"23094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"14","articleId":"1073015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1073020,"authors":[{"name":"H.

A heterodyne detection scheme was used to measure the gain and noise properties relevant to coherent communication applications. Measurements were made with the amplifier operating in unsaturated, saturated, and injection-locked regimes. Unsaturated internal gain as high as 29 dB was measured with the amplifier operating close to threshold. Measured signal-to-noise ratios agree well with calculated results and are 9 dB below the input quantum shot noise limit. A degradation in the amplifier performance is observed when operated above or at threshold.

The vectorial and the approximate scalar finite-element methods based on a Galerkin's procedure are formulated for the analysis of the waveguides composed of active or lossy media. By using these methods, the accuracy of the effective refractive index method, which has been widely used, is investigated in detail and the limit of this approximate method is indicated. Furthermore, the modal gain and its difference between the fundamental and the higher order modes, which may be important for the design of diode lasers, are evaluated for GaInAsP/ InP buried heterostructure diode lasers.

To study the dark current mechanism, various metal electrodes used for Schottky contacts are examined. A drastic V-shape relationship between the dark current of MSM photodiode and the Schottky barrier height is found. An extremely low dark current (a few nanoamperes) in the MSM photodiode is obtained by using tungsten silicide as electrode metal. It is concluded that the dark current is a function of a rivalry relation between the electron injection at the cathode and the hole injection at the anode. The internal gain of the MSM photodiode with tungsten silicide contacts is found, and possible mechanisms are discussed. A flat frequency response up to 1.3 GHz is obtained.

The noise in this signal arises from two sources: randomness in the photon arrivals and randomness in the carrier multiplication process intrinsic to the photodetector. A general formula is derived for the variance of the photodetector output current in terms of parameters characterizing these two sources of randomness (the photon-number variance-to-mean ratio for the light and the excess noise factor for the detector). An important special case of this formula illustrates that the output-current variance is directly proportional to the detector excess noise factor when the number of photons at the input to the detector is Poisson distributed. Explicit expressions for excess noise factors are provided for three kinds of photodetectors: the double-carrier conventional avalanche photodiode, the double-carrier superlattice avalanche photodiode, and the photomultiplier tube. The results for the double-carrier superlattice device are new; it is shown that even a small amount of residual hole ionization can lead to a large excess noise factor. Comparisons are drawn among the detectors in terms of their noise properties.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Excess noise factors for conventional and superlattice avalanche photodiodes and photomultiplier tubes","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1986.1073137","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23097/01073137.pdf","startPage":"1184","endPage":"1193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1986.1073137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23097","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1073137","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1073137/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1986","displayDocTitle":"Excess noise factors for conventional and superlattice avalanche photodiodes and photomultiplier tubes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"August 1986","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Excess noise factors for conventional and superlattice avalanche photodiodes and photomultiplier tubes","sourcePdf":"01073137.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061487S","chronDate":"Aug 1986","isNumber":"23097","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"82","articleId":"1073137","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1073146,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Following a general review of the field in the Introduction, in the second section resonant tunneling through double barriers is investigated. Recent conflicting interpretations of this effect in terms of a Fabry-Perot mechanism or sequential tunneling are reconciled via an analysis of scattering. It is shown that the ratio of the intrinsic resonance width to the total scattering width (collision broadening) determines which of the two mechanisms controls resonant tunneling. The role of symmetry is quantitatively analyzed and two recently proposed resonant tunneling transistor structures are discussed. The third section deals with perpendicular transport in superlattices. A simple expression for the low field mobility in the miniband conduction regime is derived; localization effects, hopping conduction, and effective mass filtering are discussed. In the following section, experimental results on tunneling superlattice photoconductors based on effective mass filtering are presented. In the fifth section, negative differential resistance resulting from localization in a high electric field is discussed. In the last section, the observation of sequential resonant tunneling in superlattices is reported. We point out a remarkable analogy between this phenomenon and paramagnetic spin resonance. New tunable infrared semiconductor lasers and wavelength selective detectors based on this effect are discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23098/01073171.pdf","startPage":"1853","endPage":"1869","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1986.1073171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1986.1073171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23098","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1073171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resonant tunneling through double barriers, perpendicular quantum transport phenomena in superlattices, and their device applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonant tunneling devices","Superlattices","Particle scattering","Effective mass","Filtering","Infrared detectors","Physics","Fabry-Perot","Resonance","Photoconductivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bibliographies","Photoconducting materials/devices","Resonance","Semiconductor heterojunctions","Semiconductor lasers","Superlattices","Tunnel devices/effects","Tunnel transistors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1073171/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1986","displayDocTitle":"Resonant tunneling through double barriers, perpendicular quantum transport phenomena in superlattices, and their device applications","volume":"22","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resonant tunneling through double barriers, perpendicular quantum transport phenomena in superlattices, and their device applications","sourcePdf":"01073171.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053646S","chronDate":"Sep 1986","isNumber":"23098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"617","articleId":"1073171","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":1073185,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Using devices with doping enhanced differential gain and short cavity lengths, a modulation bandwidth of 15 GHz is achieved. The parasitic shunt capacitance which often severely limits the modulation bandwidth of diode lasers is greatly reduced by using a 0.4 \u03bcm thick oxide isolation layer and a device structure which minimizes parasitic capacitances. It is found that nonlinear gain saturation predominantly determines the damping factor of these devices, and thus greatly influences their modulation characteristics. The contribution of nonlinear gain to the FM modulation index and relaxation oscillation damping factor is calculated and measured. The nonlinear gain contribution to the damping factor obtained from the measured FM modulation index is used to predict the optical intensity modulation response. Excellent agreement between prediction and observation is obtained. These data directly show that the damping factor of multilongitudinal-mode lasers is smaller than that of single-mode lasers, suggesting that wider modulation bandwidths can be achieved with multimode devices than with single-mode devices.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23098/01073192.pdf","startPage":"1568","endPage":"1578","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1986.1073192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1986.1073192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23098","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1073192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra-high-speed modulation of 1.3-\u00b5m InGaAsP diode lasers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diode lasers","Damping","Bandwidth","Doping","Parasitic capacitance","Gain measurement","Nonlinear optical devices","Nonlinear optics","Optical modulation","Optical saturation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gallium materials/lasers","Optical modulation/demodulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1073192/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1986","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-high-speed modulation of 1.3-\u00b5m InGaAsP diode lasers","volume":"22","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-high-speed modulation of 1.3-\u00b5m InGaAsP diode lasers","sourcePdf":"01073192.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050257S","chronDate":"Sep 1986","isNumber":"23098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"63","articleId":"1073192","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1073195,"authors":[{"name":"F.

After introducing the definition of \u03b1 and discussing its dependence on carrier concentration, photon energy, and temperature, we give a short historical summary on how the concept of \u03b1 evolved over the past two decades. This is followed by a discussion of \u03b1 dependence on device structure in gain-guided and subdimensional lasers (quantum wells and quantum wires).

The internal surface of isolated arteries with or without atherosclerosis is irradiated with an argon ion laser (458 nm) and the peak intensity of the excited autofluorescence spectrum is related to the composition of the arterial wall. The higher autofluorescence intensity in the range between approximately 480 and 630 nm for grossly calcified tissue compared to normal or noncalcified atherosclerotic tissue is used to produce maps of the arterial wall. These images delineate the calcified areas of the sample with good spatial resolution. If this technique can be adapted to the endoscopic visualization of arteries in vivo (angios, Copy), it could become an important tool for the diagnosis of atherosclerosis and for the monitoring of atheroma ablation during laser angioplasty.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1073221/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1987","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Autofluorescence maps of atherosclerotic human arteries--A new technique in medical imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autofluorescence maps of atherosclerotic human arteries--A new technique in medical imaging","sourcePdf":"01073221.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027314S","chronDate":"Oct 1987","isNumber":"23100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"61","articleId":"1073221","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1073235,"authors":[{"name":"R.

First, it is pointed out that the coupled-mode theory for parallel dielectric waveguides can have two different formulations, one based on the projection modal amplitudes and the other based on the partition modal amplitudes. The theory is then derived by considering the projection modal amplitudes of the total coupled-system field and including the integrated overlap of the individual waveguide modes. Second, the existing two formulations of the conventional coupled-mode theory are shown to be consistent with each other, following naturally from the discussions in the first part. Coupled-mode equations including the mode overlap integrals are written in terms of the projection modal amplitudes. They are appropriate to power calculations and are equivalent to those equations recently derived by other authors. It is emphasized that using equivalent initial conditions is essential for the different formulations to give identical predictions of power coupling.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dielectrics","Waveguide components","Optical waveguides","Waveguide theory","Optical waveguide theory","Integral equations","Integrated optics","Optical fibers","Optical coupling","Councils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Coupled mode analysis","Dielectric waveguides"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JQE.1987.1073250","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23101/01073250.pdf","startPage":"1929","endPage":"1937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23101","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1987.1073250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coupled-mode equations for dielectric waveguides based on projection and partition modal amplitudes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1073250","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Coupled-mode equations for dielectric waveguides based on projection and partition modal amplitudes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1073250/","volume":"23","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 1987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coupled-mode equations for dielectric waveguides based on projection and partition modal amplitudes","sourcePdf":"01073250.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028726S","chronDate":"Nov 1987","isNumber":"23101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"13","articleId":"1073250","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1073251,"authors":[{"name":"B.

This kind of switch is expected to play an important role in telecommunications systems, especially when signals are not synchronous or when signal bit rates are various. The light amplification ratio between a desired main-mode wavelength and undesired submode wavelengths are improved by decreasing injection light power, and a ratio of 8.5 dB is achieved. This experimental result is in good agreement with theory.

Particularly robust locks can be based on combining phase-locking under quiescent conditions with an outer frequency-control loop which takes control when phase lock is lost. Electronic strategies for implementing this process are discussed. Diagnostic techniques to allow characterization of phase-lock performance of optical oscillators are presented and discussed using as an example the phase-locking of a low-cost internal mirror He-Ne laser tube.

We find that Tucker's theory for SIS mixer conversion efficiencies is correct, but that his expression for the measurement noise must be augmented by an amount corresponding to half a photon at every frequency to which the mixer responds. Noise in high quality SIS mixers is shown to be accurately described by the conceptually simpler photodiode mixer noise theory. The radiation coupling efficiency term, \u03b7, which appears in photodiode theory turns out to be the coupling efficiency between the signal source admittance and the admittance which the SIS presents to the LO. Our theory reduces to Caves' quantum linear amplifier formalism, and therefore predicts measurement noises bounded by the quantum lower limit of\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">hv/k_{B}</tex>\n.

The TWA also has a noise figure of 5.2 dB, which is the smallest value reported for semiconductor laser amplifiers. The experimental results are confirmed to be in good agreement with the theoretical predictions based on the multimode traveling-wave rate equations in conjunction with the photon statistic master equation analysis, which takes into account the amplifier material and device structural parameters. Signal gain undulation, saturation output power, and noise figure are also theoretically evaluated as functions of the facet reflectivity. The superior performance of the TWA demonstrates that the device is favorable for use in linear optical repeaters in fiber transmission systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"1.5 \u00b5m GaInAsP traveling-wave semiconductor laser amplifier","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1987.1073403","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23107/01073403.pdf","startPage":"1010","endPage":"1020","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1987.1073403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23107","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1073403","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1073403/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1987","displayDocTitle":"1.5 \u00b5m GaInAsP traveling-wave semiconductor laser amplifier","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"June 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"1.5 \u00b5m GaInAsP traveling-wave semiconductor laser amplifier","sourcePdf":"01073403.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076432S","chronDate":"Jun 1987","isNumber":"23107","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"122","articleId":"1073403","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1073406,"authors":[{"name":"G.

We obtain an analytic expression for the nonlinear gain in multimode semiconductor lasers using the density-matrix formalism. In general, the nonlinear gain is found to consist of the symmetric and asymmetric components. The asymmetry does not have its origin in the carrier-induced index change, but is related to details of the gain spectrum. The general expression for the nonlinear gain is used to discuss the range of single-longitudinal-mode operation of distributed feedback lasers. It is also used to obtain an analytic expression for the self-saturation coefficient and to compare the predicted value to the experimental value for both GaAs and InGaAsP lasers.

An extraction efficiency of 2 percent was achieved with a wiggler having a 12 percent wavelength taper. The beam has been improved so that limits to its quality are now caused, not by injector performance, but by wake fields related to the high peak currents achieved. Limits to optical power are set by mirror damage. Experiments are described that demonstrate the successful operation of an energy-recovery system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1073552/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1987","publicationDate":"September 1987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"23","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Recent results from the Los Alamos free-electron laser","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recent results from the Los Alamos free-electron laser","sourcePdf":"01073552.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083988S","chronDate":"Sep 1987","isNumber":"23110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"15","articleId":"1073552","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":1073585,"authors":[{"name":"P.

It is shown that the intensity fluctuations in the nonlasing modes occur with characteristic times of a few nanoseconds and have exponential probability distributions. We show that the lasing mode is able to follow adiabatically fluctuations in the nonlasing modes in such a way that the total intensity remains constant. Our model quantitatively accounts for the observations of Linke et al. that the frequency of \"dropouts\" in the lasing-mode intensity decreases exponentially with the ratio of average intensities of the lasing and nonlasing modes, and that in digital communication applications a ratio of about 50 is required to reduce the resulting bit-error probability to\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\lsim 10^{-9}</tex>\n. We also account for the probability distribution of the lasing-mode intensity, which was observed by Liu et al to be exponential at low intensity and Gaussian at high intensity. The exponential fluctuations constitute partition noise induced in the lasing mode by large Gaussian fluctuations in the field amplitude of the nonlasing mode. Additional noise sources associated with the carrier density and the lasing-mode field produce Gaussian behavior at high intensities plus a negligible broadening of the low-intensity exponential tail.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partition fluctuations in nearly single-longitudinal-mode lasers","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.1984.1073607","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/23113/01073607.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.1984.1073607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1073607","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1073607/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1984","displayDocTitle":"Partition fluctuations in nearly single-longitudinal-mode lasers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"June 1984","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partition fluctuations in nearly single-longitudinal-mode lasers","sourcePdf":"01073607.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054242S","chronDate":"June  1984","isNumber":"23113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"74","articleId":"1073607","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1073617,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Parallel to the development of long-haul telecommunication systems in the gigabits per second data rates operating in the long-wavelength region is the wide penetration of optical-fiber systems in local area networks, video trunking and distribution, sensors, etc. These diversified applications impose different and often conflicting constraints on the optical receiver. This paper re-examines the optical receiver design in view of these different requirements, namely, high receiver sensitivity, wide dynamic range, transparent to the operating bit rate, unrestricted data format, and fast acquisition time. Design tradeoffs between conflicting receiver requirements are considered in detail. In particular, the sensitivity of high-capacity long-wavelength transmission systems is emphasized. The state-of-the-art performance of photodetectors and low-noise amplifiers is discussed. We show that dark current of avalanche photodiodes (APD's) is the main factor limiting the sensitivity of long-wavelength optical receivers. In addition, as an example, we report on the design and experimental performance of a hybridized low-noise optical receiver amplifier capable of more than 2-Gbits/s operation.

These events are capable of causing bit errors in a communications system. It was found that the frequency of events greater than a given threshold value falls exponentially with an increasing ratio of main-to-side-mode powers and that this ratio must exceed 100:1 in order to avoid a significant contribution to system error rates when the laser is operated continuously and an external modulator is used. These observations are in agreement with recently published calculations. The requirements on mode power ratio for the case of directly modulated lasers are much more severe. We present a calculation of the optical power penalty resulting from these mode power fluctuations.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.1985.1074235","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/23131/01074235.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.1985.1074235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23131","startPage":"706","endPage":"712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mode power partition events in nearly single-frequency lasers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1074235","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mode power partition events in nearly single-frequency lasers","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1074235/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1985","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mode power partition events in nearly single-frequency lasers","sourcePdf":"01074235.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053999S","chronDate":"Jun 1985","isNumber":"23131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"52","articleId":"1074235","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1074240,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The dual-detector receiver is found to offer two main advantages over the single-detector receiver-1) increased performance in the presence of local oscillator intensity fluctuations that might severely degrade single-detector receiver performance, and 2) decreased local oscillator power requirements. These two advantages are particularly important in a communication system which uses semiconductor laser diodes as local oscillators. Such lasers suffer from intrinsic wide-band intensity fluctuations and can also impose strict power constraints on receiver design. Based on the analysis, suggestions for the optimal design of a dual-detector heterodyne receiver are made. Also, several experiments were performed to demonstrate the improved performance of the dual-detector receiver-both for unguided- and guided-wave receivers.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.1985.1074301","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/23133/01074301.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.1985.1074301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23133","startPage":"1110","endPage":"1122","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dual-detector optical heterodyne receiver for local oscillator noise suppression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1074301","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A dual-detector optical heterodyne receiver for local oscillator noise suppression","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1074301/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"October  1985","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"5","publicationDate":"October 1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dual-detector optical heterodyne receiver for local oscillator noise suppression","sourcePdf":"01074301.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082886S","chronDate":"October  1985","isNumber":"23133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"153","articleId":"1074301","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1074305,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The phase of the electrical signal is shifted over several cycles in direct proportion to a voltage applied to an optical controller. The controller consists of a Pockels-type optical phase modulator located in one arm of the heterodyne interferometer. Rapid changes in RF phase are feasible.

The analysis demonstrates that any two orthogonal polarizations may be used to represent the binary bits. The generalized approach also facilitates the derivation of the system bit error rate when polarization errors are introduced. Six types of polarization errors are assumed for the discussion. The various cases of polarization errors are presented as operations on the Poincar\u00e9 sphere. These operations are then formalized in terms of the Mueller Matrix theory. The matrix algebra permits the derivation of the bit error-rate curves for the six polarization error cases. Assuming that the atmospheric-induced fading is log normally distributed, the bit error rate for a PCM/PL fading channel is computed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1074406/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"November  1967","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  1967","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"November 1967","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"3","issue":"11","displayDocTitle":"8.6 - Fading and polarization noise of a PCM/PL System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"8.6 - Fading and polarization noise of a PCM/PL System","sourcePdf":"01074406.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044281S","chronDate":"November  1967","isNumber":"23137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"9","articleId":"1074406","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1074434,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The fibers considered have a high numerical aperture and a protective coating which has a refractive index greater than that of the cladding. For these fibers the pure bend loss is shown to be the dominant loss mechanism over the wavelength range 633-1152 nm. In addition, oscillations in the loss are observed as the bend radius is varied at the longer wavelengths. These oscillations are shown to result from the coupling of light under weak coupling conditions from a whispering gallery mode in the cladding formed by the pure bend loss, to the fundamental mode in the core. An expression is derived which relates the bend radius at which the minima in the oscillations occur to the fiber parameters and a qualitative explanation is given for the reduction in the oscillation amplitude as the bend radius and wavelength are decreased. A criterion is identified for assessing the strength of the coupling between the whispering gallery mode and fundamental mode. Using this criterion the attenuation coefficient of the pure bend loss at which a transition from weak to strong coupling occurs is determined and is found to agree with observations. The effect of the coupling strength between the whispering gallery mode and the fundamental mode on the characteristics of the pure bend loss is discussed. Finally, possible applications arising from the results of this work are identified.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.1986.1074626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23147","startPage":"34","endPage":"40","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/23147/01074626.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.1986.1074626","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bend loss measurements on high numerical aperture single-mode fibers as a function of wavelength and bend radius","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Loss measurement","Wavelength measurement","Apertures","Optical fibers","Optical fiber sensors","Optical coupling","Protection","Coatings","Refractive index","Optical losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Optical fiber mechanical factors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1986","displayDocTitle":"Bend loss measurements on high numerical aperture single-mode fibers as a function of wavelength and bend radius","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1074626/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"4","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"January 1986","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bend loss measurements on high numerical aperture single-mode fibers as a function of wavelength and bend radius","sourcePdf":"01074626.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03361S","chronDate":"Jan 1986","isNumber":"23147","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"113","articleId":"1074626","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1074629,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The EA LM's were fabricated from hydride vapor-phase-epitaxy (VPE) grown wafers. The electroabsorption, the insertion loss, the electrical properties, and the modulation characteristics were investigated for the EA LM's. The drive voltage at a 99-percent modulation depth has been noticeably reduced to 4.5 V by optimizing the thicknesses of the epitaxial layers. The total capacitance of 1.5 pF was obtained by inserting an insulating film under the wire-bonding pad and by improving the mount design. Consequently, a 3-dB bandwidth of 3.8 GHz has been achieved and a pulse modulation operation under 2 Gbit/s nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ) pseudorandom pattern has also been confirmed. Moreover, the dynamic spectra of the EA modulators were measured for the first time. A spectral broadening factor \u03b1 has been determined to be 1-4 from a relative strength of the sideband to the carrier and it has been experimentally found to decrease with increasing the electric field inside the absorptive waveguide. As the other measures of merit for the EA LM's, the extinction ratio over 23 dB and the insertion loss of 10-14 dB including a coupling loss due to an end-fire method were obtained. As a whole, these results have exhibited that the EA LM is a promising external modulator which will be monolithically integrated into a gigabit per second optical source with a dynamic single-mode laser.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.1986.1074650","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/23148/01074650.pdf","startPage":"1445","endPage":"1453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.1986.1074650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-speed electroabsorption modulator with strip-loaded GaInAsP planar waveguide","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1074650","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1074650/","displayDocTitle":"High-speed electroabsorption modulator with strip-loaded GaInAsP planar waveguide","volume":"4","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 1986","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-speed electroabsorption modulator with strip-loaded GaInAsP planar waveguide","sourcePdf":"01074650.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070678S","chronDate":"Oct 1986","isNumber":"23148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"51","articleId":"1074650","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1074655,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Unlike conventional theories of laser noise, this presentation is valid for open resonators. A local Langevin force is added to the wave equation to account for spontaneous emission. A general expression is found relating the diffusion coefficient of this force to the imaginary part of the dielectric function. The fields of lasers and amplifiers are found by solving the wave equation by the Green's function method. The lasing mode is a resonant state associated with a pole in Green's function. In this way, noise in lasers and amplifiers is treated by a unified approach that is valid for either gain guiding or index guiding. The Langevin rate equations for the laser are derived. The theory is illustrated with applications to traveling wave and Fabry-Perot amplifiers and Fabry-Perot lasers. Several new results are found: optical amplifier noise increases inversely with quantum efficiency; spontaneous emission into the lasing mode is enhanced in lasers with low facet reflectivities; and the linewidth of a Fabry-Perot laser with a passive section decreases as the square of the fraction of the cavity optical length that is active.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/23152/01074715.pdf","startPage":"288","endPage":"297","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.1986.1074715","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.1986.1074715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23152","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1074715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theory of spontaneous emission noise in open resonators and its application to lasers and optical amplifiers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical noise","Optical resonators","Spontaneous emission","Laser applications","Laser noise","Laser theory","Stimulated emission","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Optical amplifiers","Laser modes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Amplifier noise","Fabry - Perot resonators","Laser noise","Optical amplifiers","Optical resonators","Spontaneous emission","Traveling wave amplifiers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1074715/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1986","displayDocTitle":"Theory of spontaneous emission noise in open resonators and its application to lasers and optical amplifiers","volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theory of spontaneous emission noise in open resonators and its application to lasers and optical amplifiers","sourcePdf":"01074715.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047995S","chronDate":"Mar 1986","isNumber":"23152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"315","articleId":"1074715","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":1074716,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Key issues in the model are the concept of single realization measurements of a stochastic intermediate frequency, and development of the probability density function for this stochastic process. Analytical results are derived for heterodyne ASK and dual filter FSK receivers and include the shot-noise limit, the asymptotic error-probability limits in ASK and FSK receivers, the influence of the IF on receiver noise, and the effective local oscillator strength. Detailed numerical results for typical p-i-n-FET wide-band receivers illustrate the influence on receiver sensitivity of IF filter bandwidth and relative threshold setting in ASK systems and of modulation index and IF filter bandwidth in FSK systems. A receiver sensitivity penalty for nonzero linewidth is found to be, for IF linewidths of 0.1 to 0.3 of the bit-rate, 3 to 9 dB in optimum ASK receivers, and 2 to 8 dB in optimum FSK receivers. Thus DFB lasers of linewidth 5 to 20 MHz could be used without external cavities in simple systems with near-ideal performance, which could find application wherever the great multiplexing advantage of coherent systems is a prime advantage. We present some guidelines for system design based on the results of this work.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/23152/01074716.pdf","startPage":"323","endPage":"334","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.1986.1074716","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.1986.1074716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23152","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1074716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theoretical analysis of heterodyne optical receivers for transmission systems using (semiconductor) lasers with nonnegligible linewidth","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical receivers","Laser theory","Semiconductor lasers","Frequency shift keying","Amplitude shift keying","Filters","Local oscillators","Bandwidth","Laser modes","Optical fiber communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Amplitude shift keying","Frequency-shift keying","Heterodyning","Optical fiber receivers","Optical fiber transmitters, lasers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1074716/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1986","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical analysis of heterodyne optical receivers for transmission systems using (semiconductor) lasers with nonnegligible linewidth","volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical analysis of heterodyne optical receivers for transmission systems using (semiconductor) lasers with nonnegligible linewidth","sourcePdf":"01074716.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034518S","chronDate":"Mar 1986","isNumber":"23152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"61","articleId":"1074716","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1074721,"authors":[{"name":"C.

They present undesirable transmission limitations for long-distance optical fiber communication systems due to the intensity-dependent loss and pulse waveform distortions. On the useful side, they provide efficient frequency conversion means for generating frequency-shifted optical sources for a variety of spectroscopic applications including optical fiber measurements and optical device characterization. In addition, nonlinear optical effects also can provide useful special optical device functions such as optical amplification, optical gating, optical pulseshaping, and waveform equalization. This paper gives a brief review of the latter two aspects of nonlinear optics in fibers.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.1986.1074853","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/23157/01074853.pdf","startPage":"1103","endPage":"1115","doi":"10.1109/JLT.1986.1074853","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear optics in fibers for fiber measurements and special device functions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1986","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear optics in fibers for fiber measurements and special device functions","volume":"4","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1074853/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1986","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear optics in fibers for fiber measurements and special device functions","sourcePdf":"01074853.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067977S","chronDate":"Aug 1986","isNumber":"23157","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"32","articleId":"1074853","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1074868,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The experimental link consisted of a laser transmitter with pigtail terminated in a fiber-optic connector, 240 m of fiber, and a detector with a pigtail terminated in a connector. Four different laser transmitters were used in the link. Changes in the amplitude and frequency separation of peaks in the noise spectrum due to optical feedback from the fiber-optic connectors and detector surface were investigated. Results indicated that index-matching gel placed in the connector nearest the transmitter reduced the near-end reflection peaks. Gel placed in both connectors increased the far-end reflection peaks when a conventional detector was used. However, these far-end reflection peaks were eliminated by using an angled detector which had a surface tilted at an angle relative to the end of the pigtail fiber. A heavily-moded laser showed substantially smaller reflection peaks and less change in the noise floor due to connector/fiber vibration than a laser with 1 or 2 modes.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.1986.1074888","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/23158/01074888.pdf","startPage":"1285","endPage":"1293","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.1986.1074888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sources of intensity noise in wide-band UHF analog optical communication systems: Their elimination and reduction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1074888","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1074888/","displayDocTitle":"Sources of intensity noise in wide-band UHF analog optical communication systems: Their elimination and reduction","volume":"4","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 1986","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sources of intensity noise in wide-band UHF analog optical communication systems: Their elimination and reduction","sourcePdf":"01074888.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046015S","chronDate":"Sep 1986","isNumber":"23158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","articleId":"1074888","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1074894,"authors":[{"name":"B.

A further improvement is obtained by using a combination of wide-band and narrow-band quantum amplifiers.

Experiments show that such an amplifier with a gain of 24 dB and a bandwidth of 1 MHz is feasible. The incident beam axis can be displaced by as much as ten times the beam-waist radius without losing more than 4 dB in gain. Frequency modulation may be converted into amplitude modulation by the phase shift introduced in the carrier.","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1968.1074977","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1968.1074977","startPage":"893","endPage":"899","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23161/01074977.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancement of optical receiver sensitivities by amplification of the carrier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1968","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1968","displayDocTitle":"Enhancement of optical receiver sensitivities by amplification of the carrier","publicationDate":"November 1968","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"4","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1074977/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancement of optical receiver sensitivities by amplification of the carrier","sourcePdf":"01074977.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032106S","chronDate":"Nov 1968","isNumber":"23161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"50","articleId":"1074977","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1075042,"authors":[{"name":"L.

These oscillations have been measured both in the light output of the diodes and in the dc current applied to the laser connections. The frequency of the oscillation lies in the 0.5- to 3.0-GHz range and depends strongly on current and temperature. The frequency typically increases with increasing current at a rate of 15 to 20 MHz/mA and decreases with increasing temperature at 100 to 150 MHz/\u00b0K. Introduction of an external microwave signal locks the frequency of the oscillation and reduces the oscillation width from 10 MHz to the external signal width. The frequency of oscillation agrees with a theory of intensity fluctuations in lasers based on the rate equations.","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1968.1075042","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23165/01075042.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1968.1075042","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","startPage":"164","endPage":"167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous microwave oscillations in GaAs junction lasers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1075042","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1968","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1968","displayDocTitle":"Continuous microwave oscillations in GaAs junction lasers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1075042/","volume":"4","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1968","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous microwave oscillations in GaAs junction lasers","sourcePdf":"01075042.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033612S","chronDate":"Apr 1968","isNumber":"23165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"45","articleId":"1075042","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1075063,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The separation between the oscillator and the amplifier was varied from 0.2 to 2.0 microns. The amplifiers were made by lapping one end at an angle of 10 to 15 degrees. This angle is several times larger than the critical angle for confinement of radiation in GaAs lasers that is estimated from experimental data to be between 2 and 3 degrees. The measured signal gain is a decaying function of input power and approaches a value of 2 to 4 for large input signals. A maximum amplifier gain of about 150 was obtained for an input signal of 2 mW/mil junction width (corresponding to an optical flux-density of about 8 kW/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\nincident on the input side of the amplifier). At this input power level, the output fluoresence is reduced by about 50 percent and the internal oscillatory modes of the amplifier are almost completely quenched. The ratio of the oscillator output actually coupled into the amplifier to the measured output from the oscillator was estimated from gain saturation measurements. It was found to be inversely proportional to the cleaved separation between the oscillator and the amplifier and was estimated as 0.5 and 0.07 for separations of 0.2 and 2 microns, respectively. The output quantum efficiency of the laser amplifier was demonstrated to be comparable to the output quantum efficiency of a single oscillator. Tests of a new structure for a low-noise, constant-gain laser amplifier are described.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium arsenide","Optical amplifiers","Oscillators","Gain measurement","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Operational amplifiers","Optical coupling","Lapping","Power measurement","Stimulated emission"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JQE.1968.1075063","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23165/01075063.pdf","startPage":"125","endPage":"131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1968.1075063","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GaAs laser amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1075063","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"GaAs laser amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1075063/","volume":"4","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1968","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1968","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1968","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GaAs laser amplifiers","sourcePdf":"01075063.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026702S","chronDate":"Apr 1968","isNumber":"23165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"31","articleId":"1075063","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1075068,"authors":[{"name":"E.

After the final junction between the arms, the outgoing light is proved to carry a part of the amplitude of the pump and the modulation of the signal.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1075489/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"February 1987","volume":"5","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An all-optical amplifier for terahertz AM signals: A proposal","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An all-optical amplifier for terahertz AM signals: A proposal","sourcePdf":"01075489.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039013S","chronDate":"Feb 1987","isNumber":"23175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"5","articleId":"1075489","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1075494,"authors":[{"name":"B.

We discuss the factors that affect the performance of systems with significant laser phase noise. Wherever possible, we compare the theoretical results with published system experiments.

Here a photodiode-amplifier combination having bandwidth greater than twice the bit rate (\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">B</tex>\n) is needed: indeed bandwidths considerably greater than\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2B</tex>\nare preferably employed to ease design of the bandpass filter needed for noise limitation, and to avoid demodulator penalties in some modulation schemes. For the high bit rate systems now coming into service (560 Mbit/s-2.4 Gbit/s), the optical receiver design requirements become more stringent for coherent heterodyne operation. The various modes of \"zero IF\" operation, however, require only baseband receiver module bandwidth. The options available are either homodyne (phase locked) operation, or phase diversity (multiport) techniques. In this paper, we compare these options, and show that phase diversity techniques are capable of good performance for high bit rate coherent receivers. In phase diversity operation, not only is phase locking avoided, but also the necessary frequency locking does not have high stability requirements. Furthermore, there are advantages in operating with a small frequency offset from zero (of the order of 1 percent of the bit rate). An experimental receiver has been operated at 320 and 680 Mbit/s, demodulating both amplitude shift keying (ASK) and differential phase shift keying (DPSK). Operation with FSK is also possible. Sensitivities so far achieved of -47.5 dBm (320-Mbit/s ASK) and -42 dBm (680- Mbit/s ASK) with limited local oscillator power are capable of substantial improvement when higher power local oscillators and lower noise receive modules become available. Demodulation of DPSK at 320 Mbit/s has also been achieved and shows a measured receiver sensitivity improvement of over 4 dB over ASK at the same bit rate and local oscillator power. These practical results show clearly that phase diversity is a very realistic option for high bit rate systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase diversity techniques for coherent optical receivers","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.1987.1075539","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/23177/01075539.pdf","startPage":"561","endPage":"572","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.1987.1075539","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23177","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1075539","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1075539/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1987","displayDocTitle":"Phase diversity techniques for coherent optical receivers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"April 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase diversity techniques for coherent optical receivers","sourcePdf":"01075539.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027564S","chronDate":"April  1987","isNumber":"23177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"90","articleId":"1075539","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1075540,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The simplest structure is the conventional multiport receiver with a matched filter in each branch. This structure can tolerate\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\DeltavT</tex>\n[\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\deltav</tex>\nis the laser finewidth and\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T</tex>\nis the bit duration) of several percent with a small power penalty (3.6 percent for 1-dB penalty and 5.2 percent for 2-dB penalty). Optimization of branch filters of conventional multiport receivers does not help when the linewidth (and the penalty) is small but does improve the receiver performance for larger linewidths. The most important point of the paper is the novel wide-band filter-rectifier-narrow-band filter (WIRNA) structure, proposed and investigated here for the first time for optical communication systems. It is shown that the optimized WIRNA homodyne receivers are extremely robust with respect to the phase noise: the WIRNA tolerable value of\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\DeltavT</tex>\nis 3.6 percent for 1-dB penalty and more than 50 percent for 2-dB penalty. Thus, the WIRNA structure opens, for the first time, the possibility of constructing homodyne receivers operating at several hundred megabits per second with conventional DFB lasers without complicated external cavities. Under no-phase-noise conditions, all the multiport receivers investigated here have the same performance, which is identical to that of heterodyne ASK receivers. In addition, the optimized WIRNA receivers can tolerate tapproximately) the same laser linewidth as the heterodyne ASK receivers. Thus, the main difference between the WIRNA multiport homodyne and heterodyne receivers is that the former shifts the processing to a lower frequency range, in return for a more complicated implementation. This difference makes the WIRNA multiport homodyne receivers particularly attractive at high (say, several gigabit per second) bit rates.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.1987.1075574","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/23179/01075574.pdf","startPage":"770","endPage":"791","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.1987.1075574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ASK multiport optical homodyne receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1075574","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1075574/","displayDocTitle":"ASK multiport optical homodyne receivers","volume":"5","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ASK multiport optical homodyne receivers","sourcePdf":"01075574.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075844S","chronDate":"June  1987","isNumber":"23179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"65","articleId":"1075574","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1075580,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The gain is expressed in terms of time-dependent excited-state populations and spectral emission and/or absorption functions. For a given optical-pump pulse, a computer program is used to solve rate equations for the populations up to threshold and to calculate the gain as a function of time and frequency.

Computer calculations of the gain for anthracene and rhodamine B illustrate the dependence of gain properties on the rate of intersystem crossing and triplet-triplet absorption. An estimate of the rate of intersystem crossing for rhodamine B in methanol is obtained from a comparison of predicted and observed laser threshold conditions. Requirements for achieving flashlamp-pumped laser action are shown to depend upon both flashlamp and dye properties and are analyzed using the above approach.","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1969.1075754","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23189/01075754.pdf","startPage":"175","endPage":"188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1969.1075754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23189","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1075754","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency- and time-dependent gain characteristics of dye lasers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Frequency- and time-dependent gain characteristics of dye lasers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1075754/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1969","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1969","volume":"5","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"April 1969","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency- and time-dependent gain characteristics of dye lasers","sourcePdf":"01075754.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038438S","chronDate":"April  1969","isNumber":"23189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"56","articleId":"1075754","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1075921,"authors":[{"name":"E.N.

This may result in redefinition of a 'second' when optical frequency standards supersede their microwave counterparts in terms of accuracy (J.L. Hall et al., IEEE J.

Here, we discuss the influence of pressure-broadening on the conversion process, and find that when collisional dephasing is very rapid there is a significant decrease in the efficiency of PM-to-AM conversion. Normally, since pressure-broadening increases the linewidth of an atomic transition, collisional dephasing decreases spectroscopic sensitivity. However, the present results imply that when laser PM-to-AM conversion is dominant, pressure broadening can actually increase spectroscopic sensitivity. Thus, under conditions of significant PM-to-AM conversion, pressure-broadening should improve the performance of laser-pumped atomic clocks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1075930/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31-31 May 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1075930/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7473248","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of laser phase-noise to amplitude-noise conversion in the gas-cell atomic clock","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of laser phase-noise to amplitude-noise conversion in the gas-cell atomic clock","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"01075930.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052394S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8135","isNumber":"23191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8135","xplore-issue":"23191","articleId":"1075930","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1075954,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The cascode crystal oscillator is composed of a Colpitts crystal oscillator and a base-common buffer amplifier. In the proposed cascode crystal oscillator, the buffer amplifier is biased by a temperature-independent voltage source and the bypass capacitor of the buffer amplifier is eliminated. Both the Colpitts oscillator and the buffer amplifier use the common divider resistors. We have evaluated the performance of the proposed cascode crystal oscillator by simulation and experiment, and estimated the required circuit area as an integrated circuit design. Fifty-percent reduction of the start-up time and thirty eight percent reduction of the area have been achieved. The frequency stability verses power supply and load impedance is comparable to that of a typical cascode crystal oscillator. SSB phase noise is also comparable to that of the conventional cascode crystal oscillator despite the increased number of transistors used. From these results, we have confirmed that the proposed cascode crystal oscillator is useful and suitable for integrated circuits.","doi":"10.1109/FREQ.2002.1075954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FREQ.2002.1075954","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2002 IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium and PDA Exhibition (Cat.

A novel hybrid scheme, consisting of both look-up and algorithmic constituents, is proposed, based on the VECTORING mode of the COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer (CORDIC) hardware algorithm, preceded by a principal axes transformation algorithm-derived look-up scheme. The iterative CORDIC algorithm is rigorous for infinite bit resolution, permitting in principle arbitrary precision, while its intrinsic sequential nature entails a substantial pipeline latency, and a high resolution overhead to combat finite iteration quantization error accumulation. Look-Up Table (LUT) size, due to the two Cartesian input dimensionality, increases rapidly with resolution and is thus limited to a small-resolution input data regime. Signal latencies may become essential e.g. for C2P inside a feedback loop. With the present hybrid scheme, numbers of iterations may be reduced by up to 50%, at no penalty or even at a reduction of silicon area and power consumption. Finally, such a hybrid architecture permits technology independent HDL models, a prerequisite for full portability and reuse.","doi":"10.1109/FREQ.2002.1075961","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2002 IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium and PDA Exhibition (Cat.

This step also enables us to introduce two novel moves that significantly enhance the performance of the algorithm when the DOA tracks cross.

This observation leads naturally to a variety of detection and estimation problems in the linear statistical model. To solve these problems, one requires oblique pseudo-inverses, oblique projections, and zero-forcing orthogonal projections. The problem is that these operators depend on knowledge of signal and interference subspaces, and this information is often not at hand. More typically, the signal subspace is known, but the interference subspace is unknown. We prove a theorem that allows these operators to be estimated directly from experimental data, without knowledge of the interference subspace. As a byproduct, the theorem shows how signal subspace covariance may be estimated. When the strict identities of the theorem are approximated, then the detectors, estimators, and beamformers of this paper take on the form of adaptive subspace estimators, detectors, and Capon beamformers, all of which are reduced in rank. The fundamental operator turns out to be a certain reduced-rank Wiener filter, which we clarify in the course of our derivations.

I see ibid., vol.50, no.12, p.2947-61 (2000). In Part I, the problem of the linear time-variant (LTV) filtering is addressed in the fraction-of-time (FOT) probability framework. The adopted approach, which is an alternative to the classical stochastic one, provides a statistical characterization of the systems in terms of functions that can be estimated by a single time-series. The analysis is carried out with reference to the wide class of the generalized almost-cyclostationary (GACS) signals, which includes, as a special case, the class of the almost-cyclostationary (ACS) signals. Examples of applications and developments of the theory introduced in Part I are presented here in Part II. Specifically, the countability of the set of the output cycle frequencies is studied with reference to linear time-variant systems for both ACS and GACS not containing any ACS component input signals. Thus, the linear almost-periodically time-variant filtering and the product modulation are considered in detail. Moreover, several Doppler channel models are analyzed. In all these examples, it is shown that the FOT probability approach allows one to characterize the system and its output in terms of statistical functions that can be measured by a single time-series. Furthermore, the usefulness of considering the linear filtering problem within the class of the GACS signals is clarified, and several pitfalls arising from continuing to adopt for the observed time-series the ACS model when an increase in the data-record length makes the GACS model more appropriate are pointed out.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2002.805500","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/23193/01075990.pdf","startPage":"2962","endPage":"2975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2002.805500","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","displayDocTitle":"Linear time-variant transformations of generalized almost-cyclostationary signals.II.

In this paper, the reason for this performance failure is identified, and a remedy is proposed. A multiwavelet design criterion known as omnidirectional balancing is introduced to extend to vector transforms the balancing philosophy previously proposed for multiwavelet-based scalar-signal expansion. It is shown that the straightforward implementation of a vector wavelet transform, namely, the application of a scalar transform to each vector component independently, is a special case of an omnidirectionally balanced vector wavelet transform in which filter-coefficient matrices are constrained to be diagonal. Additionally, a family of symmetric-antisymmetric multiwavelets is designed according to the omnidirectional-balancing criterion. In empirical results for a vector-field compression system, it is observed that the performance of vector wavelet transforms derived from these omnidirectionally-balanced symmetric-antisymmetric multiwavelets is far superior to that of transforms implemented via other multiwavelets and can exceed that of diagonal transforms derived from popular scalar wavelets.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2002.805488","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/23193/01075995.pdf","startPage":"3018","endPage":"3027","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2002.805488","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet transforms for vector fields using omnidirectionally balanced multiwavelets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1075995","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1075995/","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet transforms for vector fields using omnidirectionally balanced multiwavelets","volume":"50","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2002","accessionNumber":"7472547","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1075995/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet transforms for vector fields using omnidirectionally balanced multiwavelets","sourcePdf":"01075995.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084299S","chronDate":"Dec 2002","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"23193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"23193","articleId":"1075995","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1075997,"authors":[{"name":"P.

It is shown that the optimal strategy is to place pilot symbols satisfying certain orthogonality condition in such a way that data and pilot symbols with higher power are in the middle of the packet. The results also indicate that the optimal pilot placements are independent of channel probability distribution. For constant modulus symbols, we show that the quasi-periodic placement and its generalization in the multiuser case turn out to be optimal.

The time-varying channel is assumed to be described by a complex exponential basis expansion model (CE-BEM). The linear prediction error method for blind identification of time-invariant channels is extended to time-varying channels represented by a CE-BEM. Sufficient conditions for identifiability are investigated. The cyclostationary nature of the received signal is exploited to consistently estimate the time-varying correlation function of the data from a single observation record. The proposed method requires the knowledge of the active basis functions but not the channel length (an upper bound suffices). Several existing methods require precise knowledge of the channel length. Equalization of the time-varying channel, given the estimated channel, is investigated.

The main difficulty that arises in the use of the adaptive receiver for multirate CDMA systems is that the adaptation should resume after the rate change. Hence, the adaptive receiver may not provide a reasonable performance during the transient after the rate change. In order to overcome this difficulty, we investigate an approach that allows updating the weight vectors for all rates simultaneously. For example, in a dual-rate system, the weight vector for the lower rate (the higher rate) can be updated during the period of the higher rate (resp., the lower rate) to avoid the transient after the rate change. The resulting adaptive receiver has multiple parallel adaptive filters. The adaptive filters for each rate can carry out the adaptation simultaneously, regardless of what the current rate is. As a result, the performance is not degraded by the rate change.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive MMSE receiver for multirate CDMA systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2002.805498","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/23193/01076002.pdf","startPage":"3098","endPage":"3106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2002.805498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23193","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1076002","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1076002/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 2002","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive MMSE receiver for multirate CDMA systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"50","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1076002/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 2002","accessionNumber":"7472554","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive MMSE receiver for multirate CDMA systems","sourcePdf":"01076002.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06897S","chronDate":"Dec 2002","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"23193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"23193","articleId":"1076002","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1076004,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Guo","affiliation":["Research Center of Electronic Engineering Technology, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Xin Guo","id":"37292758400"},{"name":"Hong-Bo Sun","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Hong-Bo Sun","id":"37277694100"},{"name":"Sheng-Li Wang","affiliation":["Nanjing Research Institute of Electronics Technology, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Sheng-Li Wang","id":"37985787000"},{"name":"Guo-Sui Liu","affiliation":["Research Center of Electronic Engineering Technology, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Guo-Sui Liu","id":"37881379200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"1076004","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":42,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":938},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chirp","Discrete transforms","Sampling methods","Sun","Robustness","Signal processing","Signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","signal resolution","signal processing","parameter estimation","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete chirp-Fourier transform","chirp rate estimation","DCFT","picket-fence effect","sample rate","analog-to-discrete parameter conversion","chirp signal","chirp rate detection resolution","chirp rate error","sidelobes magnitude","multicomponent signal","low SNR signal"]}],"abstract":"This comment points out that the sample rate of the discrete chirp-Fourier transform (DCFT) proposed by Xia (see ibid., vol.48, p. 3122-33, 2000) is not sufficient to avoid severe \"picket-fence\" effect and causes some restrictions for its practical applications. By increasing the sample rate and modifying the DCFT definition, a new robust DCFT is proposed. Xia (see ibid., vol.50, no.12, p.3116, 2002) replies by first correcting an error on the analog-to-discrete parameter conversions of a chirp signal. Xia also add that when the chirp rate detection resolution is increased, it is more robust to the chirp rate error. On the other- hand, what is sacrificed by doing so is that the magnitudes of the sidelobes of the transform are increased, which may limit its capability of detecting chirps in a multicomponent or low SNR signal. Therefore, which DCFT needs to be used has to depend on the practical application.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2002.805492","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/23193/01076004.pdf","startPage":"3115","endPage":"3116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2002.805492","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comments on discrete chirp-Fourier transform and its application to chirp rate estimation [with reply]","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1076004","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1076004/","displayDocTitle":"Comments on discrete chirp-Fourier transform and its application to chirp rate estimation [with reply]","volume":"50","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2002","accessionNumber":"7472556","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1076004/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comments on discrete chirp-Fourier transform and its application to chirp rate estimation [with reply]","sourcePdf":"01076004.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061723S","chronDate":"Dec.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"23193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"23193","articleId":"1076004","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1076005,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"1076005","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":371},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chirp","Discrete transforms","Sampling methods","Error correction","Signal processing","Frequency"]}],"abstract":"University of Delaware","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Response to \"comments on 'discrete Chirp-Fourier transform and its application to Chirp rate estimation'\"","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2002.805491","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/23193/01076005.pdf","startPage":"3116","endPage":"3116","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/01076005.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2002.805491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23193","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1076005","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1076005/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 2002","displayDocTitle":"Response to \"comments on 'discrete Chirp-Fourier transform and its application to Chirp rate estimation'\"","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"50","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1076005/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Response to \"comments on 'discrete Chirp-Fourier transform and its application to Chirp rate estimation'\"","sourcePdf":"01076005.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029583S","chronDate":"Dec 2002","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"23193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"23193","articleId":"1076005","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1076010,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Results of experimental tests performed on a Miller CMOS opamp connected in the voltage follower configuration are presented and compared with model predictions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2002.804766","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/23194/01076010.pdf","startPage":"495","endPage":"502","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2002.804766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new nonlinear model of EMI-induced distortion phenomena in feedback CMOS operational amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 2002","displayDocTitle":"A new nonlinear model of EMI-induced distortion phenomena in feedback CMOS operational amplifiers","volume":"44","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1076010/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2002","accessionNumber":"7471223","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1076010/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new nonlinear model of EMI-induced distortion phenomena in feedback CMOS operational amplifiers","sourcePdf":"01076010.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045933S","chronDate":"Nov 2002","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"23194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"23194","articleId":"1076010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1076013,"authors":[{"name":"Choy Yoong Tham","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Wales, Swansea, UK","Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"lastName":"Choy Yoong Tham","id":"37087636708"},{"name":"A.

However, there are certain advantages in obtaining the time-domain waveform from frequency-domain data. Taking samples to characterize the frequency spectrum of a resonant structure with no prior knowledge of its behavior, poses difficulty. There is no foolproof way to determine the sampling resolution that will yield an accurate result while keeping the number of samples to a minimum. We propose a frequency sampling technique using a dynamic adaptive algorithm. The algorithm zeroes in on the resonant peaks without user intervention and computes the samples to the required resolution. The resolution is relaxed where appropriate, to achieve economy of samples. A modified discrete Fourier transform formula is used to process the nonuniformly spaced frequency data into the time-domain waveform. Computation time is vastly reduced. This technique enables the frequency-domain approach to be used for modeling transients in very high-Q structures accurately.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1076013/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1076013/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 2002","accessionNumber":"7471226","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"44","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A dynamic adaptive sampling technique in frequency-domain transient analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dynamic adaptive sampling technique in frequency-domain transient analysis","sourcePdf":"01076013.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038619S","chronDate":"Nov 2002","isNumber":"23194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"11","articleId":"1076013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":1076017,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Although the active model-based method was initially viewed as an optimization problem, most researchers implement it as a partial differential equation solution. The advantages and disadvantages of the active model-based method are distinct: speed and stability. To improve its performance, a parallel genetic algorithm-based active model method is proposed and applied to segment the lateral ventricles from magnetic resonance brain images. First, an objective function is defined. Then one instance surface was extracted using the finite-difference method-based active model and used to initialize the first generation of a parallel genetic algorithm. Finally, the parallel genetic algorithm is employed to refine the result. We demonstrate that the method successfully overcomes numerical instability and is capable of generating an accurate and robust anatomic descriptor for complex objects in the human brain, such as the lateral ventricles.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1076035/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Aug. 2002","accessionNumber":"7470134","pubMedId":"12472263","htmlLink":"/document/1076035/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"8","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Volumetric segmentation of brain images using parallel genetic algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Volumetric segmentation of brain images using parallel genetic algorithms","sourcePdf":"01076035.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047568S","chronDate":"Aug.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"23195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"23195","articleId":"1076035","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1076037,"authors":[{"name":"B. van Ginneken","affiliation":["Image Sciences Institute, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands"],"firstName":"B.","lastName":"van Ginneken","id":"37271824900"},{"name":"A.F.

In this analysis, a complex Gaussian pulse is followed through one pass around the laser cavity. Approximations are made to the line shape and modulation characteristics to keep the pulse Gaussian. After one round trip, a self-consistent solution is required. This yields simple analytic expressions for the pulse length, frequency chirp, and bandwidth of the mode-locked pulses. The analysis is further extended to include effects of detuning of the modulator, in which case analytical expressions are obtained for the phase shift of the pulse within the modulation cycle, the shift of the pulse spectrum off line center, the change in pulse length, and the change in power output. Numerical results for a typical Nd:YAG laser are given. In the case of the FM mode-locked laser it is found that there is a frequency chirp on the pulse and that this causes pulse compression and stretching when the modulator is detuned. Etalon effects and dispersion effects are also considered.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FM and AM mode locking of the homogeneous laser - Part I: Theory","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1970.1076343","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23202/01076343.pdf","startPage":"694","endPage":"708","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1970.1076343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23202","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1076343","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1076343/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"November  1970","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  1970","displayDocTitle":"FM and AM mode locking of the homogeneous laser - Part I: Theory","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"November 1970","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FM and AM mode locking of the homogeneous laser - Part I: Theory","sourcePdf":"01076343.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039373S","chronDate":"November  1970","isNumber":"23202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"500","articleId":"1076343","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":1076352,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Successful locking is achieved by employing a novel hybrid injection-locking technique. In the hybrid mode, the higher power laser is tuned to operate on a self-oscillation line different from that of the reference laser. Within the frequency-locking range, the self-oscillation of the locked laser is completely quenched, and only the amplified drive power of the locking laser appears. Operation of this hybrid technique relies on the line competition in the homogeneously broadened CO\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>\nmedium. The hybrid technique, which is easily implemented with a simple hill-climbing servo, permits stabilized operation over a variety of laser lines. An analysis of injection locking that explicity includes the saturation of the homogeneous medium is presented. Expressions are obtained for the gain and the phase relationships within and outside the locking region. To demonstrate the potential of the hybrid injection-locking technique, a 60-W CO\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>\nlaser was locked in frequency to a 0.5-W stable oscillator.

The refractive index is approximated by a piecewise-linear distribution for which exact solutions of the guided-wave problem can be obtained. For multimode guides, useful approximate solutions can be worked out with the help of the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation. A formula is given for the total number of guided TE modes supported by the waveguide. The coupling efficiency of a prism coupler is investigated by studying the radiation losses of the guided modes escaping from the waveguide through the coupling prism. It is found that the radiation losses of the modes of the graded-index waveguide are more nearly constant than those of the asymmetric slab waveguide.","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1973.1077408","startPage":"1000","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/23237/01077408.pdf","endPage":"1006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1973.1077408","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1973","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1973","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1077408/","displayDocTitle":"TE modes of graded-index slab waveguides","volume":"9","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"October 1973","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TE modes of graded-index slab waveguides","sourcePdf":"01077408.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023282S","chronDate":"Oct 1973","isNumber":"23237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"99","articleId":"1077408","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1077437,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A simple optical technique is shown for dispersing an optical beam so that each frequency component passes through the appropriate part of a transversely adjusted gap (TAG) laser. A TAG laser can be constructed by subjecting a GaAs injection laser to a transverse thermal gradient.

An analysis of optical ray angle and spatial-dispersion alignment tolerances is presented. Two TAG-laser subsystems-a multiplex modulator and an amplifier-are proposed and discussed to indicate how the TAG laser's larger bandwidth and spatial dispersion may simplify optical communication systems.

In view of this situation, the design concept of antenna systems for small mobile terminals and its future perspective are discussed, referring to the trends in modern mobile communications and the demands for the antenna system. The design concept of antenna systems has changed along with the progress of mobile systems. In the conventional design, the conducting material of the equipment case, existing near the antenna element, is included as a part of the radiator in the antenna system, without regard to whether or not it has been considered. In the latest mobile phones, the design concept has been advanced to aim at improving the antenna's performance, and the treatment of the case, etc., has become a part of this. Some particular considerations for the design are to relieve the degradation of the antenna's performance due to the human-body effect, to overcome the SAR problems, and yet to make the size small. Furthermore, it is now time to proceed to the more-advanced concept, in which implementation of adaptive control and software is considered, even in small mobile terminals. Typical trends in modern communications systems are discussed, and the demands of these trends-which are summarized as down-sizing, function, and intelligence-are taken up for future antenna structures. Small-antenna technology and the application of the integration technology to antenna systems are essential for realizing such future structures.","doi":"10.1109/MAP.2002.1077775","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/74/23248/01077775.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAP.2002.1077775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23248","startPage":"30","endPage":"43","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design concept of antennas for small mobile terminals and the future perspective","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1077775","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design concept of antennas for small mobile terminals and the future perspective","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1077775/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"44","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7460203","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1077775/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design concept of antennas for small mobile terminals and the future perspective","sourcePdf":"01077775.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072839S","chronDate":"Oct.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"23248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"23248","articleId":"1077775","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1077777,"authors":[{"name":"G.S.

We discuss many reported upper bounds on the maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding error probability and demonstrate the underlying connections that exist between them. In addressing the Gallager bounds and their variations, we focus on the Duman and Salehi (see IEEE Trans. Commun., vol.46, p.717-723, 1998)variation, which originates from the standard Gallager bound. A large class of efficient bounds (or their Chernoff versions) is demonstrated to be a special case of the generalized second version of the Duman and Salehi bounds. Implications and applications of these observations are pointed out, including the fully interleaved fading channel, resorting to either matched or mismatched decoding. The proposed approach can be generalized to geometrically uniform nonbinary codes, finite-state channels, bit interleaved coded modulation systems, and it can be also used for the derivation of upper bounds on the conditional decoding error probability.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2002.805064","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/23251/01077797.pdf","startPage":"3029","endPage":"3051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23251","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2002.805064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variations on the Gallager bounds, connections, and applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1077797","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 2002","displayDocTitle":"Variations on the Gallager bounds, connections, and applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1077797/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"7471203","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1077797/","volume":"48","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variations on the Gallager bounds, connections, and applications","sourcePdf":"01077797.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146776S","chronDate":"Dec 2002","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"23251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"23251","articleId":"1077797","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1077798,"authors":[{"name":"I.

An important design goal is to maximize the level of space diversity that a code can achieve. Toward this goal, the only systematic algebraic coding theory so far is binary rank theory by Hammons and El Gamal (see ibid. vol. 46, p.524-42, 2000) for binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulated codes defined over binary field and quaternary phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulated codes defined over modulo four finite ring. To design codes with higher bandwidth efficiency, we develop an algebraic rank theory to ensure full space diversity for 2/sup 2k/ quadrature and amplitude modulated (QAM) codes for any positive integer k. The theory provides the most general sufficient condition of full space diversity so far. It includes the BPSK binary rank theory as a special case. Since the condition is over the same domain that a code is defined, the full space diversity code design is greatly simplified. The usefulness of the theory is illustrated in examples, such as analyses of existing codes, constructions of new space-time codes with better performance, including the full diversity space-time turbo codes.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2002.805074","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2002.805074","startPage":"3062","endPage":"3079","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/23251/01077799.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A rank criterion for QAM space-time codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1077799/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","displayDocTitle":"A rank criterion for QAM space-time codes","volume":"48","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","accessionNumber":"7471205","publicationDate":"Dec. 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1077799/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A rank criterion for QAM space-time codes","sourcePdf":"01077799.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109164S","chronDate":"Dec 2002","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"23251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"23251","articleId":"1077799","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1077800,"authors":[{"name":"Dongning Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Dongning Guo","id":"37272631900"},{"name":"S.

This family of receivers encompasses the single-user matched filter, the decorrelator, the minimum mean square error (MMSE) receiver, the parallel interference cancelers, and many other linear receivers of interest. Both with and without the assumption of perfect power control, we show that the output decision statistic for each user converges to a Gaussian random variable in distribution as the number of users and the spreading factor both tend to infinity with their ratio fixed. Analysis reveals that the distribution conditioned on almost all spreading sequences converges to the same distribution, which is also the unconditional distribution. This normality principle allows the system performance, e.g., the multiuser efficiency, to be completely determined by the output signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) for large linear systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic normality of linear multiuser receiver outputs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2002.805066","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/23251/01077800.pdf","startPage":"3080","endPage":"3095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2002.805066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23251","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1077800","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1077800/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 2002","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic normality of linear multiuser receiver outputs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1077800/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 2002","accessionNumber":"7471206","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic normality of linear multiuser receiver outputs","sourcePdf":"01077800.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155906S","chronDate":"Dec 2002","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"23251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"23251","articleId":"1077800","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1077802,"authors":[{"name":"M.P.C.

By verifying that antenna diversity one can substitute for time and/or frequency diversity at providing ergodicity, we show that these asymptotic solutions approximate the ergodic capacity very closely even when the number of antennas is very small.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2002.805084","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/23251/01077806.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2002.805084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23251","startPage":"3117","endPage":"3128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of multiple-transmit multiple-receive antenna architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1077806","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of multiple-transmit multiple-receive antenna architectures","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1077806/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"48","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2002","accessionNumber":"7471212","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1077806/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of multiple-transmit multiple-receive antenna architectures","sourcePdf":"01077806.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100568S","chronDate":"Dec 2002","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"23251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"136","xplore-issue":"23251","articleId":"1077806","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1077807,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The key features of the analysis are that the users are allowed to be completely asynchronous, and that the chip waveform is assumed to be the ideal Nyquist sinc function. It is shown that the asymptotic signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) at the detector output is the same as that in an equivalent chip-synchronous system. It is hence been established that synchronous analyses of linear MMSE detection can provide useful guidelines for the performance in asynchronous band-limited systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/23251/01077807.pdf","startPage":"3128","endPage":"3137","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2002.805078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2002.805078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23251","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1077807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MMSE detection in asynchronous CDMA systems: an equivalence result","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Detectors","Performance analysis","Delay","Guidelines","Least mean squares methods","Matched filters","Mean square error methods","Multiuser detection","Subcontracting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","signal detection","multiuser channels","bandlimited communication","spread spectrum communication","radiofrequency interference","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear MMSE detection","band-limited CDMA system","code-division multiple-access","random spreading sequences","asynchronous CDMA systems","linear minimum mean-square error detection","chip waveform","ideal Nyquist sine function","asymptotic SIR","signal-to-interference ratio","chip-synchronous system","synchronous analyses","asynchronous band-limited systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1077807/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","displayDocTitle":"MMSE detection in asynchronous CDMA systems: an equivalence result","volume":"48","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1077807/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2002","accessionNumber":"7471213","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MMSE detection in asynchronous CDMA systems: an equivalence result","sourcePdf":"01077807.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10612S","chronDate":"Dec 2002","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"23251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"23251","articleId":"1077807","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"}]
