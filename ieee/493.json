Based on the nature of the demands, it may be convenient to set up lightpaths with different bit rates. Then, the network design cost could be reduced because low-bit-rate services will need less grooming (i.e., less multiplexing with other low-bit-rate services onto high-capacity wavelengths) while high-bit-rate services can be accommodated on a wavelength itself. Future optical networks may support mixed line rates (say over 10/40/100 Gbps). Since a lightpath may travel a long distance, for high bit rates, the effect of the physical impairments along a lightpath may become very significant (leading to high bit-error rate (BER)); and the signal's maximum transmission range, which depends on the bit rate, will become limited. In this study, we propose a novel, cost-effective approach to design a mixed-line-rate (MLR) network with transmission-range (TR) constraint. By intelligent assignment of channel rates to lightpaths, based on their TR constraint, the need for signal regeneration can be minimized, and a ldquotransparentrdquo optical network can be designed to support all-optical end-to-end lightpaths. The design problem is formulated as an integer linear program (ILP). Our results show that, with mixed line rates and maximum transmission range constraints, one can design a cost-effective network.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Symposium on Advanced Networks and Telecommunication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4911415/4937757/04937771.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","publicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Symposium on Advanced Networks and Telecommunication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ANTS.2008.4937771","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANTS.2008.4937771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4937757","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4937771","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transparent optical network design with mixed line rates","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber networks","Optical design","Bit rate","Bit error rate","Telecommunication traffic","Costs","WDM networks","Intelligent networks","Repeaters","Signal design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","error statistics","integer programming","linear programming","optical fibre networks","telecommunication channels","telecommunication traffic","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transparent optical network design","mixed-line rate network","network traffic","bit-error rate","BER","intelligent channel rate assignment","signal regeneration","end-to-end lightpaths","integer linear program","ILP","WDM","MLR network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical Network","WDM","Network Design","Mixed Line Rate","Signal Regeneration","Maximum Transmission Range","Bit-Error Rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4937771/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Transparent optical network design with mixed line rates","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4937771/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10647534","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2009","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transparent optical network design with mixed line rates","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"Nag-transparent.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051216S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4911415","isNumber":"4937757","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4911415","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4937757","articleId":"4937771","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4937792,"authors":[{"name":"Jayashree Ratnam","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Jayashree","lastName":"Ratnam","id":"37636480500"},{"name":"Saswat Chakrabarti","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Saswat","lastName":"Chakrabarti","id":"37287172900"},{"name":"Debasish Datta","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Debasish","lastName":"Datta","id":"37269792400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3600-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3601-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-1676"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-1684"}],"articleNumber":"4937792","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Passive optical networks","Wavelength division multiplexing","Optical network units","Optical fiber networks","Arrayed waveguide gratings","Transceivers","WDM networks","Multiaccess communication","Optical fiber couplers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","optical fibre networks","resource allocation","search problems","telecommunication traffic","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic-aware code allocation","passive optical network","hybrid PON","wavelength-division multiplexing","WDM","optical code-division multiple access system","OCDMA technique","resource allocation scheme","search mechanism"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Resource provisioning","throughput","wavelength-division multiplexing with optical code-division multiple access (W-OCDMA)","passive optical network (PON)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we examine the resource provisioning aspects in a passive optical network (PON) employing wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) and optical code-division multiple access (OCDMA) techniques.

First, input variables needed for neural network are determined by time series. This model relates the current price to the values of past prices. Second, neural network is used for one day a head price forecasting. Designed ANN based on feed-forward back propagation was trained and tested using year 2005 data from the electricity market of Iran.

This paper introduces CCPSO, a new Cooperative Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm for combinatorial problems. The cooperative strategy is achieved by splitting the candidate solution vector into components, where each component is optimized by a particle. Particles move throughout a continuous space, their movements based on the influences exerted by static particles that then get feedback based on the fitness of the candidate solution. Here, the application of this technique to side-chain packing (a proteomics optimization problem) is investigated. To verify the efficiency of the proposed CCPSO algorithm, we test our algorithm on three side-chain packing problems and compare our results with the provably optimal result. Computational results show that the proposed algorithm is very competitive, obtaining a conformation with an energy value within 1% of the provably optimal solution in many proteins.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Proteins","Amino acids","Design optimization","Robustness","Partitioning algorithms","Feedback","Algorithm design and analysis","Optimization methods","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinatorial mathematics","particle swarm optimisation","proteins","proteomics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative combinatorial particle swarm optimization algorithm","side-chain packing","numerical optimization","proteomics optimization","proteins","amino acids"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4937840","doi":"10.1109/SIS.2009.4937840","startPage":"22","endPage":"29","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4911120/4937832/04937840.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4937832","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIS.2009.4937840","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4937840/","displayDocTitle":"A cooperative combinatorial Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm for side-chain packing","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10647195","htmlLink":"/document/4937840/","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cooperative combinatorial Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm for side-chain packing","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"SI-22037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103495S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4911120","isNumber":"4937832","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4911120","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4937832","articleId":"4937840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4937841,"authors":[{"name":"Jagdish Chand Bansal","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Jagdish Chand","lastName":"Bansal","id":"37604735600"},{"name":"Kusum Deep","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Kusum","lastName":"Deep","id":"37598145400"},{"name":"Kalyan Veeramachaneni","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Kalyan","lastName":"Veeramachaneni","id":"37328431800"},{"name":"Lisa Osadciw","affiliation":["Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, US"],"firstName":"Lisa","lastName":"Osadciw","id":"37295212300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2762-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4937841","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4937841","abstract":"Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been extensively used in recent years for the optimization of nonlinear optimization problems. Two of the most popular variants of PSO are PSO-W (PSO with inertia weight) and PSO-C (PSO with constriction factor). Typically particles in swarm use information from global best performing particle, gbest and their own personal best, pbest. Recently, studies have focused on incorporating influences of other particles other than gbest. In this paper, we develop a methodology to share information between two particles using a Laplacian operator designed from Laplace probability density function. The properties of this operator are analyzed. Two particles share their positional information in the search space and a new particle is formed. The particle, called as Laplacian particle, replaces the worst performing particle in the swarm. Using this new operator, this paper introduces two algorithms namely Laplace Crossover PSO with inertia weight (LXPSO-W) and Laplace Crossover PSO with constriction factor (LXPSO-C). The performance of the newly designed algorithms is evaluated with respect to PSO-W and PSO-C using 15 benchmark test problems. The empirical results show that the new approach improves performance measured in terms of efficiency, reliability and robustness.","doi":"10.1109/SIS.2009.4937841","startPage":"30","endPage":"36","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4911120/4937832/04937841.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIS.2009.4937841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4937832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information sharing strategy among particles in Particle Swarm Optimization using Laplacian operator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Laplace equations","Probability density function","Algorithm design and analysis","Benchmark testing","Particle measurements","Robustness","Velocity control","Power engineering and energy","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mathematical operators","particle swarm optimisation","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information sharing strategy","particle swarm optimization","Laplacian crossover operator","Laplace probability density function","search space","Laplacian particle","Laplace crossover PSO-inertia weight","Laplace crossover PSO-constriction factor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4937841/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Information sharing strategy among particles in Particle Swarm Optimization using Laplacian operator","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4937841/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2009","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10647196","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information sharing strategy among particles in Particle Swarm Optimization using Laplacian operator","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"SI-22041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089944S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4911120","isNumber":"4937832","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4911120","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4937832","articleId":"4937841","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4937844,"authors":[{"name":"Yann Lorion","affiliation":["Goethe-University Frankfurt am Main, Germany"],"firstName":"Yann","lastName":"Lorion","id":"37640052900"},{"name":"Tjorben Bogon","affiliation":["Goethe-University Frankfurt am Main, Germany"],"firstName":"Tjorben","lastName":"Bogon","id":"37640052700"},{"name":"Ingo J.

Although PSO is considered efficient compared to other contemporary population based optimization techniques, for many continuous multimodal and multidimensional problems, it still suffers from performance loss when it is targeted onto embedded application platforms. Examples of such target applications include small mobile robots and distributed sensor nodes in sensor network applications. In a previous work we presented a novel, modular, efficient and portable hardware architecture to accelerate the performance of the PSO for embedded applications. This paper extends the work by presenting a parallelization technique for further speedup of the PSO algorithm by dividing the swarm into a set of subswarms that are executing in parallel. The underlying communication topology and messaging protocols are described.

The results show that the probabilistic model predictions match simulation results and PFSA-based aggregation behaviors with fixed probabilities are unable to generate scalable aggregations in low robot densities. Moreover, we show that the use of a leave probability that is inversely proportional to the square of the neighbor count (as an estimate of aggregate size) does not improve the scalability of the behavior.","doi":"10.1109/SIS.2009.4937849","startPage":"88","endPage":"95","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4911120/4937832/04937849.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIS.2009.4937849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4937832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling self-organized aggregation in swarm robotic systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Robot sensing systems","Aggregates","Mobile robots","Analytical models","Feedback","Robotics and automation","Automata","Performance analysis","Infrared sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite state machines","mobile robots","multi-robot systems","probabilistic automata"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-organized aggregation modeling","swarm robotic system","mobile robot","probabilistic finite state automata","physics-based simulator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4937849/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Modeling self-organized aggregation in swarm robotic systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4937849/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2009","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10647204","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling self-organized aggregation in swarm robotic systems","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"SI-22033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049515S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4911120","isNumber":"4937832","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4911120","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4937832","articleId":"4937849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4937856,"authors":[{"name":"Tamanna Arora","affiliation":["University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Tamanna","lastName":"Arora","id":"37640437200"},{"name":"Melanie E.

In such complex designs, a primary design goal is to limit the power consumption of the chip. Power consumption depends on capacitance, which depends on the length of wires on the chip and the number of vias which connect wires on different layers of the chip. We use ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms to minimize wirelength, vias and capacitance. ACO provide a multi-agent framework for combinatorial optimization by combining memory, stochastic decision making and strategies of collective and distributed learning by ant-like agents. This paper applies ACO to the NP-hard problem of finding optimal routes with minimum capacitance for interconnect routing on VLSI chips. The constraints on interconnect routing are used by ants as heuristics which guide their search process. We implemented ACO algorithms on both manhattan and non-manhattan routing architectures. The results are compared with several state of the art academic routers. The ACO routing algorithm was able to obtain an overall improvement of 8% in terms of wire-length, 7% in terms of vias and capacitance. Running times were longer than those routers, but very similar to the other router which is able to route all wires on all benchmark chips.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4937856/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10647211","htmlLink":"/document/4937856/","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2009","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Ant Colony Optimization for power efficient routing in manhattan and non-manhattan VLSI architectures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ant Colony Optimization for power efficient routing in manhattan and non-manhattan VLSI architectures","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"SI-22043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074325S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4911120","isNumber":"4937832","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4911120","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4937832","articleId":"4937856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4937875,"authors":[{"name":"Farzad Khalvati","affiliation":["Department of Systems Design Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Farzad","lastName":"Khalvati","id":"37640460300"},{"name":"Hamid R.

In this paper, we develop hybrid techniques using different particle swarm optimization (PSO) heuristics to optimize the k-means algorithm and examine the reliability of parametric values for different variants of PSO and k-means algorithms. These PSO heuristics include linear inertia reduction, constriction factor, and dynamic inertia and maximum velocity reduction. The performance of these hybridization of PSO and the k-means algorithms was tested on the image segmentation. These PSO heuristics can make the K-means algorithm more stable for finding better solutions and less dependent on the initial cluster centers based on the preliminary experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/CIIP.2009.4937881","pdfPath":"/iel5/4911128/4937867/04937881.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"64","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Image Processing","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIIP.2009.4937881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4937867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybridization of particle swarm optimization with the K-Means algorithm for image classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4937881/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Hybridization of particle swarm optimization with the K-Means algorithm for image classification","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10647236","publicationDate":"March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4937881/","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybridization of particle swarm optimization with the K-Means algorithm for image classification","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"IP-0035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063399S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4911128","isNumber":"4937867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4911128","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4937867","articleId":"4937881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4937888,"authors":[{"name":"Nhat Vo","affiliation":["University of Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Nhat","lastName":"Vo","id":"37625852300"},{"name":"Duc Vo","affiliation":["University of Technology, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Duc","lastName":"Vo","id":"37636774900"},{"name":"Subhash Challa","affiliation":["University of Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Subhash","lastName":"Challa","id":"38283631500"},{"name":"Bill Moran","affiliation":["University of Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Bill","lastName":"Moran","id":"37410543500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2760-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4937888","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":650},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Face recognition","Scattering","Principal component analysis","Null space","Linear discriminant analysis","Video compression","Vectors","Image coding","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","face recognition","image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","face recognition","subspace analysis","Eigenfaces","Fisherfaces","Laplacianfaces"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a new approach to build a more robust and efficient face recognition system.

Various types of artificial neural networks are applied for behavior learning of mobile robots in unknown and dynamic environments. In the paper, we propose a method of distributed behavioral learning based on a spiking neural network. The robot learns the forward relationship from sensory inputs to motor outputs and inverse predictive relationship from motor outputs to sensory inputs.

Therefore, we use a parallel steady-state genetic algorithm for acquiring the network topology suitable to the environment.

These resources have been advantageously used, in the implementation, to reduce the computation delay compared to the solution that uses only FPGA CLBs (Logic Blocks).

It can be applied early during the design process and refined along all design steps. However, the main limitation is the huge number of faults that should be injected when large circuits and/or complex workloads and complex error models are considered. This usually leads to practical campaigns based on a randomly selected subset of all potential faults. However, results obtained in these conditions are only estimations and the error on the estimation is never quantified in the literature. This paper presents an approach to quantify both the error on the presented results and the confidence on the computed error interval. Conversely, the computation of the required number of faults to inject in order to achieve a given confidence and error interval is also discussed. Experimental results are shown, fully supporting the presented approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4938045/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 April 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4938045/","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10647387","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Precisely controlling the duration of fault injection campaigns: a Statistical view","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precisely controlling the duration of fault injection campaigns: a Statistical view","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"61A-149_154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045104S","chronDate":"6-9 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4911410","isNumber":"4937997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4911410","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4937997","articleId":"4938045","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4938060,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

Therefore, in conventional receiver architecture, an Anti-Aliasing Filter (AAF) is required to suppress these aliases. The used solution to relax the AAF consists on the over-sampling technique. A promising alternate solution is to non-uniformly sample the analog signal. Indeed, Non-Uniform Sampling (NUS) has been studied since decades and researchers proved that NUS avoids aliasing under some conditions. In this work, we focus on adapting NUS in a multistandard receiver to relax the AAF constraints. This leads to other advantages in the multistandard NUS-based homodyne receiver such as, reducing dynamic power consumption of the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). The most adapted and interesting scheme to be implemented is the time quantized pseudorandom sampling. The circuit added to generate non-uniform clock has to consume less power than the difference of power consumption between the non-uniform sampling and the uniform over-sampling. Hence, we propose a pseudorandom signal sampler to control the ADC. We realize a test platform and measure that it satisfies the power consumption condition.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4938067/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 April 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4938067/","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10647405","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Low power data conversion based on Non-Uniform Sampling for multistandard receiver","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low power data conversion based on Non-Uniform Sampling for multistandard receiver","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"82A-261_265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058432S","chronDate":"6-9 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4911410","isNumber":"4937997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4911410","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4937997","articleId":"4938067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4938069,"authors":[{"name":"Ghazi Ben Hmida","affiliation":["National Engineers school of Sfax, Electrical Engineering Department B.P.W, Laboratory of Electronics and Technology of Information (LETI), Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Ghazi","lastName":"Ben Hmida","id":"37640307200"},{"name":"Abdennaceur Kachouri","affiliation":["National Engineers school of Sfax, Electrical Engineering Department B.P.W, Laboratory of Electronics and Technology of Information (LETI), Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Abdennaceur","lastName":"Kachouri","id":"37390104600"},{"name":"Hamadi Ghariani","affiliation":["National Engineers school of Sfax, Electrical Engineering Department B.P.W, Laboratory of Electronics and Technology of Information (LETI), Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Hamadi","lastName":"Ghariani","id":"37640302900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4320-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4321-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4938069","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":356},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal design","Power amplifiers","Low-noise amplifiers","Differential amplifiers","Power supplies","Bioelectric phenomena","Frequency","Robustness","Operational amplifiers","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric potentials","biomedical electronics","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","differential amplifiers","integrated circuit design","low-power electronics","neurophysiology","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["micropower amplifier design","neural signal recording","differential input pair","common-mode rejection ratio","CMRR","3-metal 2-poly n-well standard CMOS process","amplifier current consumption","power supply rejection ratio","DC offset","size 0.35 mum","current 4.61 muA","power 9.22 muW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural signal recording","micro power amplifier","low noise","gain","CMRR","DC offset"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4938069","abstract":"This paper describes a micro power amplifier for neural signal recording.

The proposed methodology eliminates the need for repeated finite element meshing and subsequent electrostatic modeling of the device during mechanical deformation. With the reference domain defined to be the device geometry in the absence of electrostatic actuation, we eliminate the need for repeated finite element meshing. We achieve this by mapping the deformed electrostatic domain in which the electrostatic problem must be solved to the reference undeformed domain dasiaconformallypsila. A dasiaconformalpsila map preserves the form of the Laplace equation and the boundary conditions; thus, the finite element matrix for the electrostatic problem is solved only once in the reference undeformed electrostatic domain. The conformal map itself is generated through the solution of the same Laplace equation on the reference undeformed domain geometry and with displacement boundary conditions dictated by the movement of the mechanical domain. The proposed methodology is demonstrated through its application to the modeling of two MEMS devices with varying length-to-gap ratios, multiple dielectrics and complicated geometries. The accuracy of the proposed methodology is confirmed through comparisons of its results with results obtained using the conventional finite element solution from ANSYS.","doi":"10.1109/ESIME.2009.4938407","publicationTitle":"EuroSimE 2009 - 10th International Conference on Thermal, Mechanical and Multi-Physics Simulation and Experiments in Microelectronics and Microsystems","displayPublicationTitle":"EuroSimE 2009 - 10th International Conference on Thermal, Mechanical and Multi-Physics Simulation and Experiments in Microelectronics and Microsystems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4911414/4938404/04938407.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESIME.2009.4938407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4938404","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A conformal mapping based approach for fast two-dimensional FEM electrostatic analysis of MEMS devices without re-meshing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4938407","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A conformal mapping based approach for fast two-dimensional FEM electrostatic analysis of MEMS devices without re-meshing","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4938407/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10647415","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4938407/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A conformal mapping based approach for fast two-dimensional FEM electrostatic analysis of MEMS devices without re-meshing","confLoc":"Delft, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052642S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4911414","isNumber":"4938404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4911414","xplore-issue":"4938404","articleId":"4938407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4938455,"authors":[{"name":"B.

This is a topic relevant for a multi-scale framework to lifetime prediction in microelectronics packaging. To achieve that objective, epoxy-resins are synthesised by systematically varying their chemical structure and then characterised by various thermo-mechanical testing methods. It was found that moisture diffusion showed the most distinct response with respect to material and loading parameters such as polarity, free volume, crosslinking density, moisture concentration and temperature. Starting with a parametric study, modeling approaches of different complexity have been able to show qualitative and quantitative agreement respectively.

Unfortunately, the problem of how to maximize ensemble accuracy is, especially for classification, far from solved. In essence, the key problem is to find a suitable criterion, typically based on training or selection set performance, highly correlated with ensemble accuracy on novel data. Several studies have, however, shown that it is difficult to come up with a single measure, such as ensemble or base classifier selection set accuracy, or some measure based on diversity, that is a good general predictor for ensemble test accuracy. This paper presents a novel technique that for each learning task searches for the most effective combination of given atomic measures, by means of a genetic algorithm. Ensembles built from either neural networks or random forests were empirically evaluated on 30 UCI datasets. The experimental results show that when using the generated combined optimization criteria to rank candidate ensembles, a higher test set accuracy for the top ranked ensemble was achieved, compared to using ensemble accuracy on selection data alone. Furthermore, when creating ensembles from a pool of neural networks, the use of the generated combined criteria was shown to generally outperform the use of estimated ensemble accuracy as the single optimization criterion.","doi":"10.1109/CIDM.2009.4938656","pdfPath":"/iel5/4910529/4938616/04938656.pdf","startPage":"245","endPage":"251","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Data Mining","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Data Mining","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIDM.2009.4938656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4938616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ensemble member selection using multi-objective optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4938656/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Ensemble member selection using multi-objective optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10647072","publicationDate":"March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4938656/","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ensemble member selection using multi-objective optimization","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"DM-9082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10918S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4910529","isNumber":"4938616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4910529","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4938616","articleId":"4938656","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4938667,"authors":[{"name":"Shuo Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Binningham, Birmingham, UK"],"firstName":"Shuo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37634840400"},{"name":"Xin Yao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Binningham, Birmingham, UK"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Yao","id":"37276074900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2765-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4938667","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":205,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1965},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4938667","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data analysis","Voting","Bagging","Costs","Medical diagnosis","Text categorization","Intrusion detection","Semisupervised learning","Predictive models","Boosting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data handling","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity analysis","imbalanced data sets","ensemble models","medical diagnosis","fraud detection","text classification","weak learner","ensemble-based algorithms","class imbalance problem","resampling methods","under-sampling","over-sampling","SMOTE","data generation algorithm","two-class tasks","SMOTEBagging","multi-class data sets"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CIDM.2009.4938667","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Data Mining","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Data Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/4910529/4938616/04938667.pdf","startPage":"324","endPage":"331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIDM.2009.4938667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4938616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diversity analysis on imbalanced data sets by using ensemble models","abstract":"Many real-world applications have problems when learning from imbalanced data sets, such as medical diagnosis, fraud detection, and text classification. Very few minority class instances cannot provide sufficient information and result in performance degrading greatly. As a good way to improve the classification performance of weak learner, some ensemble-based algorithms have been proposed to solve class imbalance problem. However, it is still not clear that how diversity affects classification performance especially on minority classes, since diversity is one influential factor of ensemble. This paper explores the impact of diversity on each class and overall performance. As the other influential factor, accuracy is also discussed because of the trade-off between diversity and accuracy. Firstly, three popular re-sampling methods are combined into our ensemble model and evaluated for diversity analysis, which includes under-sampling, over-sampling, and SMOTE - a data generation algorithm. Secondly, we experiment not only on two-class tasks, but also those with multiple classes. Thirdly, we improve SMOTE in a novel way for solving multi-class data sets in ensemble model - SMOTEBagging.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4938667/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10647083","publicationDate":"March 2009","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4938667/","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Diversity analysis on imbalanced data sets by using ensemble models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diversity analysis on imbalanced data sets by using ensemble models","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"DM-9014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048334S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4910529","isNumber":"4938616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4910529","citationCount":"205","xplore-issue":"4938616","articleId":"4938667","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-09"},{"_id":4938676,"authors":[{"name":"Wanyu Deng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Wanyu","lastName":"Deng","id":"37632882000"},{"name":"Qinghua Zheng","affiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Qinghua","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37268131800"},{"name":"Lin Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Posts and Telecommunications,Xian, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37634758300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2765-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4938676","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":201,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3315},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine learning","Risk management","Least squares methods","Neural networks","Joining processes","Computer science","Mathematical model","Multi-layer neural network","Feedforward neural networks","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["regularized extreme learning machine","risk minimization","over-fitting model","structural risk minimization","weighted least square"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Least Square"]}],"abstract":"Extreme learning machine proposed by Huang G-B has attracted many attentions for its extremely fast training speed and good generalization performance.

As the energy storage capacity of the ultra-capacitor is limited, the energy management in such a powertrain can be particularly challenging, and charging/discharging of the ultra-capacitor has to be performed optimally to reduce fuel consumption and avoid drivability degradation. In this paper, a neural network model of the powertrain is first trained from the input/output data generated by a powertrain model; with this neural network model a neural network controller, which prescribes the power split between the engine and the electric motor, is trained using a multi-stream Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)-based training method. The weights of the neural network controller are then further refined on the original plant model by a stochastic perturbation approach. The choices of the neural network architecture and of the cost function to model the plant and the controller are rationalized.

Speech recognition experiments have been used to verify the effectiveness of the FPGA implementation for in-car speech recognition in comparison with an equivalent floating-point implementation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Automotive engineering","Speech recognition","Speech enhancement","Working environment noise","Automatic speech recognition","Costs","Microphones","Hardware","Automotive electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automotive engineering","digital signal processing chips","field programmable gate arrays","speech enhancement","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","spectral subtraction","automotive speech recognition","speech enhancement algorithms","electronic hardware","Spartan-3A DSP","field-programmable gate array device","general logic resources","equivalent floating-point implementation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4938726","doi":"10.1109/CIVVS.2009.4938726","startPage":"72","endPage":"79","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Workshop on Computational Intelligence in Vehicles and Vehicular Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Workshop on Computational Intelligence in Vehicles and Vehicular Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4911408/4938711/04938726.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4938711","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIVVS.2009.4938726","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4938726/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of spectral subtraction for automotive speech recognition","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10647355","htmlLink":"/document/4938726/","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of spectral subtraction for automotive speech recognition","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"VV-15008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067085S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4911408","isNumber":"4938711","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4911408","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4938711","articleId":"4938726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4938826,"authors":[{"name":"Yaochu Jin","affiliation":["Honda Research Institute Europe GmbH, Offenbach, Germany"],"firstName":"Yaochu","lastName":"Jin","id":"37276322600"},{"name":"Robin Gruna","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Technische Informatik (ITEC), Universit\u00e4t Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Robin","lastName":"Gruna","id":"37642941300"},{"name":"Ingo Paenke","affiliation":["Technology Division, Deutsche Bahn Netz, Frankfurt, Germany","Institut AIFB, Universit\u00e4t Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Ingo","lastName":"Paenke","id":"37642941400"},{"name":"Bernhard Sendhoff","affiliation":["Honda Research Institute Europe GmbH, Offenbach, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernhard","lastName":"Sendhoff","id":"37276617200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2764-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4938826","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Technological innovation","Evolution (biology)","Evolutionary computation","Organisms","Feedback","Genetic mutations","Biology computing","Pareto analysis","Systems biology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","Boolean algebra","evolutionary computation","genetic engineering","Pareto analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary multiobjective optimization","redundant genetic representations","quantitative analysis","local variability","genotype-phenotype mapping","Pareto-optimal solutions"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4938826","abstract":"Robustness and innovation are two essential facets for biological evolution, where robustness means the relative insensitivity of an organism's phenotype to mutations, while innovation (evolvability) denotes the individual's ability to evolve novel phenotypes that help its survival and reproduction. Although much research has been conducted on robustness and evolvability of both biological and computational evolutionary systems, little work on the quantitative analysis of the relationship between robustness and evolvability has been reported. In this work, a measure for innovation called local variability has been suggested. Based on a neutrality degree borrowed from literature [1] and local variability, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm has been employed to maximize the robustness and innovation by optimizing the genotype-phenotype mapping of the redundant representation. The obtained Pareto-optimal solutions are then analyzed to reveal the trade-off relationship between robustness and innovation of the redundant representation.","doi":"10.1109/MCDM.2009.4938826","pdfPath":"/iel5/4911363/4938813/04938826.pdf","startPage":"38","endPage":"45","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Multi-Criteria Decision-Making(MCDM)","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Multi-Criteria Decision-Making(MCDM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCDM.2009.4938826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4938813","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolutionary multi-objective optimization of robustness and innovation in redundant genetic representations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4938826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Evolutionary multi-objective optimization of robustness and innovation in redundant genetic representations","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10647312","publicationDate":"March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4938826/","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolutionary multi-objective optimization of robustness and innovation in redundant genetic representations","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"MC-0001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054147S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4911363","isNumber":"4938813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4911363","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4938813","articleId":"4938826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4938827,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Mazurek","affiliation":["Canadian Forces Aerospace Warface Centre, Canada"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Mazurek","id":"37642963600"},{"name":"Slawomir Wesolkowski","affiliation":["DRDC CORA, CFAWC in Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Slawomir","lastName":"Wesolkowski","id":"37265508600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2764-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4938827","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4938827","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Cost function","Vehicle safety","Genetic algorithms","Frequency estimation","Testing","Computational modeling","Sorting","Vehicles","Probability distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","Monte Carlo methods","stochastic processes","vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fleet mix computation","evolutionary multiobjective optimization","nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II","stochastic fleet estimation model","Monte Carlo-based model","vehicle fleet"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MCDM.2009.4938827","pdfPath":"/iel5/4911363/4938813/04938827.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Multi-Criteria Decision-Making(MCDM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Multi-Criteria Decision-Making(MCDM)","startPage":"46","endPage":"50","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4938813","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCDM.2009.4938827","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fleet mix computation using evolutionary multiobjective optimization","abstract":"We apply the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) to perform a multiobjective optimization of the stochastic fleet estimation (SaFE) model.

The proposed approach, called Speed-constrained Multi-objective PSO (SMPSO) allows to produce new effective particle positions in those cases in which the velocity becomes too high. Other features of SMPSO include the use of polynomial mutation as a turbulence factor and an external archive to store the non-dominated solutions found during the search. Our proposed approach is compared with respect to five multi-objective metaheuristics representative of the state-of-the-art in the area. For the comparison, two different criteria are adopted: the quality of the resulting approximation sets and the convergence speed to the Pareto front. The experiments carried out indicate that SMPSO obtains remarkable results in terms of both, accuracy and speed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Multi-Criteria Decision-Making(MCDM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4911363/4938813/04938830.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"73","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Multi-Criteria Decision-Making(MCDM)","doi":"10.1109/MCDM.2009.4938830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCDM.2009.4938830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4938813","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4938830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SMPSO: A new PSO-based metaheuristic for multi-objective optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Contracts","Genetic algorithms","Polynomials","Genetic mutations","Birds","Marine animals","Educational institutions","Proposals","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","Pareto optimisation","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PSO-based metaheuristic","multi-objective optimization","multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm","speed-constrained multi-objective PSO","polynomial mutation","Pareto front","convergence speed"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4938830/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"SMPSO: A new PSO-based metaheuristic for multi-objective optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4938830/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10647316","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2009","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SMPSO: A new PSO-based metaheuristic for multi-objective optimization","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"MC-0011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.137205S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4911363","isNumber":"4938813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4911363","citationCount":"277","xplore-issue":"4938813","articleId":"4938830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4938841,"authors":[{"name":"Yusuke Nojima","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Intelligent Systems, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Sakai, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Nojima","id":"37282893100"},{"name":"Hisao Ishibuchi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Intelligent Systems, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Sakai, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hisao","lastName":"Ishibuchi","id":"37276592200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2764-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4938841","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interactive genetic fuzzy rule selection through evolutionary multiobjective optimization with user preference","abstract":"The design of fuzzy rule-based classifiers from numerical data can be regarded as one of data mining approaches. The main characteristic is its knowledge representation. Antecedent fuzzy sets of each fuzzy if-then rule linguistically represent a fuzzy region in the pattern space. When a user's main concern is knowledge extraction rather than classifier design, we have to consider two conflicting objectives: accuracy maximization and interpretability maximization. The number of correctly classified training patterns is often used for accuracy measure. On the other hand, interpretability is very subjective and hardly defined without the user's involvement. In this paper, we incorporate user's preference information into multiobjective genetic fuzzy rule selection. We propose a preference function composed of satisfaction level functions on six criteria: average confidence, average coverage, the number of used attributes, the maximum number of used granularities, classification accuracy, and the number of rules. Since it is hard to directly define each satisfaction level function beforehand, it is interactively modified by the user during the evolution. The preference function is handled as one of objective functions in multiobjective genetic fuzzy rule selection. The effectiveness of the proposed method is examined through a case study for knowledge extraction from the Pima Indian Diabetes data.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetics","Fuzzy systems","Data mining","Knowledge based systems","IEC","Fuzzy sets","Evolutionary computation","Algorithm design and analysis","Knowledge representation","Mean square error methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","evolutionary computation","fuzzy logic","fuzzy set theory","knowledge acquisition","knowledge representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interactive genetic fuzzy rule selection","evolutionary multiobjective optimization","user preference","fuzzy rule-based classifiers","data mining","knowledge representation","antecedent fuzzy sets","fuzzy if-then rule linguistic","knowledge extraction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4938841","doi":"10.1109/MCDM.2009.4938841","startPage":"141","endPage":"148","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Multi-Criteria Decision-Making(MCDM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Multi-Criteria Decision-Making(MCDM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4911363/4938813/04938841.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4938813","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCDM.2009.4938841","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4938841/","displayDocTitle":"Interactive genetic fuzzy rule selection through evolutionary multiobjective optimization with user preference","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10647327","htmlLink":"/document/4938841/","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interactive genetic fuzzy rule selection through evolutionary multiobjective optimization with user preference","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"MC-0036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.180661S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4911363","isNumber":"4938813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4911363","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4938813","articleId":"4938841","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4939000,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This article focuses on identifiers that have direct impact on quality of service (QoS)and effect of such identifiers is evaluated through computer simulation using OPNET Modeler 14.5 Wireless Suite. In this paper we have used advanced WiMAX features such as adaptive modulation and coding (AMC), automatic repeat request (ARQ) and hybrid-ARQ to tune the WiMAX network MAC layer such that its adaptation improves both capacity and delay (thus optimize the performance). ARQ is treated as higher layer to HARQ. HARQ gives up after maximum retransmissions. HARQ performs fast retransmissions and ARQ takes over in cases HARQ fails after multiple retransmissions. This gives an added layer of protection to data. HARQ is proved to be most suitable (when used with aggressive modulation and coding) for WiMAX due to its hybrid nature as it takes into account both the MAC and link layer. Using ARQ in conjunction with HARQ gives slight improvement in BLER (Block Error Rate) but at the expense of high UL frame utilization.","doi":"10.1109/CNSR.2009.12","publicationTitle":"2009 Seventh Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Seventh Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939083/4939084/04939100.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNSR.2009.12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939084","startPage":"6","endPage":"13","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WiMAX Network Optimization - Analyzing Effects of Adaptive Modulation and Coding Schemes Used in Conjunction with ARQ and HARQ","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4939100","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"WiMAX Network Optimization - Analyzing Effects of Adaptive Modulation and Coding Schemes Used in Conjunction with ARQ and HARQ","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939100/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10661540","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4939100/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WiMAX Network Optimization - Analyzing Effects of Adaptive Modulation and Coding Schemes Used in Conjunction with ARQ and HARQ","confLoc":"Moncton, NB, Canada","sourcePdf":"3649a006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077008S","chronDate":"11-13 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939083","isNumber":"4939084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939083","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4939084","articleId":"4939100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4939101,"authors":[{"name":"A.

CFO destroys the orthogonality of the subcarriers and introduces intercarrier interference (ICI), reducing the system performance. Previously, tone reservation (TR) was considered for reducing the peak interference-to-carrier ratio (PICR) and shown to provide significant PICR reduction. In this paper, we use submatrices of the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) and fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce the number of variables in the optimization to efficiently compute the optimal tones. Performance results are presented which demonstrate that the proposed algorithm yields PICR performance similar to that with the previous TR technique.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Seventh Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939083/4939084/04939101.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"19","publicationTitle":"2009 Seventh Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference","doi":"10.1109/CNSR.2009.13","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNSR.2009.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939084","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4939101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Carrier Frequency Offset Mitigation in OFDM Systems Using Efficient Tone Reservation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Transmitters","Interference","Fast Fourier transforms","Communication networks","Local oscillators","Bit error rate","Peak to average power ratio","Frequency estimation","AWGN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","intercarrier interference","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier frequency offset mitigation","OFDM systems","tone reservation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","transmitter","receiver oscillators","intercarrier interference","peak interference-to-carrier ratio","inverse fast Fourier transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939101/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Carrier Frequency Offset Mitigation in OFDM Systems Using Efficient Tone Reservation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4939101/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10661541","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","conferenceDate":"11-13 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Carrier Frequency Offset Mitigation in OFDM Systems Using Efficient Tone Reservation","confLoc":"Moncton, NB, Canada","sourcePdf":"3649a014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057099S","chronDate":"11-13 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939083","isNumber":"4939084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939083","xplore-issue":"4939084","articleId":"4939101","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4939131,"authors":[{"name":"Qiu Lin","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Qiu","lastName":"Lin"},{"name":"Zhang Yong","affiliation":["PCN and CAD Center Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Yong","id":"37430605500"},{"name":"Dai Chao","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Dai","lastName":"Chao"},{"name":"Song Mei","affiliation":["PCN and CAD Center Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Mei","id":"37276289800"},{"name":"Wang Danzhi","affiliation":["PCN and CAD Center Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Danzhi","id":"37644391700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4155-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3649-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4939131","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":192},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4939131","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cross layer design","Relays","Energy consumption","Communication networks","Energy states","Power system relaying","Power system modeling","Batteries","Rayleigh channels","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimisation","mobile radio","telecommunication channels","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-layer design","relay selection","power allocation strategy","mobile relay network","cooperative network lifetime","power consumption minimisation","channel quality","node residual energy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative diversity","cross-layer","relay selection","power allocation","network lifetime"]}],"abstract":"Summary form only given. In mobile relay networks, relay nodes in mobility generally have variable channel conditions and limited residual energy, which may affect the network performance.

In this cross-layer design, the best relay node is selected based on the channel quality and nodespsila residual energy, and the power allocation strategy is to reduce overall power consumption of nodes so that network lifetime can be prolonged. Simulation results show that the proposed cross-layer algorithm can provide significant network performance improvement in terms of network lifetime and power consumption due to cooperative diversity and its consideration of nodes residual energy.","doi":"10.1109/CNSR.2009.43","publicationTitle":"2009 Seventh Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Seventh Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939083/4939084/04939131.pdf","startPage":"232","endPage":"237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNSR.2009.43","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939084","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer Design for Relay Selection and Power Allocation Strategies in Cooperative Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939131/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Design for Relay Selection and Power Allocation Strategies in Cooperative Networks","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4939131/","accessionNumber":"10661570","publicationDate":"May 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Design for Relay Selection and Power Allocation Strategies in Cooperative Networks","confLoc":"Moncton, NB, Canada","sourcePdf":"3649a232.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036611S","chronDate":"11-13 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939083","isNumber":"4939084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939083","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4939084","articleId":"4939131","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4939133,"authors":[{"name":"Alex Morash","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Morash","id":"37644416900"},{"name":"Colin O'Flynn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"],"firstName":"Colin","lastName":"O'Flynn","id":"37858993500"},{"name":"Jacek Ilow","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"],"firstName":"Jacek","lastName":"Ilow","id":"37280038500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4155-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3649-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4939133","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Filters","Power amplifiers","Amplitude modulation","Radio broadcasting","Radio transmitters","Feeds","Differential amplifiers","Prediction algorithms","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude modulation","compensation","differential equations","field programmable gate arrays","harmonic distortion","harmonics suppression","power amplifiers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","EER amplifiers","spectral distortion","envelope elimination and restoration power amplifier","terrestrial amplitude modulation","radio broadcast transmitters","feed forward configuration","dynamic differential equations","reconstruction filter","total harmonic distortion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compensation of Non-linear Distortions","EER Amplifiers","FPGA Implementation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4939133","abstract":"This paper examines a practical method to reduce the spectral distortion at the output of an envelope elimination and restoration (EER) power amplifier (PA). The EER amplifiers utilized in terrestrial amplitude modulation (AM) radio broadcast transmitters are affected by non-linear and memory effects; the proposed compensation method exploits the source of these effects in real-world amplifiers. Specifically, using a new feed forward configuration for pre-processing the amplifier input, the algorithm predicts the PA output in real-time using its realistic behavior modeled through dynamic differential equations. The compensation method implemented at the base band considers the effects created by the most critical components of the EER amplifier, i.e, band-limiting of the envelope by the reconstruction filter and a non-linear load applied at the output of the reconstruction filter. The performance improvements of the proposed method are measured by its ability to reduce total harmonic distortion (THD) at the output of the system. Taking advantage of the efficient utilization of available computational resources, the feasibility of implementing this system is verified using a FPGA platform.","doi":"10.1109/CNSR.2009.45","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNSR.2009.45","startPage":"245","endPage":"251","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Seventh Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939083/4939084/04939133.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Seventh Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939084","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Implementation of a Novel Compensation Technique for EER Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Implementation of a Novel Compensation Technique for EER Amplifiers","conferenceDate":"11-13 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4939133/","accessionNumber":"10661572","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939133/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Implementation of a Novel Compensation Technique for EER Amplifiers","confLoc":"Moncton, NB, Canada","sourcePdf":"3649a245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061477S","chronDate":"11-13 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939083","isNumber":"4939084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939083","xplore-issue":"4939084","articleId":"4939133","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4939135,"authors":[{"name":"Han Wang","affiliation":["Dept. of Electron.

Based on the new algorithm, we also provide a digital down converter architecture using dual CORDIC processor to eliminate both multiplier and CORDIC scale factor.","doi":"10.1109/CNSR.2009.47","publicationTitle":"2009 Seventh Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Seventh Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939083/4939084/04939135.pdf","startPage":"257","endPage":"261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNSR.2009.47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939084","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Parallel Double-Step CORDIC Algorithm for Digital Down Converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939135/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Parallel Double-Step CORDIC Algorithm for Digital Down Converter","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4939135/","accessionNumber":"10661574","publicationDate":"May 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Parallel Double-Step CORDIC Algorithm for Digital Down Converter","confLoc":"Moncton, NB, Canada","sourcePdf":"3649a257.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038838S","chronDate":"11-13 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939083","isNumber":"4939084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939083","xplore-issue":"4939084","articleId":"4939135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4939140,"authors":[{"name":"Jianfeng Song","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Communications Laboratory, Information Science Institute, State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jianfeng","lastName":"Song","id":"37632212900"},{"name":"Jiandong Li","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Communications Laboratory, Information Science Institute, State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jiandong","lastName":"Li","id":"37279843400"},{"name":"Changle Li","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Communications Laboratory, Information Science Institute, State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Changle","lastName":"Li","id":"37278179200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4155-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3649-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4939140","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":261},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4939140","abstract":"An efficient scheduling algorithm can enhance the quality of service (QoS) provided by IEEE802.16e mobile WiMAX.

The implementation is done by allocating all sub-carriers to the users who transmit high data rate and alternate odd and even subcarriers are assigned to the other set of users who wish to transmit low data rate. The usage of alternate sub-carriers suggests to split CI codes in odd and even parts leading to an increase in capacity. Reduction in PAPR values is achieved through the phase shift of even CI code using odd sub-carriers by an amount of pi/2 and odd CI code using even sub-carriers by -pi/2, all measured with respect to the orthogonal codes supporting high data rate transmission. Finally, CI code optimization is done for further reduction in PAPR values. The proposed method also improves BER performance compared to the conventiona lCI/MC-CDMA system. Simulation results duly support this claim.","doi":"10.1109/CNSR.2009.53","publicationTitle":"2009 Seventh Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Seventh Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939083/4939084/04939141.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNSR.2009.53","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939084","startPage":"297","endPage":"304","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High Capacity CI/MC-CDMA System for Reduction in PAPR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4939141","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A High Capacity CI/MC-CDMA System for Reduction in PAPR","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939141/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10661580","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4939141/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High Capacity CI/MC-CDMA System for Reduction in PAPR","confLoc":"Moncton, NB, Canada","sourcePdf":"3649a297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085526S","chronDate":"11-13 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939083","isNumber":"4939084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939083","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4939084","articleId":"4939141","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4939143,"authors":[{"name":"Chong Tian","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Chong","lastName":"Tian","id":"37630294000"},{"name":"Dongfeng Yuan","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Dongfeng","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37276438900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4155-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3649-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4939143","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4939143","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Quality of service","Scheduling algorithm","Bandwidth","Temperature","Communication networks","Cross layer design","Frequency","Radiofrequency interference","Information science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","diversity reception","quality of service","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser diversity based scheduler","QoS support","cognitive radio networks","wireless spectrum","interference management","cross layer scheduling strategy","multiple cognitive users","general priority function","bandwidth utilization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CRN","Cross-layer","Scheduling Algorithm","QoS","Fairness","Interference"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CNSR.2009.55","publicationTitle":"2009 Seventh Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Seventh Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939083/4939084/04939143.pdf","startPage":"310","endPage":"316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNSR.2009.55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939084","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Multiuser Diversity Based Scheduler with QoS Support for Cognitive Radio Networks","abstract":"Cognitive radio networks (CRN) have been proposed to solve such problem of low utilization in wireless spectrum.

We use the game theory approach to investigate these issues. We model the problem of the channel allocation as an ordinal potential game and prove the existence of the desirable allocation profile.

The starting point for the derivation of the model is a new T-intersection geometric street scattering model, where both single-, double-bounced scattering mechanisms are assumed. Our geometry-based channel model takes into account the exact relationship between angle of arrival (AoA) and angle of departure (AoD). Based on this relationship, the reference model, the stochastic and the deterministic simulation model are derived, and the properties of temporal auto-correlation and space-time-frequency cross-correlation are studied. Finally, simulation result shows excellent correspondence between PSD of channel simulator and measured data.

The realm of biomechanics includes the circulatory and respiratory systems, tissue mechanics and mechanotransduction, and the musculoskeletal system and motor control. As in many other biological phenomena, many spatial scales are crossed by biomechanics research: intracellular, multicellular, and extracellular matrices; and tissue, organ, and multiorgan systems. It is well established that the effect of forces at higher scales influence behavior at lower scales and that lower-scale properties influence higher-scale response. However, computational methods that incorporate these interactions in biomechanics are relatively rare. In general, computational models that include representation of multiple spatial or temporal scales are loosely defined as multiscale. The fact that multiscale modeling is not well defined lends the term to a variety of scenarios within the computational physiology community. In biomechanics, multiscale modeling may mean establishing a hierarchical link between the spatial and temporal scales, while the output of a larger-scale system is passed through a finely detailed representation at a lower scale (e.g., body-level movement simulations that provide net joint loading for tissue-level stress analysis). In reality, multiscale modeling may require more intricate representation of interactions among scales. A concurrent simulation strategy is inevitable to adequately represent nonlinear associations that have been known for decades [1].","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939188/","volume":"28","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4939188/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10705738","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"19457733","publicationDate":"May-June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multiscale modeling in computational biomechanics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiscale modeling in computational biomechanics","sourcePdf":"12-28memb03-tawhai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.178486S","chronDate":"May-June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"51","isNumber":"4939176","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"51","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4939176","articleId":"4939188","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4939210,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A popular example of such a scheme is shaped offset quadrature phase-shift keying (SOQPSK).

The merits of the modified TED are demonstrated by comparing its performance with and without taking the data correlation into account. As a further modification, we show that a quantization scheme can be used to yield an extremely low-complexity version of the system with only negligible performance losses. The S-curve of the proposed quantized TED is given, which rules out the existence of false lock points. The proposed scheme shows great promise in a wide range of applications due to its low complexity, its lack of false lock points, and its blind nature; such applications include timing recovery for noncoherent detection schemes and false lock detectors.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.05.070091","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4939204/04939218.pdf","startPage":"1265","endPage":"1270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.05.070091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symbol Timing Recovery for CPM with Correlated Data Symbols","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4939218","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939218/","displayDocTitle":"Symbol Timing Recovery for CPM with Correlated Data Symbols","volume":"57","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10664539","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4939218/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbol Timing Recovery for CPM with Correlated Data Symbols","sourcePdf":"1265-tc0905-chandran.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096442S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4939204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4939204","articleId":"4939218","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4939219,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel B.

In this work, a class of code constellations is proposed, called generalized partly orthogonal designs (PODs) and both high-rate and low-rate feedback information is incorporated with possible feedback errors. A binary symmetric channel (BSC) model characterizes feedback errors. Two cases are studied: first, when the BSC bit error probability is known a priori to the transmission ends, and second, when it is not known exactly. Based on a minimum pairwise error probability (PEP) design criterion, we design a channel optimized vector quantizer (COVQ) for feedback information and a precoder matrix codebook to adjust the transmission codewords. The attractive property of our combining scheme is that it converges to conventional space-time coding with low-rate and erroneous feedback and to directional beamforming with high-rate and error-free feedback. This scheme also shows desirable robustness against feedback channel modeling mismatch.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.05.070272","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4939204/04939221.pdf","startPage":"1280","endPage":"1286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.05.070272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining Beamforming and Space-Time Coding Using Noisy Quantized Feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4939221","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939221/","displayDocTitle":"Combining Beamforming and Space-Time Coding Using Noisy Quantized Feedback","volume":"57","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10664542","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4939221/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining Beamforming and Space-Time Coding Using Noisy Quantized Feedback","sourcePdf":"1280-tc0905-ekbatani.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130743S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4939204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4939204","articleId":"4939221","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4939223,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Codes constructed based on these methods perform very well over the AWGN channel. With iterative decoding using a fast Fourier transform based sum-product algorithm, they achieve significantly large coding gains over Reed-Solomon codes of the same lengths and rates decoded with either algebraic hard-decision Berlekamp-Massey algorithm or algebraic soft-decision Kotter-Vardy algorithm. Due to their quasi-cyclic structure, these non-binary LDPC codes on Euclidean geometries can be encoded using simple shift-registers with linear complexity. Structured non-binary LDPC codes have a great potential to replace Reed-Solomon codes for some applications in either communication or storage systems for combating mixed types of noise and interferences.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939224/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","volume":"57","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10664545","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4939224/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"High Performance Non-Binary Quasi-Cyclic LDPC Codes on Euclidean Geometries LDPC Codes on Euclidean Geometries","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Performance Non-Binary Quasi-Cyclic LDPC Codes on Euclidean Geometries LDPC Codes on Euclidean Geometries","sourcePdf":"1298-tc0908-zhou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129383S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4939204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4939204","articleId":"4939224","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4939225,"authors":[{"name":"Yige Wang","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4939204/4939225/4939225-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yige Wang received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China in 2000 and 2003, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from University of Hawaii at Manoa in 2008, all in electrical engineering.

The design method consists of starting from the parity-check matrix of an LDPC code and developing an optimized parity-check matrix, with the same performance over the memoryless erasure channel, and suitable also for the iterative correction of single erasure bursts. The parity-check matrix optimization is performed by an algorithm called pivot searching and swapping (PSS) algorithm. It executes permutations of carefully chosen columns of the parity-check matrix, after a local analysis of particular variable nodes called stopping set pivots. This algorithm can be in principle applied to any LDPC code. If the input parity-check matrix is designed to achieve a good performance over the memoryless erasure channel, then the code obtained after the application of the algorithm provides a good joint correction of independent erasures and single erasure bursts. Numerical results are provided in order to show the algorithm effectiveness when applied to different categories of LDPC codes.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.05.070047","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4939204/04939226.pdf","startPage":"1320","endPage":"1328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.05.070047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Construction of Near-Optimum Burst Erasure Correcting Low-Density Parity-Check Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Construction of Near-Optimum Burst Erasure Correcting Low-Density Parity-Check Codes","volume":"57","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10664547","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4939226/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939226/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Construction of Near-Optimum Burst Erasure Correcting Low-Density Parity-Check Codes","sourcePdf":"1320-tc0905-paolini.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114079S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4939204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4939204","articleId":"4939226","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4939227,"authors":[{"name":"Fredrik Rusek","affiliation":["Electrical and Information Technology Department The Swedish Strategic Center for High Speed Wireless Communication, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4939204/4939227/4939227-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fredrik Rusek was born in Lund, Sweden in 1978.

First, by searching into the family of nearest neighbor decoders, which can be easily implemented on most practical coded modulation systems, we derive a decoding metric that minimizes the average of the transmission error probability over all channel estimation errors. Next, we specialize our general expression to obtain the corresponding decoding metric for fading MIMO channels. According to the notion of Estimation-induced outage (EIO) capacity introduced in our previous work and assuming a block Rayleigh-fading channel, we characterize the maximal achievable information rates using Gaussian codebooks associated to the proposed decoder. These achievable rates are compared to the rates achieved by the classical mismatched maximum likelihood (ML) decoder and the ultimate limits given by the EIO capacity. Numerical results show that the derived metric provides significant gains, in terms of achievable EIO rates and bit error rate (BER), in a bit interleaved coded modulation (BICM) framework, without introducing any additional decoding complexity. However, the achievable rates of such metric are still far from the EIO capacity.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4939204/04939228.pdf","startPage":"1341","endPage":"1350","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.070353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.070353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Outage Capacity of a Practical Decoder Accounting for Channel Estimation Inaccuracies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939228/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"On the Outage Capacity of a Practical Decoder Accounting for Channel Estimation Inaccuracies","htmlLink":"/document/4939228/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10664549","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Outage Capacity of a Practical Decoder Accounting for Channel Estimation Inaccuracies","sourcePdf":"1341-tc0905-piantanida.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078122S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4939204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4939204","articleId":"4939228","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4939229,"authors":[{"name":"Leszek Szczecinski","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique, Montreal, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4939204/4939229/4939229-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Leszek Szczecinski (M'98-SM'07), received M.Eng. degree from the Technical University of Warsaw in 1992, and Ph.D. from INRS-Telecommunications, Montreal, Canada in 1997.

For a given transmit power constraint, those points on the boundary of the capacity region can be regarded as the set of optimal operational points. The present work addresses the problem of selecting the point within this set that satisfies given constraints on the ratios between rates achieved by the different users in the network. This problem is usually known as rate balancing. To this end, the optimum iterative approach for general MIMO channels is revisited and adapted to an OFDM transmission scheme. Specifically, an algorithm is proposed that exploits the structure of the OFDM channel and whose convergence speed is essentially insensitive to the number of subcarriers. This is in contrast to a straightforward extension of the general MIMO algorithm to an OFDM scheme. Still, relatively high complexity and the need of a time-sharing policy to reach certain rates are at least two obstacles for a practical implementation of the optimum solution. Based on a novel decomposition technique for broadcast channels a suboptimum non-iterative algorithm is introduced that does not require time-sharing and very closely approaches the optimum solution.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.05.060656","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4939204/04939231.pdf","startPage":"1370","endPage":"1380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.05.060656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate Balancing in Multiuser MIMO OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4939231","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939231/","displayDocTitle":"Rate Balancing in Multiuser MIMO OFDM Systems","volume":"57","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10664552","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4939231/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate Balancing in Multiuser MIMO OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"1370-tc0905-tejera.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122743S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4939204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4939204","articleId":"4939231","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4939234,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden","Access Linnaeus Center, School of Electrical Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4939204/4939234/4939234-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ming Xiao (S\u201902-M\u201907) was born in the SiChuan Province, P.

The network consists of statistically independent noisy channels. The sink bit error probability (BEP) is the performance measure. First, we investigate soft-decision decoding without statistical information on the upstream channels (the channels not directly connected to the sink). Numerical results show that the decoder cannot significantly improve the performance from a hard-decision decoder. We develop union bounds for analysis. The bounds show the asymptotic (regarding SNR: signal-to-noise ratio) performance of the decoder. Using statistical information about the upstream channels, we can find the error patterns of final hop channels (channels directly connected to sinks).With the error patterns, maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding can be performed, and a significant improvement in the BEP is obtained. To evaluate the union bound for the ML decoder, we use an equivalent point procedure. It is reduced to the least-squares problem with a linear constraint in the medium-to-high SNR region. With deterministic knowledge of the errors in the upstream channels, a genie-aided decoder can further improve the performance. We give the union bound for the genie decoder, which is straightforward to evaluate. By analyzing these decoders, we find that knowledge about the upstream channels is essential for good sink decoding.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.05.070201","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4939204/04939234.pdf","startPage":"1402","endPage":"1412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.05.070201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Decoding and Performance Analysis of a Noisy Channel Network with Network Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4939234","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939234/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Decoding and Performance Analysis of a Noisy Channel Network with Network Coding","volume":"57","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10664555","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4939234/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Decoding and Performance Analysis of a Noisy Channel Network with Network Coding","sourcePdf":"1402-tc0905-xiao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102717S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4939204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"4939204","articleId":"4939234","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4939236,"authors":[{"name":"Babak M.

In the proposed system the users of the network are categorized into multiple classes. Users of each class transmit at the same power level but different from the levels of the other classes' users. Using a combination of optical OR, AND and XNOR logic gates for the receiver structure we show that such a network not only takes the full advantages of all-optical signal processing but also demonstrates a considerable throughput efficiency when compared to ordinary FO-CDMA systems. The proposed receiver structure mitigates the effect of interfering users from the other classes by rejecting some specified power level combinations from the other classes. The depth of interference cancellation is a function of the corresponding number of power levels and the number of stages applied to the optical logic gates in use. In our analysis we choose the generalized form of optical orthogonal codes (OOC), i.e., OOCs with cross-correlation value greater than one, as the signature sequence. We begin by emphasizing on two-level systems, that is, when the users can select one out of two power levels for signal transmission. However, for multilevel FO-CDMA we obtain a closed-form relation for the upper bound on the probability of error.We will show that under the ideal case the increase in throughput resulting from the proposed multilevel system is proportional to the number of classes or power levels in use. Our analytical results are compared to the results of an extensive system simulation. The numerical closeness between, the analytical and system simulation, indicates the accuracy with which we have modeled mathematically our proposed signaling using advanced binary optical logic gates in FO-CDMA.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.05.070292","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4939204/04939236.pdf","startPage":"1424","endPage":"1432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.05.070292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiclass, Multistage, and Multilevel Fiber-Optic CDMA Signaling Techniques Based on Advanced Binary Optical Logic Gate Elements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4939236","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939236/","displayDocTitle":"Multiclass, Multistage, and Multilevel Fiber-Optic CDMA Signaling Techniques Based on Advanced Binary Optical Logic Gate Elements","volume":"57","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10664557","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4939236/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiclass, Multistage, and Multilevel Fiber-Optic CDMA Signaling Techniques Based on Advanced Binary Optical Logic Gate Elements","sourcePdf":"1424-tc0905-ghaffari.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064736S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4939204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4939204","articleId":"4939236","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4939238,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaolong Jin","affiliation":["Department of Computing, School of Informatics, University of Bradford, Bradford, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4939204/4939238/4939238-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaolong Jin is currently with the Department of Computing, University of Bradford, as a postdoctoral research assistant.

Due to its fractal-like nature, performance modelling of self-similar traffic poses greater challenges and exhibits more complexity than that of traditional non-bursty traffic. As a result, most existing studies on analytical modelling of priority queueing systems with self-similar inputs have been restricted to a simplified scenario where only two traffic flows are taken into account. This study contributes to performance modelling of priority queueing systems by proposing a novel queue-decomposition approach, which offers several potential advantages and unique innovations. Specifically, we extend the well-known empty buffer approximation (EBA) method to model priority queueing systems with multiple traffic flows and decompose the original priority queueing system into a group of single-server single-queue systems, which can make the challenging performance modelling problem tractable. We further develop an analytical model to investigate the queue length distributions of individual traffic flows. The validity and accuracy of the model demonstrated through extensive simulation experiments make it a practical and cost-effective evaluation tool for quantitatively evaluating the performance behavior of priority queueing systems with multi-class self-similar traffic under various working conditions.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.05.070376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939204","startPage":"1444","endPage":"1452","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4939204/04939238.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling and Analysis of Priority Queueing Systems with Multi-Class Self-Similar Network Traffic: A Novel and Efficient Queue-Decomposition Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939238/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4939238/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modelling and Analysis of Priority Queueing Systems with Multi-Class Self-Similar Network Traffic: A Novel and Efficient Queue-Decomposition Approach","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10664559","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling and Analysis of Priority Queueing Systems with Multi-Class Self-Similar Network Traffic: A Novel and Efficient Queue-Decomposition Approach","sourcePdf":"1444-tc0905-jin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073799S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4939204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4939204","articleId":"4939238","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4939239,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

We circumvent this deficiency by proposing a three-stage turbo-detected Sphere Packing (SP) aided Space-Time Block Coding (STBC) STBC-SP scheme, where a rate-1 recursive inner precoder is employed to avoid having a BER floor. The convergence behaviour of this serially concatenated scheme is investigated with the aid of 3D Extrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) Charts. Furthermore, the capacity of the STBC-SP scheme is determined and an algorithm is proposed for calculating a tighter upper bound on the maximum achievable bandwidth efficiency, based on the EXIT charts of the STBC-SP demapper. The proposed three-stage turbo-detected scheme operates within about 1.0 dB of the capacity and within 0.5 dB of the maximum achievable bandwidth efficiency limit.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.05.060377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.05.060377","startPage":"1486","endPage":"1495","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4939204/04939242.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-Capacity Three-Stage Turbo Detection of Irregular Convolutional Coded Joint Sphere-Packing Modulation and Space-Time Coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939242/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Near-Capacity Three-Stage Turbo Detection of Irregular Convolutional Coded Joint Sphere-Packing Modulation and Space-Time Coding","volume":"57","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10664563","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4939242/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-Capacity Three-Stage Turbo Detection of Irregular Convolutional Coded Joint Sphere-Packing Modulation and Space-Time Coding","sourcePdf":"1486-tc0905-alamri.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113786S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4939204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4939204","articleId":"4939242","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4939244,"authors":[{"name":"Ersin Sengul","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Center for Pervasive Communications and Computing, Henry Samueli School of Engineering, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA","Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4939204/4939244/4939244-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ersin Sengul (S\u201901-M\u201907) received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, in 2001 and the M.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey, in 2003.

Most studies for limited-rate channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) assume that the precoding matrix has an invariance property under an arbitrary unitary transform. In BICMB, this property does not hold. On the other hand, the optimum precoder and detector for BICMB are invariant under a diagonal unitary transform. In order to design a limited-rate CSIT system for BICMB, we propose a new distortion measure optimum under this invariance. Based on this new distortion measure, we introduce a new set of centroids and employ the generalized Lloyd algorithm for codebook design. We provide simulation results demonstrating the performance improvement achieved with the proposed distortion measure and the codebook design for various receivers with linear detectors.We show that although these receivers have the same performance for perfect CSIT, their performance varies under imperfect CSIT.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.05.070237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939204","startPage":"1505","endPage":"1513","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4939204/04939244.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit-Interleaved Coded Multiple Beamforming with Imperfect CSIT","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939244/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4939244/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Bit-Interleaved Coded Multiple Beamforming with Imperfect CSIT","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10664565","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit-Interleaved Coded Multiple Beamforming with Imperfect CSIT","sourcePdf":"1505-tc0905-sengul.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098546S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4939204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4939204","articleId":"4939244","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4939245,"authors":[{"name":"C.K.

If the amount of feedback does not grow with SNR, then there is a sum rate ceiling that increasing the transmit power alone cannot surpass. This paper proposes a simple dual mode system where the base station serves either one user or as many users as the number of transmit antennas. The switching mechanism is smooth and is based on instantaneous system conditions. The mobile determines its preferred transmission mode by using a very simple signal-to-interference-and-noiseratio (SINR) threshold. Based on the mobiles' feedback, the base station chooses the method of signalling accordingly. With a finite number of feedback bits per mobile, it is shown that the proposed system achieves close to the maximum of the sum-rate for single user and multiuser modes. We identify the preferrable mode for an asymptotically large number of users and/or SNR. This proposed architecture is suitable for systems with moderate coherence time, a moderate to large number of users, and a moderate SNR that cannot afford complex processing at the base station or at the mobile.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simple Dual-Mode Limited Feedback Multiuser Downlink System","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.05.070253","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4939204/04939245.pdf","startPage":"1514","endPage":"1522","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.05.070253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939204","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4939245","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939245/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Simple Dual-Mode Limited Feedback Multiuser Downlink System","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4939245/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10664566","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simple Dual-Mode Limited Feedback Multiuser Downlink System","sourcePdf":"1514-tc0905-auyeung.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068585S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4939204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4939204","articleId":"4939245","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4939246,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In many practical applications, however, the CSI must be estimated by sending a limited number of pilot symbols and thus, can suffer from considerable inaccuracy. The influence of CSI inaccuracy on achievable mutual information, though analyzed in the past, is not well understood. The difficulty arises from the presence of a product term of signal and channel estimation error in the received signal model, and the lack of appropriate tools to determine its probability density function. This situation forces the adoption of a bounding technique in current literature by treating the product term either as a signal component or as a noise component. In this paper, we take a different methodology by accurately fitting the received signal with the multivariate Pearson's type-7 (MPT-7) distribution. The new results are simple in expression, very accurate as evidenced by simulation, and capable of directly revealing the dependence of the achievable mutual information on a particular channel estimator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939246/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","volume":"57","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"10664567","publicationDate":"May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4939246/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Mutual Information of Multipath Channels with Imperfect Channel Information","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mutual Information of Multipath Channels with Imperfect Channel Information","sourcePdf":"1523-tc0905-song.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066629S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4939204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4939204","articleId":"4939246","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4939247,"authors":[{"name":"Serdar Sezginer","affiliation":["Sequans Communications, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4939204/4939247/4939247-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Serdar Sezginer (S'99 - M'07) was born in Bandirma, Turkey, in 1977.

The former has full diversity and the latter has full rate, but neither of them has both of these desired features. An alternative 2times2 STC, which is both full rate and full diversity, is the Golden code. It is the best known 2times2 STC, but it has a high decoding complexity. Recently, the attention was turned to the decoder complexity, this issue was included in the STC design criteria, and different STCs were proposed. In this paper, we first present a full-rate full-diversity 2times2 STC design leading to substantially lower complexity of the optimum detector compared to the Golden code with only a slight performance loss. We provide the general optimized form of this STC and show that this scheme achieves the diversity multiplexing frontier for square QAM signal constellations. Then, we present a variant of the proposed STC, which provides a further decrease in the detection complexity with a rate reduction of 25% and show that this provides an interesting trade-off between the Alamouti scheme and SM.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On High-Rate Full-Diversity 2 \u00d7 2 Space-Time Codes with Low-Complexity Optimum Detection","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.05.070643","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4939204/04939247.pdf","startPage":"1532","endPage":"1541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.05.070643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939204","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4939247","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939247/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"On High-Rate Full-Diversity 2 \u00d7 2 Space-Time Codes with Low-Complexity Optimum Detection","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4939247/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10664568","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On High-Rate Full-Diversity 2 \u00d7 2 Space-Time Codes with Low-Complexity Optimum Detection","sourcePdf":"1532-tc0905-sezginer.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055701S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4939204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4939204","articleId":"4939247","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-17"},{"_id":4939287,"authors":[{"name":"Timo Kosch","affiliation":["BMW Group, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Timo Kosch (timo.kosch@bmw.de) works as a team manager at BMW Group Research and Technology.

For more general user distribution, we can obtain numerical results using the codebook design algorithm. Applying the proposed criterion to circular-layout GDAS with uniform user distribution and linear cell with non-uniform user distribution, we achieve near optimal performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/4939326/04939337.pdf","startPage":"315","endPage":"317","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2009.090123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2009.090123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939326","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4939337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna location design for generalized distributed antenna systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rayleigh channels","Vector quantization","Receiving antennas","Algorithm design and analysis","Mobile communication","Working environment noise","Frequency","Large-scale systems","Bit error rate","H infinity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna location design","generalized distributed antenna systems","squared distance criterion","cell averaged ergodic capacity","antenna port locations","randomly distributed user","nearest antenna port","codebook design","vector quantization","circular-layout GDAS","non-uniform user distribution","near optimal performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Generalized distributed antenna system (GDAS), cell averaged ergodic capacity, antenna location design, vector quantization, codebook design."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939337/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Antenna location design for generalized distributed antenna systems","volume":"13","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4939337/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10666478","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna location design for generalized distributed antenna systems","sourcePdf":"315-cl0905-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040491S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"4939326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"4939326","articleId":"4939337","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4939339,"authors":[{"name":"Dae-Young Seol","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dae-Young","lastName":"Seol","id":"37409484500"},{"name":"Tae-Won Yune","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Tae-Won","lastName":"Yune","id":"37391694600"},{"name":"Gi-Hong Im","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Gi-Hong","lastName":"Im","id":"37265558500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"4939339","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognition","OFDM","Spatial databases","Radiofrequency identification","Frequency-selective fading channels","Cognitive radio","Transmitting antennas","Signal detection","Maintenance","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","fading channels","signal detection","space-time codes","spread spectrum communication","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["primary network cognition","spatial diversity signature","dynamic spectrum access","primary signal detection","space-frequency codeword","Alamouti scheme","experiential database","frequency-selective fading channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio, dynamic spectrum access, network identification, spatial diversity, spectrum sensing."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4939339","abstract":"The identification of primary networks improves efficiency in dynamic spectrum access.

The validity of the outage probability expression is confirmed with the numerical results.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2009.090185","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/4939326/04939342.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2009.090185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939326","startPage":"330","endPage":"332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of linear receivers in a MIMO relaying system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4939342","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of linear receivers in a MIMO relaying system","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939342/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10666463","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4939342/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of linear receivers in a MIMO relaying system","sourcePdf":"330-cl0905-chalise.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047959S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"4939326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4939326","articleId":"4939342","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4939343,"authors":[{"name":"Cristhof J.

integrated system is of great importance from both scientific and technological standpoints. Such a system and its possible variants would have numerous applications in a wide spectrum of fields, including defense against biological warfare, disease control, environmental health and safety, and medical treatments. In this paper, we review a comprehensive mixture of optical and computational tools developed in our group aiming at real-time sensing and recognition of biological microorganisms. Digital in-line holographic microscopy is used with both coherent and partially coherent illumination to probe the specimen interferometrically. The interference pattern is then recorded on an optoelectronic image sensor and transferred to a computer where special statistical algorithms are performed to segment, recognize, and track the microorganisms within the field of view of the microscope. The advantages of proposed holographic sensing are described compared to conventional two-dimensional imaging systems. In addition, the theoretical aspects and fundamental limitations of digital in-line holographic microscopy are discussed, which determine the relationship between system parameters and achievable performance. The proposed optical-digital integrated system for automated, real-time sensing and recognition of biological microorganisms has been deemed promising with the potential of widespread application. We demonstrate how the proposed techniques function together in a series of experiments.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2009.2017563","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/4939392/04939403.pdf","startPage":"990","endPage":"1010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2009.2017563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Three-Dimensional Identification and Tracking of Micro/Nanobiological Organisms by Computational Holographic Microscopy","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939403/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Automated Three-Dimensional Identification and Tracking of Micro/Nanobiological Organisms by Computational Holographic Microscopy","volume":"97","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10664132","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Three-Dimensional Identification and Tracking of Micro/Nanobiological Organisms by Computational Holographic Microscopy","sourcePdf":"jproc-moon-2017563.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048039S","chronDate":"June  2009","isNumber":"4939392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"70","articleId":"4939403","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4939406,"authors":[{"name":"Michael T.

This paper explores the application to civilian search and rescue, using the airborne real-time cueing hyperspectral enhanced reconnaissance (ARCHER) system developed for the civil air patrol as a key example of how evolving hyperspectral technology can be employed to support these operations. ARCHER combines a visible/near-infrared hyperspectral imaging system, a high-resolution visible panchromatic imaging sensor, and an integrated geopositioning and inertial navigation unit with onboard real-time processing for data acquisition and correction, precision image georegistration, and target detection and cueing. Processing for detecting downed aircraft wreckage and other related objects employs real-time adaptive anomaly detection and matched filtering algorithms, and a non-real-time change detection mode to provide further false alarm reduction in some instances.

The extension of this paradigm to mobile, long-range networks has long been a desire by the military communications community for multigigabit mobile backbone networks. The FSO communications subsystem has historically been the primary limitation. The challenge has been addressing the compensation of propagation effects and dynamic range of the received optical signal. This paper will address the various technologies required to compensate for the effects referenced above. We will outline the effects FSO and RF links experience and how we overcome these degradations.

An early approach was birefringent liquid crystals writing a sawtooth phase profile in one polarization, using 2pi resets. Liquid crystals were used because of high birefringence. Fringing fields associated with voltage control required to implement the 2pi resets have limited the efficiency and steering angle of this beam steering approach. Because of steering angle limitations, this conventional liquid crystal steering approach is usually combined with a large angle step-steering approach. Volume holograms, birefringent prisms or sawtooth-profile birefringent phase gratings, and circular-type polarization gratings are the large angle step steering approaches that will be reviewed in this paper. Alternate steering approaches to the combined liquid crystal and step-steering approach exist. Microelectromechanical system mirrors, lenslet arrays, electrowetting, and a variable birefringent grating approach will be reviewed and compared against the conventional liquid crystal and step-steering approaches. Step-steering approaches can also be combined with these approaches. Multiple nonmechanical steering approaches are developing that will allow high-efficiency steering, excellent steering accuracy, and wide fields of view.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939392","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/4939392/04939409.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2009.2017218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2009.2017218","startPage":"1078","endPage":"1096","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Review of Phased Array Steering for Narrow-Band Electrooptical Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939409/","displayDocTitle":"A Review of Phased Array Steering for Narrow-Band Electrooptical Systems","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4939409/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"97","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"10664139","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Review of Phased Array Steering for Narrow-Band Electrooptical Systems","sourcePdf":"jproc-mcmanamon-2017218.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.202121S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"4939392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"223","xplore-issue":"4939392","articleId":"4939409","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4939424,"authors":[{"name":"Balachander Narasimhan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Balachander","lastName":"Narasimhan","id":"38276591600"},{"name":"Dandan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Dandan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292142500"},{"name":"Sudharsan Narayanan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Sudharsan","lastName":"Narayanan","id":"38276975400"},{"name":"Hlaing Minn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Hlaing","lastName":"Minn","id":"37269620000"},{"name":"Naofal Al-Dhahir","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Naofal","lastName":"Al-Dhahir","id":"37269044000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1932-4553"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0484"}],"articleNumber":"4939424","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":625},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Baseband","Frequency estimation","Power system reliability","Fabrication","Closed-form solution","Degradation","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","intercarrier interference","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital compensation","frequency-dependent joint Tx-Rx I/Q imbalance","OFDM channel estimation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","analog processing","intercarrier interference","ICI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) imbalance","inter-carrier interference (ICI)","minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalization","mobility","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)"]}],"abstract":"Direct conversion orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems suffer from transmit and receive analog processing impairments such as in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) imbalance causing inter-carrier interference (ICI) among sub-carriers. Another source of performance-limiting ICI in OFDM systems is Doppler spread due to mobility. However, the nature of ICI due to each of them is quite different. Unlike previous work which considered these two impairments separately, we develop a unified mathematical framework to characterize, estimate, and jointly mitigate ICI due to I/Q imbalance and high mobility. Based on our general model, we derive a closed-form expression for the degradation in signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) due to the impairments. Moreover, we exploit the special ICI structure to design efficient OFDM channel estimation and digital baseband compensation schemes for joint transmit/receive frequency-independent (FI) and frequency-dependent (FD) I/Q imbalances under high-mobility conditions.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2020325","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/4939420/04939424.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2020325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939420","startPage":"405","endPage":"417","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital Compensation of Frequency-Dependent Joint Tx/Rx I/Q Imbalance in OFDM Systems Under High Mobility","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4939424","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Digital Compensation of Frequency-Dependent Joint Tx/Rx I/Q Imbalance in OFDM Systems Under High Mobility","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939424/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10664310","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Compensation of Frequency-Dependent Joint Tx/Rx I/Q Imbalance in OFDM Systems Under High Mobility","sourcePdf":"03jstsp03-bnarasimhan-2020325.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045299S","chronDate":"June  2009","isNumber":"4939420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"51","articleId":"4939424","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4939430,"authors":[{"name":"Sungho Choi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/4939420/4939430/4939430-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sungho Choi (S'05) received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2007, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in KAIST.","His research interests are in the area of communication signal processing, which include synchronization, detection, and estimation for wireless communication systems.

A two-step identification scheme, wherein the linear portion is estimated first and the nonlinear portion is then identified, is developed. The PD is modeled by a polynomial and its coefficients are directly updated using a recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm. To avoid implementing the inverse of the PA's linear portion, the cost function for the RLS algorithm is defined as the sum of differences between the output of the PA's linear portion and the inverse of the PA's nonlinear portion. The proposed direct learning scheme, which is referred to as the piecewise RLS (PWRLS) algorithm, is simpler to implement, yet exhibits comparable performance, as compared with existing direct learning schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/4939420/04939430.pdf","startPage":"397","endPage":"404","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2020265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2020265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939420","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4939430","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Predistortion With Direct Learning Based on Piecewise Linear Approximation of Amplifier Nonlinearity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predistortion","Piecewise linear approximation","Resonance light scattering","Power amplifiers","Nonlinear filters","Least squares approximation","Piecewise linear techniques","Polynomials","Least squares methods","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least mean squares methods","piecewise linear techniques","power amplifiers","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive predistortion","piecewise linear approximation","amplifier nonlinearity","Wiener model","power amplifier","direct learning predistorter","linear filter","memoryless nonlinearity","piecewise constant functions","recursive least squares algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Direct learning","piecewise linear","polynomial","power amplifier (PA)","predistortion","Wiener model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939430/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Predistortion With Direct Learning Based on Piecewise Linear Approximation of Amplifier Nonlinearity","volume":"3","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4939430/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10664311","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Predistortion With Direct Learning Based on Piecewise Linear Approximation of Amplifier Nonlinearity","sourcePdf":"jstsp-jeong-2020265.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067488S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"4939420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4939420","articleId":"4939430","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4939431,"authors":[{"name":"Gernot Hueber","affiliation":["Danube Integrated Circuit Engineering, Linz, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/4939420/4939431/4939431-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gernot Hueber (M'05) received the Dipl.-Ing. degree (Master) in mechatronics and the Dr.Tech. degree (Ph.D.) from the Johannes-Kepler University, Linz, Austria, in 2000 and 2006, respectively.","From 2000 to 2006, he was with the Research Institute for Integrated Circuits (RIIC), where he started the Ph.D. degree in the field of concept and design of RF front-ends for multimode cellular terminals.

At the same time, the demands on the remaining analog circuits are greatly increased, especially with lower power supplies and nanoscale technology effects such as variability. With the terminal users requesting high radio performance and data rates, and low power consumption on one hand, and terminal flexibility and reduced implementation costs on the other hand, the requirements for these remaining analog front-end stages become extremely challenging to meet. As a result, one interesting idea is to complement analog radio-frequency (RF) circuits with smart signal-processing algorithms to digitally enhanced RF circuits. In this paper, we focus on developing and demonstrating novel signal-processing techniques intended for the analog and digital front-ends of future low-power, flexible radios. One key aspect in the work is power-efficient digital front-end design with great flexibility for digital selectivity filtering and sample rate alteration. Another key ingredient is the analysis and mitigation of different analog RF impairments, with special emphasis on I/Q imbalance effects and second-order intermodulation (IM2) distortion in wideband multicarrier or multichannel radio receivers. The approach used in this work generally draws from the practical system performance specifications. Overall, our results clearly indicate that the proposed compensation techniques can be used to suppress I/Q imbalance and IM2 distortion effects in receiver front-end sections under realistic signaling assumptions. The adaptivity and flexibility offered by the overall digital front-end design greatly reduces the power consumption of the radio.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2020576","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/4939420/04939431.pdf","startPage":"472","endPage":"487","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2020576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart Front-End Signal Processing for Advanced Wireless Receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4939431","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939431/","displayDocTitle":"Smart Front-End Signal Processing for Advanced Wireless Receivers","volume":"3","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10664318","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4939431/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart Front-End Signal Processing for Advanced Wireless Receivers","sourcePdf":"jstsp-hueber-2020576.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133428S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"4939420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4939420","articleId":"4939431","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4939432,"authors":[{"name":"H\u00c5kan Johansson","affiliation":["Division of Electronics Systems Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/4939420/4939432/4939432-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["H\u00e5kan Johansson (S'97\u2013M'98\u2013SM'06) was born in Kumla, Sweden, in 1969.

are time-interleaved. The distortion generated by time-interleaved ADCs is now not only a function of the nonlinear behavior of the constituent circuitry, but also mismatches associated with interleaving multiple output streams. To mitigate distortion generated by time-interleaved ADCs, we have developed a polyphase NonLinear EQualizer (pNLEQ) which is capable of simultaneously mitigating distortion generated by both the on-chip circuitry and mismatches due to time interleaving. In this paper, we describe the pNLEQ architecture and present measurements of its performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939436/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4939436/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10664321","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Polyphase Nonlinear Equalization of Time-Interleaved Analog-to-Digital Converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polyphase Nonlinear Equalization of Time-Interleaved Analog-to-Digital Converters","sourcePdf":"jstsp-goodman-2020243.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101865S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"4939420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4939420","articleId":"4939436","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4939437,"authors":[{"name":"Kai-Yuan Jheng","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/4939420/4939437/4939437-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kai-Yuan Jheng (S'04) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the National Central University, Jhongli City, Taiwan, in 2001 and 2003, respectively.

As for the PA linearization technique, linear amplifier with nonlinear components (LINC), achieves linear amplification without power backoff. However, the combiner power efficiency of the LINC system degrades significantly for signals with a high peak-to-average power ratio. In this paper, we propose a multilevel out-phasing (MOP) scheme to achieve high combiner efficiency by reducing the signal dynamics. Furthermore, based on the MOP, we design two architectures: envelope-adjusting MLINC (EA-MLINC) and gain-adjusting MLINC (GA-MLINC). Under the WCDMA system linearity requirements, the simulations show that 3-level EA-MLINC and 3-level GA-MLINC enhance the LINC system power-added efficiency from 16.5% to 33.4% and 23.6%, respectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilevel LINC System Designs for Power Efficiency Enhancement of Transmitters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2020949","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/4939420/04939437.pdf","startPage":"523","endPage":"532","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2020949","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939420","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4939437","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939437/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Multilevel LINC System Designs for Power Efficiency Enhancement of Transmitters","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4939437/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10664313","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilevel LINC System Designs for Power Efficiency Enhancement of Transmitters","sourcePdf":"03jstsp03-kjheng-2020949.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166284S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"4939420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4939420","articleId":"4939437","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4939438,"authors":[{"name":"Kuang-Yu Sung","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/4939420/4939438/4939438-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kuang-Yu Sung (S'05) was born in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1980.

The digital post-processing scheme uses circuit insight and judicious modeling of the relevant nonidealities to minimize complexity. We show that the number of coefficients required in our model is significantly smaller than the number of coefficients in the general form of the Volterra series. The coefficients are extracted in a foreground calibration approach using least square (LS) solutions on a set of input and output samples from training signals.

A major disadvantage of OFDM is the large dynamic range of its time-domain waveforms, making OFDM vulnerable to nonlinearities (including clipping effects) of the power amplifier (PA) and causing the PA to yield low efficiency on the RF to dc power conversion. A commonly used metric to characterize a signal's dynamic range is the peak-to-average power ratio (PAR). To suppress the nonlinear effects, one may want to reduce the signal PAR. However, this results in the increase of error vector magnitude (EVM), and may violate the spectral mask. In this paper, we formulate the problem as an EVM optimization task subject to a deterministic PAR constraint and a spectral mask constraint. A low-complexity customized interior-point algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problem. We also discuss extensions of the optimization framework, whereby we optimize the parameters with respect to two metrics on signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) and mutual information, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2020239","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/4939420/04939440.pdf","startPage":"418","endPage":"429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2020239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error Vector Magnitude Optimization for OFDM Systems With a Deterministic Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Constraint","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4939440","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939440/","displayDocTitle":"Error Vector Magnitude Optimization for OFDM Systems With a Deterministic Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Constraint","volume":"3","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10664315","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4939440/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Vector Magnitude Optimization for OFDM Systems With a Deterministic Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Constraint","sourcePdf":"jstsp-liu-2020239.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079583S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"4939420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4939420","articleId":"4939440","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4939441,"authors":[{"name":"Qiyue Zou","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/4939420/4939441/4939441-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qiyue Zou (S'06\u2013M'09) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in electrical and electronic engineering from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, in 2001 and 2004, respectively, and the M.A. degree in mathematics and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in 2008.","From 2001 to 2004, he was with the Centre for Signal Processing, NTU, Singapore, working on statistical and array signal processing.

In the presence of strong blocker (interference) signals, such nonlinearities introduce severe cross modulation over the desired signals. This paper investigates how the cross-modulation distortion can be compensated for by using digital signal processing techniques. In the proposed solution, the SDR scans the wide spectrum and locates the desired signal and strong blocker signals. After down-converting these signals separately to the baseband, the baseband processor processes them jointly to mitigate the cross-modulation interferences. As a result, the sensitivity of the wideband RF receiver to the nonlinearity impairment can be significantly lowered, simplifying the RF and analog circuitry design in terms of implementation cost and power consumption. The proposed approach also demonstrates how mixed-signal, i.e., joint analog and digital, processing techniques play a critical role in the emerging SDR and cognitive radio technologies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939441/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4939441/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10664323","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Digital Compensation of Cross-Modulation Distortion in Software-Defined Radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Compensation of Cross-Modulation Distortion in Software-Defined Radios","sourcePdf":"jstsp-zou-2020266.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062828S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"4939420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4939420","articleId":"4939441","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4939442,"authors":[{"name":"Vijay Divi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/4939420/4939442/4939442-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vijay Divi (S'02\u2013M'08) received the B.S., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, in 2002, 2004, and 2008, respectively, all in electrical engineering and computer science.","His research is in the area of distributed sampling algorithms and applications to high-speed A/D conversion and broader interests include topics in signal processing, estimation, optimization, communication systems, and circuit design.

The adoption of strong channel coding techniques appears to be of key importance for mobile operators and broadcasters. Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes have been widely considered as error-correcting codes for next generation communication systems. A good LDPC decoder design requires both implementation friendly LDPC codes and efficient decoder architectures. The quality of LDPC code is crucial in determining the coding gain and implementation complexity of LDPC hardware decoders. This paper presents a turbo-decoding message-passing algorithm (TDMP) based LDPC code search algorithm with hardware considerations. The main advantages of the proposed algorithm over the DMB-TH standard decoding algorithm are 1) improvement in coding gain by an order of magnitude at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), 2) reduced decoder complexity. The performance of the proposed TDMP architecture is shown by the comparison of simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/ICIT.2009.4939498","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912735/4939482/04939498.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIT.2009.4939498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study on the decoding algorithm for LDPC based on DMB-TH","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4939498","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939498/","displayDocTitle":"Study on the decoding algorithm for LDPC based on DMB-TH","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10661090","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4939498/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study on the decoding algorithm for LDPC based on DMB-TH","confLoc":"Churchill, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"AF-002046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049635S","chronDate":"10-13 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912735","isNumber":"4939482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912735","xplore-issue":"4939482","articleId":"4939498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4939514,"authors":[{"name":"R.

It is investigated the performance of a supplementary damping controller (SDC) added to the reactive power control scheme. The SDC is designed by a robust control technique structured in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The main objectives, from the application viewpoint, are the improvements of the damping of oscillations in tie-lines (precisely, voltage and active power flow oscillations which are related to the presence of inter-area oscillations mode), and also, the minimization of their peak values during transients. The tests were realized in a two-area four-machine power system, and the results show the proposed control scheme presents a good performance for several different operating points.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939482","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912735/4939482/04939514.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICIT.2009.4939514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIT.2009.4939514","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control design of a STATCOM with Energy Storage System for stability and power quality improvements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939514/","displayDocTitle":"Control design of a STATCOM with Energy Storage System for stability and power quality improvements","htmlLink":"/document/4939514/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Feb. 2009","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10661106","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control design of a STATCOM with Energy Storage System for stability and power quality improvements","confLoc":"Churchill, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"AF-003573.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082673S","chronDate":"10-13 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912735","isNumber":"4939482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912735","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4939482","articleId":"4939514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4939525,"authors":[{"name":"Jinsheng Wang","affiliation":["Laboratoire de G\u00e9nie Industriel et de Production M\u00e9canique, Universit\u00e9 de Paul Verlaine, Metz, France","Laboratory of Advanced Manufacturing, Automation Northeastern University, Shenyang, China","Laboratoire de G\u00e9nie Industriel et de Production M\u00e9canique, Universit\u00e9 de Paul Verlaine, Metz, France"],"firstName":"Jinsheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37634917200"},{"name":"Yadong Gong","affiliation":["Laboratory of Advanced Manufacturing, Automation Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Yadong","lastName":"Gong","id":"37628469400"},{"name":"Jiashun Shi","affiliation":["Laboratory of Advanced Manufacturing, Automation Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Jiashun","lastName":"Shi","id":"37533991000"},{"name":"Gabriel Abbay","affiliation":["Laboratoire de G\u00e9nie Industriel et de Production M\u00e9canique, Universit\u00e9 de Paul Verlaine, Metz, 57070, France"],"firstName":"Gabriel","lastName":"Abbay","id":"37088012362"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3506-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3507-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4939525","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":297},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4939525","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rough surfaces","Surface roughness","Neural networks","Machining","Predictive models","Solid modeling","Surface discharges","Manufacturing automation","Production","Milling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design of experiments","machine tool spindles","micromachining","milling","neural nets","surface roughness","Taguchi methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["surface roughness","micromilling operation","neural network","Taguchi design of experiments","spindle speed effect","tool radial error motion","interaction effect"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIT.2009.4939525","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912735/4939482/04939525.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIT.2009.4939525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Surface roughness prediction in micromilling using neural networks and Taguchi's design of experiments","abstract":"The present research is to analyze the effects of spindle speed (n), feedrate (\u0192) and axial depth of cut (aP ) on average surface roughness parameters (R\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a</inf>\n) in the micromilling operation.

The proposed controller is composed of a DC-link voltage sub-controller to keep the DC-bus voltage constant, a Terminal voltage sub-controller to maintain the StatCom output voltage closed to a predefined value, a Neutral-point subcontroller to stabilize the neutral point and two Auxiliary subcontrollers to equalize the voltage across the capacitors.

The static compensator is capable of regulating its terminal voltage with a controllable droop characteristic.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIT.2009.4939575","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912735/4939482/04939575.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/ICIT.2009.4939575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and control of a five-level Diode-Clamped Converter based StatCom","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and control of a five-level Diode-Clamped Converter based StatCom","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Feb. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4939575/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10661166","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939575/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and control of a five-level Diode-Clamped Converter based StatCom","confLoc":"Churchill, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"AF-008788.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046688S","chronDate":"10-13 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912735","isNumber":"4939482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912735","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4939482","articleId":"4939575","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4939590,"authors":[{"name":"Iman Sadinezhad","affiliation":["University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Iman","lastName":"Sadinezhad","id":"37393487800"},{"name":"Vassilios G.

In order to overcome the two drawbacks the LC filter brings, an improved control method for PWM current source rectifier with active damping function is proposed in this paper. The proposed power factor control method is based on the source voltage oriented d-q rotating frame, which is parameters insensitive and can make the rectifier get the maximum achievable power factor. Meanwhile, in order to suppress the LC resonance and to reduce the line current total harmonic distortion (THD) without the physical damping resistor, the active damping technique is adopted, which is realized together with the power factor control, directly through detecting the capacitor voltage. All these analyses and the effectiveness of the control method are firstly demonstrated by simulation results, and are verified further in a 5kVA laboratory prototype.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIT.2009.4939633","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912735/4939482/04939633.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/ICIT.2009.4939633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved control method for PWM current source rectifier with active damping function","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"An improved control method for PWM current source rectifier with active damping function","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Feb. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4939633/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10661224","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939633/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved control method for PWM current source rectifier with active damping function","confLoc":"Churchill, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"AF-011657.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049922S","chronDate":"10-13 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912735","isNumber":"4939482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912735","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4939482","articleId":"4939633","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4939634,"authors":[{"name":"Jinhee Lee","affiliation":["Facility & Automation Research Center, Research Institute of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jinhee Lee","id":"37087259206"},{"name":"Se-Young Oh","affiliation":["Department of Electronic & Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Se-Young","lastName":"Oh","id":"37279131000"},{"name":"Chintae Choi","affiliation":["Facility & Automation Research Center, Research Institute of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"lastName":"Chintae Choi","id":"37087180383"},{"name":"Heedon Jeong","affiliation":["Facility & Automation Research Center, Research Institute of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"lastName":"Heedon Jeong","id":"37087906736"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3506-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3507-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4939634","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Neural networks","Pumps","Fluid flow measurement","Fluid flow","Iterative algorithms","Temperature sensors","Competitive intelligence","State estimation","Large-scale systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","neural nets","pipe flow","pumps","turbulence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flow estimation","genetic algorithm","neural network","parallel driven pump","bended pipe","fluid turbulence","fitness function","pump flow"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4939634","abstract":"The paper presents flow estimation method of parallel driven pumps with bended pipes near pumps' output parts.

Inductive modeling methodologies are beneficial for modeling the systems where the uncertainties involved in the system do not permit to obtain an accurate physical model. However inductive models, like artificial neural networks (ANNs), may suffer from a few drawbacks involving over-fitting and the difficulty to easily understand the model itself. This can result in user reluctance to accept the model or even complete rejection of the modeling results. Thus, it becomes highly desirable to make such inductive models more comprehensible and to automatically determine the model complexity to avoid over-fitting. In this paper, we propose a novel type of ANN, a mixed transfer function artificial neural network (MTFANN), which aims to improve the complexity fitting and comprehensibility of the most popular type of ANN (MLP - a Multilayer Perceptron).","doi":"10.1109/ICIT.2009.4939662","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912735/4939482/04939662.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIT.2009.4939662","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mixed transfer function neural networks for knowledge acquisition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transfer functions","Neural networks","Knowledge acquisition","Artificial neural networks","Neurons","Multilayer perceptrons","Technological innovation","Australia","Electronic mail","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","knowledge acquisition","multilayer perceptrons","neural nets","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural networks","knowledge acquisition","mixed transfer function artificial neural network","multilayer perceptron"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["inductive modeling","neural networks","mixed transfer functions","over-fitting","model complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939662/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Mixed transfer function neural networks for knowledge acquisition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4939662/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","conferenceDate":"10-13 Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10661253","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mixed transfer function neural networks for knowledge acquisition","confLoc":"Churchill, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"AF-013285.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060896S","chronDate":"10-13 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912735","isNumber":"4939482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912735","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4939482","articleId":"4939662","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4939663,"authors":[{"name":"Mahendra Kumar Samal","affiliation":["School of Aerospace, Civil and Mechanical Engineering, University of New South Wales, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Mahendra Kumar","lastName":"Samal","id":"37644543100"},{"name":"Sreenatha Anavatti","affiliation":["School of Aerospace, Civil and Mechanical Engineering, University of New South Wales, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Sreenatha","lastName":"Anavatti","id":"37563207000"},{"name":"Matthew Garratt","affiliation":["School of Aerospace, Civil and Mechanical Engineering, University of New South Wales, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Garratt","id":"37299691600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3506-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3507-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4939663","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":240},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4939663","abstract":"Real time flight implementation of a neural network based black-box identification (NNID) scheme to a rotary wing unmanned aerial vehicle (RUAV) is presented in this paper.

This paper applies ANN based predictive and adaptive reference generation technique. Predictive scheme extracts the information of the fundamental component through an ANN that replaces a low pass filter. This ANN based low pass-filter is trained offline with large number of training set to predict the fundamental magnitude of load current. This predictive reference generation technique works well for clean source voltage. However, the performance deteriorates in case of distortion in source voltage and also with noise. To overcome this, an Adaline based ANN is applied after the operation of the predictive algorithm. It has been shown that the combined predictive-adaptive approach offers better performance. Simulation results and experimental results are presented to confirm the usefulness of the proposed technique..","doi":"10.1109/ICIT.2009.4939725","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912735/4939482/04939725.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIT.2009.4939725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Harmonic elimination and reactive power compensation through a shunt active power filter by twin neural networks with predictive and adaptive properties","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939725/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Harmonic elimination and reactive power compensation through a shunt active power filter by twin neural networks with predictive and adaptive properties","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10661316","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4939725/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Feb. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harmonic elimination and reactive power compensation through a shunt active power filter by twin neural networks with predictive and adaptive properties","confLoc":"Churchill, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"AF-018813.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058346S","chronDate":"10-13 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912735","isNumber":"4939482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912735","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4939482","articleId":"4939725","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4939728,"authors":[{"name":"S.

However, the FS-MPC presents some drawbacks as non constant switching frequency and high sampling frequency. This work proposes a FS-MPC with constant switching frequency and low sampling frequency applying a discrete space vector modulation (DSVM) technique. The real state vectors of the converter are used together with new virtual state vectors forming switching sequences each sampling period. The advantages and disadvantages of the proposed FS-MPC with the DSVM are analyzed using a two-level three-phase inverter connected to the grid as setup to introduce the proposed technique. Simulation results are presented, showing that using the proposed technique the switching frequency is fixed and the sampling frequency can be lowered without reducing the quality of the converter behavior.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912735/4939482/04939728.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICIT.2009.4939728","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIT.2009.4939728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939482","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4939728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Predictive Control with constant switching frequency using a Discrete Space Vector Modulation with virtual state vectors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Predictive control","Switching frequency","Sampling methods","Inverters","Rectifiers","Motor drives","Torque control","Switching converters","Uninterruptible power systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete systems","power convertors","predictive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model predictive control","constant switching frequency","discrete space vector modulation","virtual state vectors","power converters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939728/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Model Predictive Control with constant switching frequency using a Discrete Space Vector Modulation with virtual state vectors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4939728/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10661319","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","conferenceDate":"10-13 Feb. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Predictive Control with constant switching frequency using a Discrete Space Vector Modulation with virtual state vectors","confLoc":"Churchill, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"AF-019089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069578S","chronDate":"10-13 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912735","isNumber":"4939482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912735","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"4939482","articleId":"4939728","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4939742,"authors":[{"name":"Patricio Cortes","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering Department, Universidad T\u00e8cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valparaiso, Chile"],"firstName":"Patricio","lastName":"Cortes","id":"37275248400"},{"name":"Samir Kouro","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering Department, Universidad T\u00e8cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valparaiso, Chile"],"firstName":"Samir","lastName":"Kouro","id":"37270051000"},{"name":"Bruno La Rocca","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering Department, Universidad T\u00e8cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valparaiso, Chile"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"La Rocca","id":"37643912800"},{"name":"Rene Vargas","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering Department, Universidad T\u00e8cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valparaiso, Chile"],"firstName":"Rene","lastName":"Vargas","id":"37294463800"},{"name":"Jose Rodriguez","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering Department, Universidad T\u00e8cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valparaiso, Chile"],"firstName":"Jose","lastName":"Rodriguez","id":"37279149900"},{"name":"Jose I.

One of the major advantages is the possibility to control several system variables with a single control law, by including them with appropriate weighting factors. However, at the present state of the art, these coefficients are determined empirically. There is no analytical or numerical method proposed yet to obtain an optimal solution. In addition, the empirical method is not always straightforward, and no procedures have been reported. This paper presents a first approach to a set of guidelines that reduce the uncertainty of this process. First a classification of different types of cost functions and weighting factors is presented. Then the different steps of the empirical process are explained. Finally, results for several power converters and drives applications are analyzed, which show the effectiveness of the proposed guidelines to reach appropriate weighting factors and control performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICIT.2009.4939742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIT.2009.4939742","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912735/4939482/04939742.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Guidelines for weighting factors design in Model Predictive Control of power converters and drives","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4939742/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Feb. 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Guidelines for weighting factors design in Model Predictive Control of power converters and drives","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10661333","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4939742/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guidelines for weighting factors design in Model Predictive Control of power converters and drives","confLoc":"Churchill, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"AF-019682.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083369S","chronDate":"10-13 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912735","isNumber":"4939482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912735","citationCount":"383","xplore-issue":"4939482","articleId":"4939742","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"}]
