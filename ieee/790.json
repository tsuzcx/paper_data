Recently, features extracted from top layers of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a large annotated dataset, e.g., ImageNet, have been proven to be strong off-the-shelf descriptors for various recognition tasks. However, large disparity among the pre-trained task, i.e., ImageNet classification, and the target task, i.e., person image matching, limits performances of the CNN features for person re-identification. In this paper, we improve the CNN features by conducting a fine-tuning on a pedestrian attribute dataset. In addition to the classification loss for multiple pedestrian attribute labels, we propose new labels by combining different attribute labels and use them for an additional classification loss function. The combination attribute loss forces CNN to distinguish more person specific information, yielding more discriminative features. After extracting features from the learned CNN, we apply conventional metric learning on a target re-identification dataset for further increasing discriminative power. Experimental results on four challenging person re-identification datasets (VIPeR, CUHK, PRID450S and GRID) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed features.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900000/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16824352","htmlLink":"/document/7900000/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Person re-identification using CNN features learned from combination of attributes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Person re-identification using CNN features learned from combination of attributes","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"1686.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070829S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7893644","isNumber":"7899596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7893644","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"7899596","articleId":"7900000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":7900002,"authors":[{"name":"Neslihan Bayramoglu","affiliation":["Center for Machine Vision and Signal Analysis, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Neslihan","lastName":"Bayramoglu","id":"38196055200"},{"name":"Juho Kannala","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Aalto University, Finland"],"firstName":"Juho","lastName":"Kannala","id":"37266152600"},{"name":"Janne Heikkil\u00e4","affiliation":["Center for Machine Vision and Signal Analysis, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Janne","lastName":"Heikkil\u00e4","id":"37269926400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4847-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4848-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7900002","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":110,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2561},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Breast cancer","Microscopy","Pathology","Databases","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancer","computer vision","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep learning","magnification independent breast cancer histopathology image classification","microscopic analysis","breast tissues","digital imaging techniques","computer vision","machine learning","diagnostic pathology workflow","image classification","convolutional neural networks","single task CNN","multitask CNN","BreaKHis dataset"]}],"abstract":"Microscopic analysis of breast tissues is necessary for a definitive diagnosis of breast cancer which is the most common cancer among women. Pathology examination requires time consuming scanning through tissue images under different magnification levels to find clinical assessment clues to produce correct diagnoses. Advances in digital imaging techniques offers assessment of pathology images using computer vision and machine learning methods which could automate some of the tasks in the diagnostic pathology workflow. Such automation could be beneficial to obtain fast and precise quantification, reduce observer variability, and increase objectivity. In this work, we propose to classify breast cancer histopathology images independent of their magnifications using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We propose two different architectures; single task CNN is used to predict malignancy and multi-task CNN is used to predict both malignancy and image magnification level simultaneously. Evaluations and comparisons with previous results are carried out on BreaKHis dataset. Experimental results show that our magnification independent CNN approach improved the performance of magnification specific model. Our results in this limited set of training data are comparable with previous state-of-the-art results obtained by hand-crafted features. However, unlike previous methods, our approach has potential to directly benefit from additional training data, and such additional data could be captured with same or different magnification levels than previous data.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900002","publicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7893644/7899596/07900002.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7899596","startPage":"2440","endPage":"2445","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep learning for magnification independent breast cancer histopathology image classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7900002","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Deep learning for magnification independent breast cancer histopathology image classification","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900002/","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16824576","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7900002/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep learning for magnification independent breast cancer histopathology image classification","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"0268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075007S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7893644","isNumber":"7899596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7893644","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"7899596","articleId":"7900002","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7900005,"authors":[{"name":"Kang-Hao Peng","affiliation":["Center for Automation Research, University of Maryland, Collage Park"],"lastName":"Kang-Hao Peng","id":"37088110910"},{"name":"Heng Zhang","affiliation":["Center for Automation Research, University of Maryland, Collage Park"],"lastName":"Heng Zhang","id":"37087530766"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4847-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4848-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7900005","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":247},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7900005","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Mutual information","Training","Manganese","Entropy","Annealing","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["classification tasks","pretraining algorithm","MI-RBM","mutual information-based RBM neural networks","concatenated restricted Boltzmann machines","infor- mation theory","deep-neural networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900005","pdfPath":"/iel7/7893644/7899596/07900005.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","startPage":"2458","endPage":"2463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7899596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900005","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mutual information-based RBM neural networks","abstract":"(Deep) neural networks are increasingly being used for various computer vision and pattern recognition tasks due to their strong ability to learn highly discriminative features.

However, the improved performance of additional layers in a deep network comes at the cost of added latency and energy usage in feedforward inference. As networks continue to get deeper and larger, these costs become more prohibitive for real-time and energy-sensitive applications. To address this issue, we present BranchyNet, a novel deep network architecture that is augmented with additional side branch classifiers. The architecture allows prediction results for a large portion of test samples to exit the network early via these branches when samples can already be inferred with high confidence. BranchyNet exploits the observation that features learned at an early layer of a network may often be sufficient for the classification of many data points. For more difficult samples, which are expected less frequently, BranchyNet will use further or all network layers to provide the best likelihood of correct prediction. We study the BranchyNet architecture using several well-known networks (LeNet, AlexNet, ResNet) and datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10) and show that it can both improve accuracy and significantly reduce the inference time of the network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900006/","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16824399","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7900006/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"BranchyNet: Fast inference via early exiting from deep neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BranchyNet: Fast inference via early exiting from deep neural networks","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"1347.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063522S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7893644","isNumber":"7899596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7893644","citationCount":"164","xplore-issue":"7899596","articleId":"7900006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7900011,"authors":[{"name":"David P.

While such model-free methods do achieve considerable performance, they often ignore the structure of task. We present a more natural representation of the solutions to Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems, within 3 Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) architectures to better exploit this inherent structure. The forward passes of each RCNN execute an efficient Value Iteration, propagate beliefs of state in partially observable environments, and choose optimal actions respectively. Applying back-propagation to these RCNNs allows the system to explicitly learn the Transition Model and Reward Function associated with the underlying MDP, serving as an elegant alternative to classical model-based RL. We evaluate the proposed algorithms in simulation, considering a robot planning problem. We demonstrate the capability of our framework to reduce the cost of re-planning, learn accurate MDP models, and finally re-plan with learned models to achieve near-optimal policies.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900026","startPage":"2592","endPage":"2597","publicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7899596","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7893644/7899596/07900026.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reinforcement Learning via Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900026/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Reinforcement Learning via Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7900026/","accessionNumber":"16835673","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reinforcement Learning via Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"1118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07635S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7893644","isNumber":"7899596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7893644","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7899596","articleId":"7900026","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7900030,"authors":[{"name":"Ba-Ngu Vo","affiliation":["Curtin University, Australia"],"firstName":"Ba-Ngu","lastName":"Vo","id":"37274760500"},{"name":"Nhat-Quang Tran","affiliation":["Curtin University, Australia"],"firstName":"Nhat-Quang","lastName":"Tran","id":"37086148453"},{"name":"Dinh Phung","affiliation":["Deakin University, Australia"],"firstName":"Dinh","lastName":"Phung","id":"37085377670"},{"name":"Ba-Tuong Vo","affiliation":["Curtin University, Australia"],"firstName":"Ba-Tuong","lastName":"Vo","id":"37289281300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4847-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4848-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7900030","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":186},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Data models","Maximum likelihood estimation","Measurement units","Computational modeling","Niobium","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","maximum likelihood estimation","pattern classification","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model-based classification","novelty detection","point pattern data","random finite sets","likelihood functions","maximum likelihood estimator","RFS models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Classification","novelty detection","naive Bayes model","point pattern data","multiple instance data","point process","random finite set"]}],"abstract":"Point patterns are sets or multi-sets of unordered elements that can be found in numerous data sources.

After the mapping relationship of these two features is trained, we can use phonetic discriminant features from source speaker to estimate target speaker's spectral features at conversion stage. The phonetic discriminant features are extracted using PCA from the output layer of a deep neural network (DNN) in an automatic speaker recognition (ASR) system. It can be seen as a low dimensional representation of the senone posteriors. We compare the proposed phonetically-aware method with conventional JD-GMM method on the Voice Conversion Challenge 2016 training database.

The objective is to introduce CTC framework on spotting process, and to enhance the system by WUW-oriented model training and refinement steps. We test the performance of the proposed architecture on a conversational telephone dataset which illustrate that the computation time can be significantly reduced without a significant decrease in the spotting accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900073","publicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7893644/7899596/07900073.pdf","startPage":"2878","endPage":"2883","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7899596","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7900073","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wake-up-word spotting using end-to-end deep neural network system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900073/","displayDocTitle":"Wake-up-word spotting using end-to-end deep neural network system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7900073/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16835631","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wake-up-word spotting using end-to-end deep neural network system","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"0267.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079321S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7893644","isNumber":"7899596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7893644","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7899596","articleId":"7900073","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7900075,"authors":[{"name":"Shilei Zhang","affiliation":["IBM Research - China, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Shilei Zhang","id":"37632415100"},{"name":"Yong Qin","affiliation":["IBM Research - China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Qin","id":"37633155000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4847-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4848-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7900075","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptation models","Hidden Markov models","Training","Acoustics","Data models","Transforms","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","feedforward neural nets","maximum likelihood estimation","regression analysis","speaker recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature space maximum likelihood linear regression","bilinear models feature","rapid speaker adaptation","utterance-level normalization","Mandarin short message dictation","voice query dataset","deep neural network acoustic modeling","FMLLR","DNN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep Neural Networks","rapid speaker adaptation","FMLLR","bilinear models"]}],"abstract":"Bilinear models based feature space Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression (FMLLR) speaker adaptation have showed good performance for GMM-HMMs especially when the amount of adaptation data is limited.

In order to address this problem, this article investigates acoustic modeling through Multi-Task Learning, with two speaker-related auxiliary tasks. Multi-Task Learning is a regularization method which aims at improving the network's generalization ability, by training a unique model to solve several different, but related tasks. In this article, two auxiliary tasks are jointly examined. On the one hand, we consider speaker classification as an auxiliary task by training the acoustic model to recognize the speaker, or find the closest one inside the training set. On the other hand, the acoustic model is also trained to extract i-vectors from the standard acoustic features. I-Vectors are efficiently applied in the speaker identification community in order to characterize a speaker and its acoustic environment. The core idea of using these auxiliary tasks is to give the network an additional inter-speaker awareness, and thus, reduce overfitting.We investigate this Multi-Task Learning setup on the TIMIT database, while the acoustic modeling is performed using a Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory cells.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7893644/7899596/07900077.pdf","startPage":"2900","endPage":"2905","publicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900077","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7899596","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7900077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speaker-aware Multi-Task Learning for automatic speech recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Acoustics","Feature extraction","Machine learning","Speech","Automatic speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","recurrent neural nets","speaker recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speaker-aware multitask learning","automatic speech recognition","acoustic modeling","speaker-related auxiliary tasks","regularization method","network generalization ability","speaker classification","speaker recognition","i-vector extraction","standard acoustic features","speaker identification","inter-speaker awareness","overfitting reduction","TIMIT database","recurrent neural network","long short-term memory cells"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Speaker-aware Multi-Task Learning for automatic speech recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7900077/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16824608","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speaker-aware Multi-Task Learning for automatic speech recognition","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"0881.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116941S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7893644","isNumber":"7899596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7893644","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7899596","articleId":"7900077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7900078,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Security, Nankai University, China"],"lastName":"Bo Zhang","id":"37537554300"},{"name":"Yuqin Gan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Security, Nankai University, China"],"lastName":"Yuqin Gan","id":"37086065251"},{"name":"Yan Song","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Security, Nankai University, China"],"lastName":"Yan Song","id":"37086061144"},{"name":"Benlai Tang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Security, Nankai University, China"],"lastName":"Benlai Tang","id":"37086060655"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4847-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4848-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7900078","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Neural networks","Dictionaries","Linear programming","Automata","Speech","Hidden Markov models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided instruction","neural nets","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pronunciation knowledge","phoneme recognition","LSTM neural network","connectionist temporal classification objective function","CTC objective function","speech corpora","network training","bidirectional long short-term memory network","LibriSpeech corpus"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["phoneme recognition","connectionist temporal classification","pronunciation knowledge"]}],"abstract":"When applied for phoneme recognition, the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) objective function allows a neural network to be trained with the phoneme level transcriptions of training utterances. A limitation of the CTC is that it can not be applied directly for network training with large speech corpora, since those corpora usually only have word level transcriptions. This work extends the CTC such that a novel objective function can be evaluated even if only the word level transcriptions are available. Furthermore, various pronunciation knowledge is adopted to construct pronunciation networks which can model the pronunciations of connected speech more accurately. When combined with a bidirectional Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) network, the extended CTC achieves a phoneme error rate of 18.3% on the LibriSpeech corpus. When various pronunciation knowledge is applied, the error rate is further reduced by 18.6% relatively.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900078","publicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7893644/7899596/07900078.pdf","startPage":"2906","endPage":"2911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7899596","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7900078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of pronunciation knowledge on phoneme recognition by LSTM neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900078/","displayDocTitle":"Application of pronunciation knowledge on phoneme recognition by LSTM neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7900078/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16824542","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of pronunciation knowledge on phoneme recognition by LSTM neural network","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"1700.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056809S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7893644","isNumber":"7899596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7893644","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7899596","articleId":"7900078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7900081,"authors":[{"name":"Chenyang Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, The City College of New York, New York, New York"],"lastName":"Chenyang Zhang","id":"38555594100"},{"name":"Yingli Tian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, The City College of New York, New York, New York"],"lastName":"Yingli Tian","id":"37069054600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4847-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4848-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7900081","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":466},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Encoding","Visualization","Logic gates","Decoding","History","Recurrent neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","feature extraction","feedforward neural nets","image colour analysis","image motion analysis","image representation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion history images","RGB frames","spatial feature extraction","temporal feature extraction","text descriptions","video representations","LSTM-based decoding language model","long-short-term-memory","3D convolutional neural networks","video encoding","parallel two-stream encoding component","combinational deep neural networks","joint two-stream encoding","automatic video description generation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7900081","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel two-stream framework based on combinational deep neural networks.

In previous research, we proposed a formulation of the problem to learn features from data (signature images) in a Writer-Independent format, using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), seeking to improve performance on the task.

We also present a visual analysis of the feature space learned by the model, and an analysis of the errors made by the classifier. Our analysis shows that the model is very effective in separating signatures that have a different global appearance, while being particularly vulnerable to forgeries that very closely resemble genuine signatures, even if their line quality is bad, which is the case of slowly-traced forgeries.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900092/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7900092/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16835940","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analyzing features learned for Offline Signature Verification using Deep CNNs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing features learned for Offline Signature Verification using Deep CNNs","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"0144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0898S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7893644","isNumber":"7899596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7893644","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7899596","articleId":"7900092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-02"},{"_id":7900104,"authors":[{"name":"Ester Gonzalez-Sosa","affiliation":["ATVS, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"],"firstName":"Ester","lastName":"Gonzalez-Sosa","id":"37085481893"},{"name":"Antitza Dantcheva","affiliation":["INRIA"],"firstName":"Antitza","lastName":"Dantcheva","id":"37595951400"},{"name":"Ruben Vera-Rodriguez","affiliation":["ATVS, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"],"firstName":"Ruben","lastName":"Vera-Rodriguez","id":"38284246400"},{"name":"Jean-Luc Dugelay","affiliation":["EURECOM"],"firstName":"Jean-Luc","lastName":"Dugelay","id":"37284270400"},{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois Br\u00e9mond","affiliation":["INRIA"],"firstName":"Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Br\u00e9mond","id":"37277573100"},{"name":"Julian Fierrez","affiliation":["ATVS, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"],"firstName":"Julian","lastName":"Fierrez","id":"37392738600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4847-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4848-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7900104","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":275},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7900104","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Estimation","Feature extraction","Databases","Histograms","Support vector machines","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image fusion","image texture","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image-based gender estimation","gender estimation algorithms","representative feature extraction","local binary patterns","LBP feature","scale-invariant feature transform","SIFT feature","body-based algorithm","body silhouettes","texture information","support vector machines","SVM","multibiometric tunnel database","body-based gender estimation","score-level-fusion schemes"]}],"abstract":"Gender estimation has received increased attention due to its use in a number of pertinent security and commercial applications. Automated gender estimation algorithms are mainly based on extracting representative features from face images. In this work we study gender estimation based on information deduced jointly from face and body, extracted from single-shot images. The approach addresses challenging settings such as low-resolution-images, as well as settings when faces are occluded. Specifically the face-based features include local binary patterns (LBP) and scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) features, projected into a PCA space. The features of the novel body-based algorithm proposed in this work include continuous shape information extracted from body silhouettes and texture information retained by HOG descriptors. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are used for classification for body and face features. We conduct experiments on images extracted from video-sequences of the Multi-Biometric Tunnel database, emphasizing on three distance-settings: close, medium and far, ranging from full body exposure (far setting) to head and shoulders exposure (close setting). The experiments suggest that while face-based gender estimation performs best in the close-distance-setting, body-based gender estimation performs best when a large part of the body is visible. Finally we present two score-level-fusion schemes of face and body-based features, outperforming the two individual modalities in most cases.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7899596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900104","endPage":"3066","publicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7893644/7899596/07900104.pdf","startPage":"3061","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image-based gender estimation from body and face across distances","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900104/","displayDocTitle":"Image-based gender estimation from body and face across distances","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16824582","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7900104/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image-based gender estimation from body and face across distances","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"1155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077526S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7893644","isNumber":"7899596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7893644","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7899596","articleId":"7900104","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7900108,"authors":[{"name":"Timothy Garrett","affiliation":["Virtual Reality Applications Center, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa, USA"],"firstName":"Timothy","lastName":"Garrett","id":"37086110396"},{"name":"Rafael Radkowski","affiliation":["Virtual Reality Applications Center, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa, USA"],"firstName":"Rafael","lastName":"Radkowski","id":"37267132900"},{"name":"Jeremy Sheaffer","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa, USA"],"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Sheaffer","id":"37394033800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4847-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4848-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7900108","dbTime":"39 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":283},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Graphics processing units","Feature extraction","Indexes","Sorting","Real-time systems","Instruction sets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["augmented reality","image registration","object tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPU-accelerated descriptor extraction process","3D registration problem","augmented reality","human-computer interaction","Microsoft Kinect","local registration methods","object-to-track","sampled object points","real-time descriptor computation"]}],"abstract":"Augmented Reality (AR) is a type of human-computer interaction that overlays virtual information on a user's natural visual perception of the environment. Determining where to place these virtual objects so they appear a part of the environment requires real-time tracking. One type of tracking uses point clouds, processed from commodity depth sensors, such as the Microsoft Kinect. In this format, tracking becomes a 3D registration problem which can be quickly solved using local registration methods; however, these techniques require a sufficient overlap between the object-to-track, and the sampled object points from the range camera. 3D descriptors can be used to provide this initial overlap, but require significant computational resources. This work extends previous research towards real-time descriptor computation on large point sets. To do so, the 3D descriptor extraction process is broken down into fundamental algorithmic steps. These steps are optimized by computing them on the GPU using NVIDIA's CUDA framework. Results of an experiment indicate the opportunity for large speed-ups in the most computationally intensive portions of descriptor extraction.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900108","publicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7893644/7899596/07900108.pdf","startPage":"3085","endPage":"3090","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7899596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU-accelerated descriptor extraction process for 3D registration in Augmented Reality","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7900108","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900108/","displayDocTitle":"GPU-accelerated descriptor extraction process for 3D registration in Augmented Reality","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16835617","htmlLink":"/document/7900108/","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU-accelerated descriptor extraction process for 3D registration in Augmented Reality","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"1352.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120472S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7893644","isNumber":"7899596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7893644","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7899596","articleId":"7900108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7900114,"authors":[{"name":"Andras Rozsa","affiliation":["University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, Vision and Security Technology (VAST) Lab"],"firstName":"Andras","lastName":"Rozsa","id":"37085689554"},{"name":"Manuel G\u00fcnther","affiliation":["University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, Vision and Security Technology (VAST) Lab"],"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"G\u00fcnther","id":"37086019583"},{"name":"Ethan M.

To be usable in stand-alone systems, facial attributes must be extracted from images automatically and reliably. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective solution for automatic facial attribute extraction by training a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for each facial attribute separately, without using any pre-training or dataset augmentation, and we obtain new state-of-the-art facial attribute classification results on the CelebA benchmark. To test the stability of the networks, we generated adversarial images - formed by adding imperceptible non-random perturbations to original inputs which result in classification errors - via a novel fast flipping attribute (FFA) technique. We show that FFA generates more adversarial examples than other related algorithms, and that DCNNs for certain attributes are generally robust to adversarial inputs, while DCNNs for other attributes are not. This result is surprising because no DCNNs tested to date have exhibited robustness to adversarial images without explicit augmentation in the training procedure to account for adversarial examples. Finally, we introduce the concept of natural adversarial samples, i.e., images that are misclassified but can be easily turned into correctly classified images by applying small perturbations. We demonstrate that natural adversarial samples commonly occur, even within the training set, and show that many of these images remain misclassified even with additional training epochs. This phenomenon is surprising because correcting the misclassification, particularly when guided by training data, should require only a small adjustment to the DCNN parameters.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900114","publicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7893644/7899596/07900114.pdf","startPage":"3121","endPage":"3127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7899596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Are facial attributes adversarially robust?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900114/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Are facial attributes adversarially robust?","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16824578","htmlLink":"/document/7900114/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Are facial attributes adversarially robust?","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"0512.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.151377S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7893644","isNumber":"7899596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7893644","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7899596","articleId":"7900114","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":7900116,"authors":[{"name":"Manish Chowdhury","affiliation":["KTH, School of Technology and Health, Huddinge, Sweden"],"firstName":"Manish","lastName":"Chowdhury","id":"37854777500"},{"name":"Samuel Rota Bul\u00f2","affiliation":["FBK-irst, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Samuel Rota","lastName":"Bul\u00f2","id":"37391883700"},{"name":"Rodrigo Moreno","affiliation":["KTH, School of Technology and Health, Huddinge, Sweden"],"firstName":"Rodrigo","lastName":"Moreno","id":"38029420500"},{"name":"Malay Kumar Kundu","affiliation":["Machine Intelligence Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Malay Kumar","lastName":"Kundu","id":"37269302300"},{"name":"\u00d6rjan Smedby","affiliation":["KTH, School of Technology and Health, Huddinge, Sweden"],"firstName":"\u00d6rjan","lastName":"Smedby","id":"38016529000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4847-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4848-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7900116","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":280},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Medical diagnostic imaging","Image edge detection","Image retrieval","Radiography","Histograms","Principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diagnostic radiography","image retrieval","medical image processing","neural nets","principal component analysis","query processing","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient radiographic image retrieval system","convolutional neural network","content-based medical image retrieval","CBMIR system","CNN","high-level image representations","nonparametric estimation","query image","edge histogram descriptor","principal component analysis","PCA","image retrieval-in-medical applications","medical data management","IRMA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7900116","abstract":"Content-Based Medical Image Retrieval (CBMIR) is an important research field in the context of medical data management.

The above issue has been addressed in two recent solutions, namely Deterministic Quantization (DQ) and Dynamic Temporal Quantization (DTQ). DQ divides the video into equal segments and extracts a visual feature vector for each segment. The bag-of-word feature is then encoded by hashing to facilitate approximate nearest neighbor search using Hamming distance. One weakness of this approach is the deterministic segmentation of video data. DTQ improves on this by using dynamic video segmentation to obtain varied-length video segments. As a result, feature vectors extracted from these video segments can better capture the semantic content of the video. To support very large video databases, it is desirable to minimize the number of segments in order to keep the size of the feature representation as small as possible. We achieve this by using only one video segment (i.e., no video data segmentation is even necessary) with even better retrieval performance. Our scheme models video using differential long short-term memory (DLSTM) recurrent neural networks and obtains a highly compact fixed-size feature representation with the output of hidden states of the DLSTM. Each of these features are further compressed by hashing them into binary bits via quantization. Experimental results based on two public data sets, UCF101 and MSRActionPairs, indicate that the proposed video modeling technique outperforms DTQ by a significant margin.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900131","startPage":"3222","endPage":"3227","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7893644/7899596/07900131.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7899596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DLSTM approach to video modeling with hashing for large-scale video retrieval","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Quantization (signal)","Computational modeling","Data models","Semantics","Speech recognition","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video retrieval","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DLSTM approach","large-scale video retrieval","Euclidean distance","video segment","differential long short-term memory","DLSTM recurrent neural networks","fixed-size feature representation","UCF101","MSRActionPairs","video modeling technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900131/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"DLSTM approach to video modeling with hashing for large-scale video retrieval","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7900131/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16835608","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DLSTM approach to video modeling with hashing for large-scale video retrieval","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"0405.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099288S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7893644","isNumber":"7899596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7893644","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7899596","articleId":"7900131","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7900133,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Liu","affiliation":["LTCI, Telecom-ParisTech, Paris, France"],"lastName":"Gang Liu","id":"37087072749"},{"name":"Yann Gousseau","affiliation":["LTCI, Telecom-ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Yann","lastName":"Gousseau","id":"37586359600"},{"name":"Gui-Song Xia","affiliation":["State Key Lab.

In contrast with existing methods, the presented method inherits from previous CNN approaches the ability to depict local structures and fine scale details, and at the same time yields coherent large scale structures, even in the case of quasi-periodic images.

For object recognition, CNNs might be limited by its strict label requirement and an implicit assumption that images are supposed to be target-object-dominated for optimal solutions. However, the labeling procedure, necessitating laying out the locations of target objects, is very tedious, making high-quality large-scale dataset prohibitively expensive. Data augmentation schemes are widely used when deep networks suffer the insufficient training data problem. All the images produced through data augmentation share the same label, which may be problematic since not all data augmentation methods are label-preserving. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised CNN framework named Multiple Instance Learning Convolutional Neural Networks (MILCNN) to solve this problem. We apply MILCNN framework to object recognition and report state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ILSVRC2015 classification dataset.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900139","publicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7893644/7899596/07900139.pdf","startPage":"3270","endPage":"3275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7899596","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7900139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple Instance Learning Convolutional Neural Networks for object recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900139/","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Instance Learning Convolutional Neural Networks for object recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7900139/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16824557","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Instance Learning Convolutional Neural Networks for object recognition","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"0813.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074181S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7893644","isNumber":"7899596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7893644","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7899596","articleId":"7900139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":7900141,"authors":[{"name":"Linnan Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, China"],"lastName":"Linnan Zhu","id":"37087760639"},{"name":"Keze Wang","affiliation":["Sun Yat-sen University, China","Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, China"],"lastName":"Keze Wang","id":"37087760370"},{"name":"Liang Lin","affiliation":["Sun Yat-sen University, China"],"lastName":"Liang Lin","id":"37087433206"},{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, China"],"lastName":"Lei Zhang","id":"37087164989"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4847-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4848-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7900141","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":334},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Image recognition","Face recognition","Feature extraction","Network architecture","Convolution","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","gender issues","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lightweight deep convolutional network","gender recognition","joint age recognition","lightweight deep model","face image","network architecture","joint regression model","multitask learning scheme","shared features","competitive recognition accuracy"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7900141","abstract":"This paper proposes a lightweight deep model to recognize age and gender from a face image.

A COSFIRE filter is selective for a collection of contour parts in a certain spatial arrangement. These contour parts and their spatial arrangement are determined in an automatic configuration procedure from a single user-specified pattern of interest. The traditional configuration, however, does not guarantee the selection of the most distinctive contour parts. We propose a genetic algorithm-based optimization step in the configuration of COSFIRE filters that determines the minimum subset of contour parts that best characterize the pattern of interest. We use a public dataset of images of an edge milling head machine equipped with multiple cutting tools to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization step for the detection and localization of such tools. The optimization process that we propose yields COSFIRE filters with substantially higher generalization capability. With an average of only six COSFIRE filters we achieve high precision P and recall R rates (P = 91.99%; R = 96.22%). This outperforms the original COSFIRE filter approach (without optimization) mostly in terms of recall. The proposed optimization procedure increases the efficiency of COSFIRE filters with little effect on the selectivity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900152/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7900152/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16835907","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Increased generalization capability of trainable COSFIRE filters with application to machine vision","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Increased generalization capability of trainable COSFIRE filters with application to machine vision","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"1306.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061931S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7893644","isNumber":"7899596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7893644","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7899596","articleId":"7900152","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7900159,"authors":[{"name":"Siqi Wang","affiliation":["College of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"lastName":"Siqi Wang","id":"37085904853"},{"name":"En Zhu","affiliation":["College of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"lastName":"En Zhu","id":"37086043959"},{"name":"Jianping Yin","affiliation":["College of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"lastName":"Jianping Yin","id":"37289417600"},{"name":"Fatih Porikli","affiliation":["College of Engineering and Computer Science, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia"],"firstName":"Fatih","lastName":"Porikli","id":"37283409500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4847-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4848-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7900159","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":359},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Histograms","Legged locomotion","Three-dimensional displays","Feature extraction","Testing","Robustness","Principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","image classification","image sequences","principal component analysis","video cameras","video signal processing","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crowded scenes","SL-HOF descriptor","foreground classification","surveillance cameras","massive video data analysis","spatially localized histogram of optical flow descriptor","spatial distribution","robust PCA","one-class SVM","OCSVM","UCSD datasets","video anomaly detection methods"]}],"abstract":"With the widespread use of surveillance cameras, massive video data analysis has become an extremely labor-intensive work. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach to detect video anomaly in crowded scenes based on Spatially Localized Histogram of Optical Flow (SL-HOF) descriptor and foreground classification. For motion description, the new SL-HOF descriptor can not only preserve classic HOF descriptor's favorable capability of characterizing the motion velocity and direction of foreground in crowded scene, but also depicts the spatial distribution of optical flow, which implicitly encodes the structure and local motion information of foreground objects in videos. SL-HOF is shown to significantly outperform other classic video descriptors. To further boost the performance of anomaly localization, we then introduce Robust PCA based foreground classification to discriminate anomalous foreground texture.

In this article we propose a lexicon-free decoding, combined with a lexicon verification method. This lexicon control method presents some interesting properties and enables us to efficiently combine LSTM networks in a cascade framework. This cascade process is not driven but simply controlled by the lexicon, allowing it to speed up the decoding while being nearly insensitive to the lexicon size. Our approach presents promising results with low error rate by conceding rejects. Those rejects can finally be processed by a standard lexical decoding, enabling us to reach state of the art performance, while being much faster than existing methods for decoding.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900162","pdfPath":"/iel7/7893644/7899596/07900162.pdf","startPage":"3416","endPage":"3421","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","publicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7899596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cascading BLSTM networks for handwritten word recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900162/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Cascading BLSTM networks for handwritten word recognition","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","accessionNumber":"16835911","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7900162/","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cascading BLSTM networks for handwritten word recognition","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"0655.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098772S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7893644","isNumber":"7899596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7893644","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7899596","articleId":"7900162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7900164,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Du","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, P.

In general approaches using monocular cameras, the upper and lower positions of each pedestrian are detected using a bounding box obtained from a pedestrian detection technique. The distance between the pedestrian and the vehicle is then estimated using these positions and the camera parameters. This conventional framework uses independent pedestrian detection and position detection processes to estimate the distance. In this paper, we propose a method to detect both the pedestrian and their position simultaneously using a regression-based deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). This simultaneous detection method is possible to train efficient features for both tasks, because it is attention to head and leg regions from given labels. In the experiments, our method improves the performance of pedestrian detection compared with the DCNN which detects only pedestrian. The proposed approach also improves the detection accuracy of the head and leg positions compared with the methods that detect only these positions. Using the results of position detection and the camera parameters, our method achieves distance estimation to within 5% error.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900176","pdfPath":"/iel7/7893644/7899596/07900176.pdf","startPage":"3500","endPage":"3505","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","publicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7899596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pedestrian and part position detection using a regression-based multiple task deep convolutional neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900176/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Pedestrian and part position detection using a regression-based multiple task deep convolutional neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","accessionNumber":"16824551","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7900176/","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pedestrian and part position detection using a regression-based multiple task deep convolutional neural network","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"1012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047443S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7893644","isNumber":"7899596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7893644","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7899596","articleId":"7900176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7900177,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Xu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085990831"},{"name":"Sinisa Todorovic","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon"],"firstName":"Sinisa","lastName":"Todorovic","id":"37274121600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4847-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4848-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7900177","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":296},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7900177","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Shape","Solid modeling","Computer architecture","Training","Knowledge transfer","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep convolutional neural network","beam search","3D shape recognition","3D voxels","uniform 3D grid","robust learning","CNN learning","optimal CNN architecture","computer vision","hand-tuning strategies","3D ModelNet dataset","3D shape classification"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses 3D shape recognition. Recent work typically represents a 3D shape as a set of binary variables corresponding to 3D voxels of a uniform 3D grid centered on the shape, and resorts to deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for modeling these binary variables. Robust learning of such CNNs is currently limited by the small datasets of 3D shapes available - an order of magnitude smaller than other common datasets in computer vision. Related work typically deals with the small training datasets using a number of ad hoc, hand-tuning strategies. To address this issue, we formulate CNN learning as a beam search aimed at identifying an optimal CNN architecture - namely, the number of layers, nodes, and their connectivity in the network - as well as estimating parameters of such an optimal CNN. Each state of the beam search corresponds to a candidate CNN. Two types of actions are defined to add new convolutional filters or new convolutional layers to a parent CNN, and thus transition to children states. The utility function of each action is efficiently computed by transferring parameter values of the parent CNN to its children, thereby enabling an efficient beam search. Our experimental evaluation on the 3D ModelNet dataset demonstrates that our model pursuit using the beam search yields a CNN with superior performance on 3D shape classification than the state of the art.","publicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7893644/7899596/07900177.pdf","startPage":"3506","endPage":"3511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900177","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7899596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beam search for learning a deep Convolutional Neural Network of 3D shapes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Beam search for learning a deep Convolutional Neural Network of 3D shapes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900177/","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7900177/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16824476","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beam search for learning a deep Convolutional Neural Network of 3D shapes","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"1655.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05189S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7893644","isNumber":"7899596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7893644","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7899596","articleId":"7900177","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7900179,"authors":[{"name":"Philippe Burlina","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, Johns Hopkins University"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Burlina","id":"37344557800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4847-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4848-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7900179","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":816},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MRCNN: A stateful Fast R-CNN","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7893644/7899596/07900179.pdf","startPage":"3518","endPage":"3523","publicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7899596","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900179","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proposals","Filtering","Bayes methods","Object detection","Graphics processing units","Target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","image classification","image filtering","neural nets","object detection","object tracking","recursive filters","regression analysis","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MRCNN","stateful fast R-CNN","deep convolutional neural networks","image classification","object detection","region CNNs","resource-limited systems","location regression","recursive Bayesian filtering","multitarget proposal-detection tracking","MTT","detection-to-track association"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Region CNNs in Video","Deep Learning","ConvNets","Region Proposals","Fast R-CNN"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7900179","abstract":"Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) perform on par or better than humans for image classification. Hence efforts have now shifted to more challenging tasks such as object detection and classification in images, video or RGBD. Recently developed region CNNs (R-CNN) such as Fast R-CNN [7] address this detection task for images. Instead, this paper is concerned with video and also focuses on resource-limited systems. Newly proposed methods accelerate R-CNN by sharing convolutional layers for proposal generation, location regression and labeling [12][13][19][25]. These approaches when applied to video are stateless: they process each image individually. This suggests an alternate route: to make R-CNN stateful and exploit temporal consistency. We extend Fast R-CNNs by making it employ recursive Bayesian filtering and perform proposal propagation and reuse. We couple multi-target proposal/detection tracking (MTT) with R-CNN and do detection-to-track association. We call this approach MRCNN as short for MTT + R-CNN. In MRCNN, region proposals that are vetted via classification and regression in R-CNNs - are treated as observations in MTT and propagated using assumed kinematics. Actual proposal generation (e.g. via Selective Search) need only be performed sporadically and/or periodically and is replaced at all other times by MTT proposal predictions. Preliminary results show that MRCNNs can economize on both proposal and classification computations, and can yield up to a 10 to 30 factor decrease in number of proposals generated, about one order of magnitude proposal computation time savings and nearly one order magnitude improvement in overall computational time savings, for comparable localization and classification performance. This method can additionally be beneficial for false alarm abatement.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900179/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16835738","htmlLink":"/document/7900179/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"MRCNN: A stateful Fast R-CNN","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MRCNN: A stateful Fast R-CNN","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"0294.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057985S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7893644","isNumber":"7899596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7893644","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7899596","articleId":"7900179","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":7900180,"authors":[{"name":"Zhigang Tu","affiliation":["School of Computing Informatics, Decision System Engineering Arizona State University Tempe, USA"],"firstName":"Zhigang","lastName":"Tu","id":"37086083137"},{"name":"Jun Cao","affiliation":["Intel Corp., Tempe, USA"],"lastName":"Jun Cao","id":"37087173521"},{"name":"Yikang Li","affiliation":["School of Computing Informatics, Decision System Engineering Arizona State University Tempe, USA"],"lastName":"Yikang Li","id":"37087606024"},{"name":"Baoxin Li","affiliation":["School of Computing Informatics, Decision System Engineering Arizona State University Tempe, USA"],"firstName":"Baoxin","lastName":"Li","id":"37292487900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4847-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4848-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7900180","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":349},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Tracking","Optical imaging","Sparse matrices","Trajectory","Pattern recognition","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","feedforward neural nets","image colour analysis","image motion analysis","image representation","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["action recognition","convolutional neural networks","video representation","motion-salient region","action labeling","foreground detection technique","region of interest","ROI","appearance features","motion features","RGB image","CNN feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Action recognition","Motion salient regions","Convolutional Neural Networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7900180","abstract":"In recent years the most popular video-based human action recognition methods rely on extracting feature representations using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and then using these representations to classify actions. In this work, we propose a fast and accurate video representation that is derived from the motion-salient region (MSR), which represents features most useful for action labeling. By improving a well-performed foreground detection technique, the region of interest (ROI) corresponding to actors in the foreground in both the appearance and the motion field can be detected under various realistic challenges. Furthermore, we propose a complementary motion salient measure to select a secondary ROI - the major moving part of the human. Accordingly, a MSR-based CNN descriptor (MSR-CNN) is formulated to recognize human action, where the descriptor incorporates appearance and motion features along with tracks of MSR. The computation can be efficiently implemented due to two characteristics: 1) only part of the RGB image and the motion field need to be processed; 2) less data is used as input for the CNN feature extraction. Comparative evaluation on JHMDB and UCF Sports datasets shows that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in both efficiency and accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900180","startPage":"3524","endPage":"3529","publicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7899596","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7893644/7899596/07900180.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MSR-CNN: Applying motion salient region based descriptors for action recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900180/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"MSR-CNN: Applying motion salient region based descriptors for action recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7900180/","accessionNumber":"16835837","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MSR-CNN: Applying motion salient region based descriptors for action recognition","confLoc":"Cancun","sourcePdf":"0757.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067426S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7893644","isNumber":"7899596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7893644","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7899596","articleId":"7900180","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7900181,"authors":[{"name":"Luis Tob\u00edas","affiliation":["Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com, T\u00e9l\u00e9com-Bretagne; UMR 6285 LabSTICC, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Tob\u00edas","id":"37086066165"},{"name":"Aur\u00e9lien Ducournau","affiliation":["Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com, T\u00e9l\u00e9com-Bretagne; UMR 6285 LabSTICC, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Aur\u00e9lien","lastName":"Ducournau","id":"37594398400"},{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois Rousseau","affiliation":["T\u00e9l\u00e9com-Bretagne; UMR1101LATIM, Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Rousseau","id":"37085735134"},{"name":"Gr\u00e9goire Mercier","affiliation":["Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com, T\u00e9l\u00e9com-Bretagne; UMR 6285 LabSTICC, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Gr\u00e9goire","lastName":"Mercier","id":"37269694700"},{"name":"Ronan Fablet","affiliation":["Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com, T\u00e9l\u00e9com-Bretagne; UMR 6285 LabSTICC, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Ronan","lastName":"Fablet","id":"37271896000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4847-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4848-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7900181","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1062},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile handsets","Computer architecture","Training","Kernel","Computational modeling","Feature extraction","Biological neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile computing","neural nets","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural networks","mobile devices","deep learning","pattern recognition","general purpose graphic processor units","GPGPU","lightweight CNN schemes","domain-specific object recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Machine Learning","Deep Learning","Convolutional Neural Networks","Object Detection","Mobile Devices"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7900181","abstract":"Deep Learning (DL), especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), has become the state-of-the-art for a variety of pattern recognition issues.

Overcoming these challenges, Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) can learn specific and adaptable features depending on the data while, at the same time, learn classifiers. In this work, we propose a novel technique to automatically perform pixel-wise land cover classification. To the best of our knowledge, there is no other work in the literature that perform pixel-wise semantic segmentation based on data-driven feature descriptors for high-resolution remote sensing images. The main idea is to exploit the power of ConvNet feature representations to learn how to semantically segment remote sensing images. First, our method learns each label in a pixel-wise manner by taking into account the spatial context of each pixel. In a predicting phase, the probability of a pixel belonging to a class is also estimated according to its spatial context and the learned patterns. We conducted a systematic evaluation of the proposed algorithm using two remote sensing datasets with very distinct properties. Our results show that the proposed algorithm provides improvements when compared to traditional and state-of-the-art methods that ranges from 5 to 15% in terms of accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900187/","accessionNumber":"16824518","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7900187/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Learning to semantically segment high-resolution remote sensing images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to semantically segment high-resolution remote sensing images","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"1495.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083962S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7893644","isNumber":"7899596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7893644","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7899596","articleId":"7900187","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7900188,"authors":[{"name":"Maya Kabkab","affiliation":["UMIACS, Center for Automation Research","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park"],"firstName":"Maya","lastName":"Kabkab","id":"37086040492"},{"name":"Emily Hand","affiliation":["UMIACS, Center for Automation Research"],"firstName":"Emily","lastName":"Hand","id":"38467007900"},{"name":"Rama Chellappa","affiliation":["UMIACS, Center for Automation Research","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park"],"firstName":"Rama","lastName":"Chellappa","id":"37274537000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4847-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4848-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7900188","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":334},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7900188","abstract":"While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently achieved impressive results on many classification tasks, it is still unclear why they perform so well and how to properly design them.

In that field, structural similarity (SSIM) index has been shown to favorably agree with human perceptual assessment, significantly outperforming the method of mean squared error, i.e., L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n distance. The similarity measure function in SSIM which compares a target (distorted) image with its reference (original) image is handcrafted in a simple form via a top-down approach based on the human visual system. It, however, might lack optimality without directly considering the relationships between image data and the perceptual assessment (scores). In this paper, we propose a method to construct an image similarity measure based on actual data. The proposed method optimizes a similarity measure function by exploiting annotated data in a bottom-up and data-driven manner, while retaining the favorable property of structural similarity in SSIM. The non-linear similarity function is optimized as the global optimum of high generalization power. In addition, the proposed method is simply formulated and thus applicable to the family of SSIM, especially to FSIM which has been recently proposed exhibiting superior performance to SSIM. The experimental results on image quality assessment demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to the other methods.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7899596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900206","publicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7893644/7899596/07900206.pdf","startPage":"3679","endPage":"3684","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning data-driven image similarity measure","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Learning data-driven image similarity measure","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7900206/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16824471","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900206/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning data-driven image similarity measure","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"0560.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082731S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7893644","isNumber":"7899596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7893644","xplore-issue":"7899596","articleId":"7900206","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7900208,"authors":[{"name":"Domonkos Varga","affiliation":["MTA SZTAKI, Institute for Computer Science and Control","Department of Networked Systems and Services, Budapest University of Technology"],"firstName":"Domonkos","lastName":"Varga","id":"37073072800"},{"name":"Tam\u00e1s Szir\u00e1nyi","affiliation":["MTA SZTAKI, Institute for Computer Science and Control","Department of Material Handling and Logistics Systems, Budapest University of Technology"],"firstName":"Tam\u00e1s","lastName":"Szir\u00e1nyi","id":"37268922300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4847-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4848-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7900208","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1016},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Semantics","Feature extraction","Gray-scale","Neural networks","Databases","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","image colour analysis","learning (artificial intelligence)","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fully automatic image colorization","deep learning","input grayscale image colorization","image processing","feedforward two-stage architecture","convolutional neural network","V color channels","U color channels","high-quality image colorization","SUN database","quaternion structural similarity","QSSIM","colorization quality","index-number"]}],"abstract":"This paper deals with automatic image colorization.

The state-of-the-art downsampling method is constructed upon the maximum spanning trees of the graphs. However, under the framework of this method, unbalanced downsampling often occurs for signals defined on densely connected unweighted graphs, such as social network data. The unbalance also significantly reduces the maximal downsampling level, making it smaller than the level we expect. In applications, the maximal level must be estimated to ensure that it is larger than the expected level; meanwhile, the unbalance has to be reduced, if it occurs. In this paper, we propose a novel method to jointly estimate the maximal level and reduce the downsampling unbalance.

However, to make this data easily accessible the scanned documents need to be transformed into search-able text. State of the art OCR systems using Long-Short-Term-Memory networks (LSTM) have been applied successfully to recognize text in both printed and handwritten form. Besides the general challenges with historical documents, e.g. poor image quality, damaged characters, etc., especially unknown scripts and old fonds make it difficult to provide the large amount of transcribed training data required for these methods to perform well. Transcribing the documents manually is very costly in terms of man-hours and require language specific expertise. The unknown fonds and requirement for meaningful context also make the use of synthetic data unfeasible. We therefore propose an end-to-end framework anyOCR that cuts the required input from language experts to a minimum and is therefore easily extendable to other documents. Our approach combines the strengths of segmentation-based OCR methods utilizing clustering on individual characters and segmentation-free OCR methods utilizing a LSTM architecture.

The proposed controller is derived by effectively integrating adaptive control with extended state observer via backstepping method. The adaptive law is synthesized to handle parametric uncertainties and the remaining uncertainties are estimated by the extended state observer and then compensated in a feedforward way. The unique features of the proposed controller are that not only the matched uncertainties but also unmatched uncertainties are estimated by constructing two extended state observers, and the parameter adaptation law is driven by both tracking errors and state estimation errors. Since the majority of parametric uncertainties can be reduced by the parameter adaptation, the task of the extended state observer is much alleviated. Consequently, high-gain feedback is avoided and improved tracking performance can be expected. The proposed controller theoretically achieves an asymptotic tracking performance in the presence of parametric uncertainties and constant disturbances. In addition, prescribed transient tracking performance and final tracking accuracy can also be guaranteed when existing time-variant uncertain nonlinearities. Comparative experimental results are obtained to verify the high tracking performance nature of the proposed control strategy.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial

However, when one working barrier is being replaced by another, if any intruder comes into the potential-breach-point between these two barriers, the barrier-breach problem may occur. In this letter, the proposed algorithm uses mobile elements to check presence of intruders at potential-breach-points. Compared with the extant algorithms, the proposed algorithm has two major advantages. First, it does not remove crossing barriers, so the overall network lifetime of barrier coverage can be extended. Second, it does not alternate working barriers always based on the order of barrier's distance to the front side, from near to far, so the sleep-wakeup schedule can be flexibly arranged.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2694432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8063256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2694432","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8063256/07900327.pdf","startPage":"2262","endPage":"2265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Barrier-Breach Problem of Barrier Coverage in Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"The Barrier-Breach Problem of Barrier Coverage in Wireless Sensor Networks","volume":"21","issue":"10","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7900327/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17216569","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900327/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST105-2221-E-032-047"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Barrier-Breach Problem of Barrier Coverage in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"lcomm-cheng-2694432-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046287S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8063256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8063256","articleId":"7900327","onlineDate":"14 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7900335,"authors":[{"name":"Daiming Qu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7973115/7900335/qu-2693277-small.gif","p":["Daiming Qu received the Ph.D. degree in information and communication engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2003.

We propose a novel method for shortening these tails. By appending a set of virtual (i.e., none data carrying) symbols to the beginning and the end of each packet, and clever selection of these symbols, we show that the ramp-up and ramp-down tails in the FBMC-OQAM can be suppressed to the extent that they are deemed negligible and thus may be ignored. This shortens the length of signal burst in each FBMC-OQAM packet and improves its spectral efficiency, viz., the same data is transmitted over a shorter period of time. We develop an optimization method that allows computation of virtual symbols for each data packet. Simulation results show that, compared with the existing methods, the proposed tail-shortening approach leads to superior out-of-band emissions performance and a much lower error vector magnitude for the demodulated symbols.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2693277","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7973115/07900335.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2693277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7973115","startPage":"4204","endPage":"4215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Spectral Efficiency of FBMC-OQAM Through Virtual Symbols","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7900335","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improving Spectral Efficiency of FBMC-OQAM Through Virtual Symbols","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900335/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17026584","dateOfInsertion":"11 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7900335/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571200 and 61325004"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008081","fundingName":"Open Research Fund of the National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory of Southeast University","grantNumber":"2014D09"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Development 863 Program of China","grantNumber":"2015AA01A710 and 2014AA01A704"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Spectral Efficiency of FBMC-OQAM Through Virtual Symbols","sourcePdf":"twc-qu-2693277-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121377S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7973115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7973115","articleId":"7900335","onlineDate":"14 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7900337,"authors":[{"name":"Shikhar Verma","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/8013866/7900337/verma-2694469-small.gif","p":["Shikhar Verma (S\u201915) received the bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science and engineering from the National Institute of Science and Technology, Berhampur, India, in 2014.

Real-time analytics on the massive IoT data, referred to as the \u201creal-time IoT analytics\u201d in this paper, is becoming the mainstream with an aim to provide an immediate or non-immediate actionable insights and business intelligence. However, the analytics network of the existing IoT systems does not adequately consider the requirements of the real-time IoT analytics. In fact, most researchers overlooked an appropriate design of the IoT analytics network while focusing much on the sensing and delivery networks of the IoT system. Since much of the IoT analytics network has often been taken as granted, the survey, in this paper, we aim to review the state-of-theart of the analytics network methodologies, which are suitable for real-time IoT analytics. In this vein, we first describe the basics of the real-time IoT analytics, use cases, and software platforms, and then explain the shortcomings of the network methodologies to support them. To address those shortcomings, we then discuss the relevant network methodologies which may support the real-time IoT analytics. Also, we present a number of prospective research problems and future research directions focusing on the network methodologies for the real-time IoT analytics.","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2017.2694469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2017.2694469","startPage":"1457","endPage":"1477","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/8013866/07900337.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8013866","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey on Network Methodologies for Real-Time Analytics of Massive IoT Data and Open Research Issues","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900337/","chronOrPublicationDate":"thirdquarter  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Survey on Network Methodologies for Real-Time Analytics of Massive IoT Data and Open Research Issues","volume":"19","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2017","accessionNumber":"17136510","publicationDate":"thirdquarter 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7900337/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002241","fundingName":"Strategic International Research Cooperative Program, Japan Science and Technology Agency"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey on Network Methodologies for Real-Time Analytics of Massive IoT Data and Open Research Issues","sourcePdf":"comst-verma-2694469-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.321785S","chronDate":"thirdquarter  2017","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"8013866","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"8013866","articleId":"7900337","onlineDate":"14 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7900339,"authors":[{"name":"Ji-Hoon Suh","affiliation":["Mobile Sensor and IT Convergence Center and the School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ji-Hoon","lastName":"Suh","orcid":"0000-0002-3410-8736","id":"37085506045"},{"name":"Jeong-Ho Park","affiliation":["Mobile Sensor and IT Convergence Center and the School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jeong-Ho","lastName":"Park","id":"38184550300"},{"name":"Soon-Jae Kweon","affiliation":["Mobile Sensor and IT Convergence Center and the School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Soon-Jae","lastName":"Kweon","id":"37085536677"},{"name":"Hyung-Joun Yoo","affiliation":["Mobile Sensor and IT Convergence Center and the School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyung-Joun","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37289039500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7900339","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":685},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7900339","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Switches","Switching circuits","Interpolation","Linearity","Temperature sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","CMOS integrated circuits","low-power electronics","sensors","switched capacitor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiparameter sensor interface circuit","integrative baseline/offset compensation","multiparameter sensing microsystems","voltage type sensors","switched-capacitor-based circuits","integrative signal conditioning","sensor signals","voltage signals","rail-to-rail baseline compensation","fine offset cancellation","switched-capacitor level shifting/balancing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplifier balancing","baseline cancellation","interpolation DAC","microsystem","multiparameter sensor interface","offset cancellation","switched-capacitor level-shifter"]}],"abstract":"The proposed sensor interface circuit provides an integrative baseline/offset compensation to give higher adaptability and effectiveness for multiparameter sensing microsystems.

Latent factor (LF)-based QoS-predictors have proven to be effective in dealing with it. However, they are based on first-order solvers that cannot well address their target problem that is inherently bilinear and nonconvex, thereby leaving a significant opportunity for accuracy improvement. This paper proposes to incorporate an efficient second-order solver into them to raise their accuracy. To do so, we adopt the principle of Hessian-free optimization and successfully avoid the direct manipulation of a Hessian matrix, by employing the efficiently obtainable product between its Gauss-Newton approximation and an arbitrary vector. Thus, the second-order information is innovatively integrated into them. Experimental results on two industrial QoS datasets indicate that compared with the state-of-the-art predictors, the newly proposed one achieves significantly higher prediction accuracy at the expense of affordable computational burden. Hence, it is especially suitable for industrial applications requiring high prediction accuracy of unknown QoS data.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2017.2685521","startPage":"1216","endPage":"1228","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/8310719/07900340.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2017.2685521","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8310719","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incorporation of Efficient Second-Order Solvers Into Latent Factor Models for Accurate Prediction of Missing QoS Data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Predictive models","Optimization","Computational modeling","Mathematical model","Data models","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","data handling","Hessian matrices","manufacturing data processing","Newton method","optimisation","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gauss-Newton approximation","second-order information","industrial QoS datasets","high prediction accuracy","unknown QoS data","second-order solver","latent factor models","missing QoS data","quality-of-service data","QoS-predictors","first-order solvers","Hessian-free optimization","Hessian matrix","industrial applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Big data","latent factor model","missing data prediction","quality-of-service (QoS)","second-order solver","service computing sparse matrices","Web service"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900340/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","displayDocTitle":"Incorporation of Efficient Second-Order Solvers Into Latent Factor Models for Accurate Prediction of Missing QoS Data","volume":"48","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7900340/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2018","accessionNumber":"17616660","pubMedId":"28422674","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002367","fundingName":"Pioneer Hundred Talents Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"fundingName":"International Joint Project through the Royal Society of the U.K. and the National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61611130209"},{"fundingName":"Young Scientist Foundation of Chongqing","grantNumber":"cstc2014kjrc-qnrc40005"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61370150, 61433014 and 61402198"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"106112016CDJXY180005 and CDJZR12180012"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incorporation of Efficient Second-Order Solvers Into Latent Factor Models for Accurate Prediction of Missing QoS Data","sourcePdf":"tcyb-zhou-2685521-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129054S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"8310719","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"8310719","articleId":"7900340","onlineDate":"14 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7900350,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Long Chin","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7900350/chin-2694449-small.gif","p":["Wen-Long Chin received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1994, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1996, and the Ph.D. degree in electronics engineering from NCTU, in 2008.

Since there are many unknown parameters in the Neyman-Pearson detector to be resolved, we also present a generalized log-likelihood ratio test (GLRT) spectrum sensor. The considered problem is complex and leads to a joint detection and estimation problem. The proposed GLRT spectrum sensor only needs received samples.

Therefore, monitoring the journal-bearing condition in the field relies mainly on the analysis of proximity-probe or accelerometer signals. However, not all motors with journal bearings are equipped with such mechanical sensors due to cost or environmental restrictions. In this article, we evaluate the feasibility of applying motor current signature analysis (MCSA) for the remote monitoring of mechanical instabilities in journal bearings produced by oil-whirl and bearing-clearance problems. In addition, we present a small-scale journal-bearing test setup that can be implemented in low-voltage motors for testing journal-bearing faults under controlled conditions. An experimental study on a sealless fuel-pump motor operating in the field and on the custom-built journal-bearing motor test setup shows that MCSA can remotely monitor journal-bearing oil whirl and excessive clearance to prevent motor failure. The results of vibration analysis are also presented for comparative evaluation.","doi":"10.1109/MIAS.2016.2600725","publicationTitle":"IEEE Industry Applications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Industry Applications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/2943/7944532/07900355.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7944532","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIAS.2016.2600725","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monitoring Journal-Bearing Faults: Making Use of Motor Current Signature Analysis for Induction Motors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7900355","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Monitoring Journal-Bearing Faults: Making Use of Motor Current Signature Analysis for Induction Motors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900355/","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"08 June 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16948231","htmlLink":"/document/7900355/","volume":"23","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monitoring Journal-Bearing Faults: Making Use of Motor Current Signature Analysis for Induction Motors","sourcePdf":"23mias04-jung-2600725-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070527S","chronDate":"July-Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"2943","isNumber":"7944532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2943","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7944532","articleId":"7900355","onlineDate":"14 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7900356,"authors":[{"name":"Ran Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE), Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7900356/zhang-2693299-small.gif","p":["Ran Zhang received the B.Eng. degree in communication engineering from Jilin University, China, in 2014.

Specifically, we derive a close-form expression to determine the receiver's position and orientation using the singular value decomposition (SVD) technique, which speeds up the positioning process and enhances the robustness. Simulation results show that the proposed SVD-based noniterative positioning algorithm is 50-80 times faster than the conventional iterative Levenberg-Marquardt-based algorithm and avoids the possible failures caused by the bad initial guesses. Meanwhile, we theoretically investigate the VLP system by deriving the Cramer-Rao lower bound and the root mean square error bound as the positioning accuracy limit and study the impact of system parameters on the positioning error. Finally, we experimentally evaluate the performance of the improved VLP system. It achieves highly robust and fast 3-D positioning with centimeter-level accuracy.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07900356.pdf","startPage":"6087","endPage":"6094","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2693299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2693299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7900356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Sensor Based Visible Light Positioning System With Improved Positioning Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["LED lamps","Receivers","Cameras","Robustness","Matrices","Root mean square"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sensors","indoor navigation","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["centimeter-level accuracy","3-D positioning","root mean square error bound","Cramer-Rao lower bound","robustness","singular value decomposition","close-form expression","improved positioning algorithm","visible light positioning system","image sensor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Visible light positioning (VLP)","light emitting diode (LED)","close-form solution","Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB)","root mean square error (RMSE) bound"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900356/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Image Sensor Based Visible Light Positioning System With Improved Positioning Algorithm","volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7900356/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"16870671","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Image Sensor Based Visible Light Positioning System With Improved Positioning Algorithm","sourcePdf":"access-zhang-2693299-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071804S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7900356","onlineDate":"14 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7900360,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoge Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/8310719/7900360/zhang-2691666-small.gif","p":["Xiaoge Zhang received the B.S. degree from the Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China, in 2011, and the M.S. degree from Southwest University, Chongqing, in 2014.

Second, we extend it further to resolve the network design problem with multiple source nodes and sink nodes. At last, we demonstrate that the Physarum solver converges to the user-optimized (Wardrop) equilibrium by dynamically updating the costs of links in the network. In addition, convergence of the developed algorithm is proved. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. The superiority of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated in comparison with several other algorithms, including the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, conjugate Frank-Wolfe algorithm, biconjugate Frank-Wolfe algorithm, and gradient projection algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/8310719/07900360.pdf","startPage":"1304","endPage":"1315","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2017.2691666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2017.2691666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8310719","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7900360","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bio-Inspired Approach to Traffic Network Equilibrium Assignment Problem","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Transportation","Mathematical model","Heuristic algorithms","Joining processes","Electron tubes","Approximation algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directed graphs","network theory (graphs)","optimisation","road traffic","transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Physarum polycephalum slime mold","bio-inspired approach","user-optimized equilibrium","multiple source nodes","network design problem","asymmetric graphs","directed graphs","shortest path problem","mathematical model","transportation networks","equilibrium state","traffic network equilibrium assignment problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network optimization","physarum","traffic assignment","user equilibrium"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900360/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Bio-Inspired Approach to Traffic Network Equilibrium Assignment Problem","volume":"48","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7900360/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17630357","pubMedId":"28422679","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bio-Inspired Approach to Traffic Network Equilibrium Assignment Problem","sourcePdf":"tcyb-mahadevan-2691666-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112932S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"8310719","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8310719","articleId":"7900360","onlineDate":"14 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7900361,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Babaie-Fishani","affiliation":["Caeleste, Mechelen, Belgium","Electronics and Information Systems Department, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7987836/7900361/babai-2688364-small.gif","p":["Amir Babaie-Fishani was born in Tehran, Iran, in 1986.

The system is based on the combination of a VCO and a digital counter. It is shown how this combination can function as a continuous-time integrator to form a high-order continuous-time sigma-delta modulator (CT-SDM). The counter consists only of digital building blocks, and the VCOs are implemented using ring oscillators, which are also digital-friendly. No traditional analog blocks, such as opamps, OTAs, or comparators, are used. As a proof of concept, we have implemented a third-order VCO-based CT-SDM for a 10-MHz bandwidth in the low-power version of a 65-nm CMOS technology. This prototype shows a measured performance of 71/66.2/62.5-dB DR/SNR/SNDR at a 10-MHz bandwidth while consuming 1.8 mW from a 1.0-V analog and 1.9 mW from a 1.2-V digital supply. With digital calibration, the nonlinearity could be pushed below the noise level, leading to an improved peak SNDR of 66 dB.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2017.2688364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2017.2688364","startPage":"2141","endPage":"2153","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/7987836/07900361.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7987836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Mostly Digital VCO-Based CT-SDM With Third-Order Noise Shaping","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900361/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Mostly Digital VCO-Based CT-SDM With Third-Order Noise Shaping","volume":"52","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17047900","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7900361/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fund for Scientific Research Flanders (FWO-Vlaanderen), Belgium"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Mostly Digital VCO-Based CT-SDM With Third-Order Noise Shaping","sourcePdf":"jssc-babaiefishani-2688364-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095361S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"7987836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"7987836","articleId":"7900361","onlineDate":"14 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7900363,"authors":[{"name":"Seyed-Mojtaba Sadrpour","affiliation":["Antenna and Microwave Research Laboratory, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7936705/7900363/sadrp-2694468-small.gif","p":["Seyed-Mojtaba Sadrpour was born in Yazd, Iran, in 1991.

In fact, the proposed scheme is essentially a finite-difference solution of the vector wave equation in time domain. Therefore, only one of the electric or magnetic fields needs to be updated during the iterations of the algorithm. Most importantly, the implicit updating equations of the proposed methods can be solved simultaneously thereby significantly reducing run time.

It is concluded that the movement of ships, the velocity and direction, for instance, can be detected by using either a single GF-4 image that has short time lags between bands, or time-series GF-4 images that have a short interval between their acquisition times, implying that GF-4 satellite images have the potentiality for the monitoring of moving ships.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900364/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7900364/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16899222","volume":"14","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Application Potential of GF-4 Images for Dynamic Ship Monitoring","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41301500 and 41431174"},{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFB0502504"},{"fundingName":"program of Major Special Project-the China High-Resolution Earth Observation System"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41601375"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application Potential of GF-4 Images for Dynamic Ship Monitoring","sourcePdf":"lgrs-zhang-2687700-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045314S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"7932214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7932214","articleId":"7900364","onlineDate":"14 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7900367,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyong Yu","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and System Sciences, Xinjiang University, Urumqi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/8491740/7900367/yu-2687944-small.gif","p":["Zhiyong Yu was born in Gansu, China, in 1991.

In order to reach consensus, a necessary and sufficient condition depending on the coupling gains, the communication width, the sampling period, and the spectrum of the Laplacian matrix, is established. Furthermore, the feasible region of communication width is derived for given coupling gains and structure of network. Besides, the coupling gains are also carefully designed. On the other hand, when the time delay exists in the sampling process, a time delayed protocol is proposed. A necessary and sufficient condition based on the communication width, the sampling period, the coupling gains, the time delay, and the network structure is also derived for achieving consensus. It is amazing found that the sampling period should have both lower and upper bounds for given time delay and communication width for the sake of reaching consensus. Finally, several numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2017.2687944","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/8491740/07900367.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2017.2687944","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8491740","startPage":"1986","endPage":"2002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Second-Order Consensus for Multiagent Systems via Intermittent Sampled Data Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7900367","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Second-Order Consensus for Multiagent Systems via Intermittent Sampled Data Control","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900367/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18164994","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7900367/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008845","fundingName":"Xinjiang University","grantNumber":"XJUBSCX-2015006"},{"fundingName":"Excellent Doctor Innovation Program of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region","grantNumber":"XJGRI2016001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61164004, 61473244, 61563048 and 11402223"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Second-Order Consensus for Multiagent Systems via Intermittent Sampled Data Control","sourcePdf":"tsmc-jiang-2687944-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138968S","chronDate":"Nov.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"8491740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8491740","articleId":"7900367","onlineDate":"14 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":7900370,"authors":[{"name":"You-Wei Chen","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Photonics and Optoelectronics, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["You-Wei Chen was born in 1988.

The relative amount of the multicode interference (MCI) in the MC-CDMA PON can be efficiently suppressed by applying the minimum mean square error based MCI cancellation processing and be analyzed in term of the error vector magnitude deviation. Due to the double sideband nature of the directly modulated colorless laser diode, both OFDM and MC-CDMA formats suffer from severe power fading after fiber transmission. Partial subcarriers in the OFDM-PON fail to reach the specified forward error correction (FEC) threshold, causing a huge performance deviation among subcarriers and a 3% data loss after 75-km transmission. In contrast, a distance transparency transmitter design for subscribers ranging from back-to-back to 50 km is achieved in the MC-CDMA PON scheme, and the received performance among subcarriers are equalized under the FEC criterion even after 75-km transmission. Therefore, the MC-CDMA exhibits superior performance when comparing with the OFDM format in the directly modulated colorless laser diode based LR-PONs.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2017.2694438","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7932275/07900370.pdf","startPage":"2646","endPage":"2653","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2017.2694438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7932275","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constructed MC-CDMA LR-PON With Colorless Laser Diode and Multicode Interference Cancellation DSP","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7900370","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"July1, 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900370/","displayDocTitle":"Constructed MC-CDMA LR-PON With Colorless Laser Diode and Multicode Interference Cancellation DSP","volume":"35","issue":"13","publicationDate":"1 July1, 2017","accessionNumber":"16898809","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7900370/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 103-2221-E-002-042-MY3, MOST 103-2218-E-002-017-MY3, MOST 104-2221-E-002-117-MY3 and MOST 105-2218-E-005-003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constructed MC-CDMA LR-PON With Colorless Laser Diode and Multicode Interference Cancellation DSP","sourcePdf":"jlt-lin-2694438-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118549S","chronDate":"July1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7932275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7932275","articleId":"7900370","onlineDate":"14 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7900379,"authors":[{"name":"Ye Fan","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7900379/fan-2694478-small.gif","p":["Ye Fan received the B.S. degree from the Department of Information Engineering, Chang\u2019an University in 2012, and the M.S. degree from the Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xian, China, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

There exists an eavesdropper which is equipped with Ne antennas close to the legitimate users. In order to eliminate the multiuser interference and keep the system security, interference alignment is mainly utilized in the proposed broadcast wiretap channel (BWC) and multi-access BWC (MBWC), and cooperative jamming is adopted as a supplementary approach in the MBWC model. The general feasibility conditions of the interference alignment are deduced as M \u2265 K - 1, 2M > N and N \u2265 ((K(K - 1))/2). In the BWC model, we have deduced the secure degrees of freedom (SDOF) as K min{M, N} - min{N\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e</sub>\n, K(K - 1)/2}, which is always a positive value. While in the MBWC model, the SDOF is given by K min{M, N}. Finally, since the relay transmits the synthesized signals of the legal signal and the jamming signal in the MBWC model, we propose a power allocation scheme to maximize the secrecy rate. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed power allocation scheme can improve secrecy rate under various antenna configurations.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2694478","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07900379.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2694478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","startPage":"5747","endPage":"5759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical Layer Security Based on Interference Alignment in K-User MIMO Y Wiretap Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7900379","topic":"Exploiting the Benefits of Interference in Wireless Networks: Energy Harvesting and Security","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Physical Layer Security Based on Interference Alignment in K-User MIMO Y Wiretap Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900379/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2017","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"16870692","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7900379/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61431011"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Program of Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2011K06-10"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central University"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project","grantNumber":"2012ZX03003-013-002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Physical Layer Security Based on Interference Alignment in K-User MIMO Y Wiretap Channels","sourcePdf":"access-fan-2694478-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139018S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Exploiting the Benefits of Interference in Wireless Networks: Energy Harvesting and Security"],"articleId":"7900379","onlineDate":"14 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7900383,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Lv","affiliation":["Advanced Vehicle Engineering Centre, Cranfield University, Cranfield, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8031005/7900383/chen-2694414-small.gif","p":["Chen Lv received the Ph.D. degree in automotive engineering from\n Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2016.","He is currently a Research Fellow in the Advanced Vehicle Engineering Center, Cranfield University, Cranfield, U.K.\n From 2014 to 2015, he was a joint Ph.D. Researcher in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department,\n University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.

The control characteristics under different input pressures and varied coil currents are investigated. Moreover, the sensitivity of the proposed modulation on valve's key structure parameters and environmental temperatures are explored with some unexpected drawbacks.

The main novelty of the proposed algorithm is the use of an adaptive quadratic constraint that allows obtaining enhanced solutions for both transient and steady-state phases of the iterative process. As a consequence, the proposed algorithm, termed adaptive-projection quadratically constrained stochastic gradient (AP-QCSG) algorithm, is capable of outperforming other constrained stochastic gradient (CSG) algorithms from the literature.

A novel adaptive impedance control is proposed for the robotic manipulator, whose end-effector's motions are constrained by human arm motion limits. In order to minimized motion tracking errors and acquire an optimal impedance mode of human arms, the linear quadratic regulation (LQR) is formulated; then, integral reinforcement learning (IRL) has been proposed to solve the given LQR with little information of the human arm model. Considering human-robot interaction force during the robot performing manipulation, a novel barrier-Lyapunov-function-based adaptive impedance control incorporating adaptive parameter learning is developed for physical limits, transient perturbations, and time-varying dynamics. Experimental results validate that the proposed controller is effective in assisting the operator to perform the human-robot cooperative task.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Impedance Control of Human\u2013Robot Cooperation Using Reinforcement Learning","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2017.2694391","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8031005/07900394.pdf","startPage":"8013","endPage":"8022","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2017.2694391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8031005","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7900394","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900394/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Impedance Control of Human\u2013Robot Cooperation Using Reinforcement Learning","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7900394/","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17169521","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61573147, 91520201 and 61625303"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012241","fundingName":"Guangzhou Research Collaborative Innovation Projects","grantNumber":"2014Y2-00507"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Science and Technology Research Collaborative Innovation Projects","grantNumber":"2013B010102010, 2014B090901056 and 2015B020214003"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Science and Technology Plan Project"},{"fundingName":"Application Technology Research Foundation","grantNumber":"2015B020233006"},{"fundingName":"National High-Tech Research and Development Program of China (863 Program)","grantNumber":"2015AA042303"},{"fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System, Harbin Institute of Technology","grantNumber":"SKLRS-2016-KF-04"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Impedance Control of Human\u2013Robot Cooperation Using Reinforcement Learning","sourcePdf":"tie-li-2694391-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086422S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8031005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8031005","articleId":"7900394","onlineDate":"14 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7900408,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Zhou","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/8006322/7900408/zhou-2679705-small.gif","p":["Yu Zhou received the B.Sc. degree in electronics and information engineering and the M.Sc. degree in circuits and systems from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2009 and 2012, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2017.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China.

In presence of measurement noise, conventional methods such as l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n norm relaxation methods and greedy algorithms, have shown their weakness in finding the nonzero entries accurately. In order to reduce the impact of noise and better locate the nonzero entries, in this paper, we propose a two-phase algorithm which works in a coarse-to-fine manner. In phase 1, a decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is applied to generate a group of robust solutions by optimizing l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n norm of the solutions. To remove the interruption of noise, the statistical features with respect to each entry among these solutions are extracted and an initial set of nonzero entries are determined by clustering technique. In phase 2, a forward-based selection method is proposed to further update this set and locate the nonzero entries more precisely based on these features. At last, the magnitudes of the reconstructed signal are obtained by the method of least squares. We conduct the comparison of our proposed method with several state-of-the-art compressive sensing recover methods, the best result in phase 1 and the approach combining phases 1 and 2 without the statistical features. Experimental results on benchmark signals as well as randomly generated signals demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the above methods, achieving higher recover precision and maintaining larger sparsity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/8006322/07900408.pdf","startPage":"2651","endPage":"2663","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions

to analog interference cancellation is proposed for scenarios where the interference source is known at the receiver. Beyond conventional solutions, the proposed interference cancellation scheme has two merits: 1) it is implemented with analog signal processing, which is suitable for the systems with extremely strong interference and 2) it does not need any training process for adjusting parameters of analog devices, which reduces the computational complexity and time delay. For the purpose of performance evaluation, the power spectral density expressions are formulated in closed form for the desired signal and the interference components after the proposed blind interference cancellation. Furthermore, illustrative numerical results not only substantiate the outstanding performance of the proposed scheme, specifically in the case of strong interference, but also provide useful principles for the pulse shaping filter design in the transceiver.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2694427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8007375","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2694427","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8007375/07900411.pdf","startPage":"1867","endPage":"1870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Analog Interference Cancellation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Blind Analog Interference Cancellation","volume":"21","issue":"8","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7900411/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17099403","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900411/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671024"},{"fundingName":"Hong-Kong, Macao and Taiwan Science & Technology Cooperation Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFE0123200 and 2016YFE0122900"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Analog Interference Cancellation","sourcePdf":"lcomm-ma-2694427-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055529S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8007375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8007375","articleId":"7900411","onlineDate":"14 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7900417,"authors":[{"name":"Carolina Mora Lopez","affiliation":["imec, Heverlee, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/7933280/7900417/lopez-2646901-small.gif","p":["Carolina Mora Lopez (M\u201915) received the Ph.D. degree in\n electrical engineering from KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, in collaboration with imec, Leuven, Belgium, in 2012.","Currently, she is a Researcher with the Biomedical Circuits team at imec, designing and testing microelectronic\n interfaces for neural-sensing applications.

Due to the requirement of synchronism of the whole grid, load frequency control (LFC) has become one of the essential challenges for power system stability and security. In this paper, by modeling the disturbances and parameter uncertainties into the LFC model, we propose an adaptive supplementary control scheme for the power system frequency regulation. An improved sliding mode control (SMC) is employed as the basic controller, where a new sliding mode variable is specifically proposed for the LFC problem. The adaptive dynamic programming strategy is used to provide the supplementary control signal, which is beneficial to the frequency regulation by adapting to the real-time disturbances and uncertainties. The stability analysis is also provided to guarantee the reliability of the proposed control strategy. For comparison, a particle swarm optimization-based SMC scheme is developed as the optimal parameter controller for the frequency regulation problem. Simulation studies are performed on single-area and multiarea benchmark systems, and comparative results illustrate the favorable performance of the proposed adaptive approach for the frequency regulation under load disturbances and parameter uncertainties.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency control","Power system stability","Load modeling","Uncertain systems","Adaptation models","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","dynamic programming","frequency control","load regulation","particle swarm optimisation","power system control","power system interconnection","power system security","power system stability","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sliding mode design","load frequency control","power system","adaptive learning strategy","power load demand","renewable generations","interconnected power systems","sliding mode control","adaptive supplementary control","power system frequency regulation","adaptive dynamic programming strategy","real-time disturbances","particle swarm optimization-based SMC scheme","optimal parameter controller","frequency regulation problem","multiarea benchmark systems","frequency regulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive dynamic programming (ADP)","disturbances and uncertainties","load frequency control (LFC)","particle swarm optimization (PSO)","sliding mode control (SMC)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIE.2017.2694396","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7973108/07900419.pdf","startPage":"6742","endPage":"6751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7973108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2017.2694396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Sliding Mode Design for Load Frequency Control of Power System Integrated an Adaptive Learning Strategy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7900419","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/41/7973108/7900419-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improved Sliding Mode Design for Load Frequency Control of Power System Integrated an Adaptive Learning Strategy","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900419/","volume":"64","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7900419/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17026506","dateOfInsertion":"11 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51529701 and 61520106009"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS 1053717 and CMMI 1526835"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006606","fundingName":"Tianjin Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"14JCQNJC05400"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Improved Sliding Mode Design for Load Frequency Control of Power System Integrated an Adaptive Learning Strategy","sourcePdf":"tie-he-2694396-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.286363S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7973108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"7973108","articleId":"7900419","onlineDate":"14 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7900423,"authors":[{"name":"Youngjong Ko","affiliation":["Chair of Power Electronics, Christian-Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8126282/7900423/ko-2694455-small.gif","p":["Youngjong Ko (S\u201916) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in\n electronic engineering from Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea, in 2009 and 2012, respectively.

However, since the CHB converter can be composed by cells with different remaining lifetime, it could be useful to delay a fault of higher aged cells in order to prolong the entire converter's lifetime. In this paper, a thermally compensated discontinuous pulse width modulation (DPWM) strategy is proposed in order to reduce the thermal stress for power semiconductors in power modules of higher aged cells. Considering the thermal cycles as the most influencing cause of wear out of power modules, the proposed method compensates the thermal cycles under a varying power profile by manipulating the clamping angle of the DPWM. Moreover, the proposed method obtains a comparable total harmonic distortion performance to the phase-shifted carrier modulation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8126282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2017.2694455","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8126282/07900423.pdf","startPage":"2704","endPage":"2713","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2017.2694455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermally Compensated Discontinuous Modulation Strategy for Cascaded H-Bridge Converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","displayDocTitle":"Thermally Compensated Discontinuous Modulation Strategy for Cascaded H-Bridge Converters","volume":"33","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7900423/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17427534","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7900423/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Union/Interreg V-A -

A flexible dense wavelength division multiplexed (DWDM) grid is key to efficiently accommodating media channels requiring more (or less) than 50 GHz of contiguous spectrum. In particular, routing media channels consisting of multiple adjacent carriers enables packing them closer together and sharing a single pair of guard bands of adaptive width to cope with optical filtering. This effect is maximized by giving preference to deploying media channels with more carriers. However, designing the DWDM network in such a way can translate into resource overprovisioning whenever the traffic requirements between two nodes are below the (large) capacity of the most spectrally efficient media channel format that can be deployed between those nodes. This paper provides insight on how the set of media channels and the network design framework used impact the trade-off between maximizing SE and minimizing resource overprovisioning in transparent flexible-grid optical networks. Furthermore, it discusses enabling strategies to mitigate the risk of resource overprovisioning when maximizing network SE is the key design objective.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563700/7901434/07901444.pdf","startPage":"C35","endPage":"C44","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.9.000C35","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.9.000C35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7901434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing transparent flexible-grid optical networks for maximum spectral efficiency [Invited]","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7901444/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","displayDocTitle":"Designing transparent flexible-grid optical networks for maximum spectral efficiency [Invited]","publicationDate":"April 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2017","accessionNumber":"16808549","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing transparent flexible-grid optical networks for maximum spectral efficiency [Invited]","sourcePdf":"10_C35.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021857S","chronDate":"April  2017","isNumber":"7901434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"8","articleId":"7901444","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7901448,"authors":[{"name":"Isabella Cerutti","affiliation":["Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa, Toscana, IT"],"firstName":"Isabella","lastName":"Cerutti"},{"name":"Jan Alain Corvera","affiliation":["Ateneo de Manila University, Quezon City, PH"],"firstName":"Jan Alain","lastName":"Corvera"},{"name":"Samuel Matthew Dumlao","affiliation":["Ateneo de Manila University, Quezon City, PH"],"firstName":"Samuel Matthew","lastName":"Dumlao"},{"name":"Rosula Reyes","affiliation":["Ateneo de Manila University, Quezon City, PH"],"firstName":"Rosula","lastName":"Reyes"},{"name":"Piero Castoldi","affiliation":["Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa, Toscana, IT"],"firstName":"Piero","lastName":"Castoldi"},{"name":"Nicola Andriolli","affiliation":["Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa, Toscana, IT"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Andriolli"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-0620"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0639"}],"articleNumber":"7901448","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":225},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation and FPGA-based implementation of iterative parallel schedulers for optical interconnection networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7901448","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ports (Computers)","Optical switches","Hardware","Optical interconnections","Scheduling","Multiprocessor interconnection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","iterative methods","optical interconnections","optimisation","packet switching","telecommunication scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet latency","hardware implementation","execution time","resource utilization","field programmable gate array boards","network performance","hardware optimization","iSLIP algorithm","longest-queue-first algorithm","iterative parallel implementation","computational efficiency","iterative scheduling algorithms","optical domain","low-latency schedulers","optical devices","packet transmissions","electronic scheduler","hardware architecture","optical solutions","power consumption","scalability","bandwidth density","on-chip data communication","intraboard data communication","interboard data communication","high-performance interconnection networks","optical interconnection networks","iterative parallel schedulers","FPGA-based implementation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hardware programming; Interconnectionnetwork; Optical interconnects; Packet switching;Scheduling."]}],"abstract":"High-performance interconnection networks are required for inter-board, intra-board, and on-chip data communication. With the growth of data communication, the requirements for high bandwidth density, high scalability, low latency, and low power consumption are becoming more stringent, making optical solutions appealing. Such requirements should be achieved not only by the hardware architecture but also by the electronic scheduler that is in charge of deciding the packet transmissions and controlling the optical devices. In particular, low-latency schedulers are of paramount importance-especially for optical interconnection networks whose switching capabilities may be constrained by the optical domain. This paper focuses on the hardware implementation and optimization of a scheduler suitable for optical interconnection networks. Parallel, iterative scheduling algorithms are considered for high computational efficiency. More specifically, an iterative parallel implementation of the longestqueue- first algorithm (ipLQF) is proposed and compared to the well-known iSLIP algorithm. Hardware optimization is carried out to improve their implementation efficiency. Although ipLQF achieves better network performance in terms of packet latency, the hardware implementation indicates that iSLIP stands for execution time and resource utilization in commercial field programmable gate array boards.","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.9.000C76","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.9.000C76","publicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563700/7901434/07901448.pdf","startPage":"C76","endPage":"C87","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7901434","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7901448/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","displayDocTitle":"Simulation and FPGA-based implementation of iterative parallel schedulers for optical interconnection networks","volume":"9","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16808546","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation and FPGA-based implementation of iterative parallel schedulers for optical interconnection networks","sourcePdf":"14_C76.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082876S","chronDate":"April  2017","isNumber":"7901434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"7","articleId":"7901448","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":7901454,"authors":[{"name":"Fulong Yan","affiliation":["Beihang University, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Fulong","lastName":"Yan"},{"name":"Wang Miao","affiliation":["Electro-Optical Communications Group, COBRA Research Institute, Eindhoven University of Technology, 5612 AZ Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Miao"},{"name":"Oded Raz","affiliation":["Electro-Optical Communications Group, COBRA Research Institute, Eindhoven University of Technology, 5612 AZ Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Oded","lastName":"Raz"},{"name":"Nicola Calabretta","affiliation":["Electro-Optical Communications Group, COBRA Research Institute, Eindhoven University of Technology, 5612 AZ Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Calabretta"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-0620"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0639"}],"articleNumber":"7901454","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":609},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7901454","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical switches","Optical buffering","Optical packet switching","Servers","Wavelength division multiplexing","Transceivers","Optical interconnections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arrayed waveguide gratings","computer centres","numerical analysis","optical communication equipment","optical control","optical interconnections","optical switches","optical testing","packet switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flow-controlled optical packet switches","hierarchical data center network architectures","optical flat DCN architecture","OPS port count","interand intra-cluster networks","single-hop OPS","wavelength switching","statistical multiplexing operations","numerical simulation","server-to-server latency","electrical switches","arrayed wave guide grating router"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data center architecture; OMNeT++ simulation;Optical flow control; Optical packet switch"]}],"doi":"10.1364/JOCN.9.000291","publicationTitle":"IEEE/OSA Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/OSA Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563700/7901434/07901454.pdf","startPage":"291","endPage":"303","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.9.000291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7901434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opsquare: A flat DCN architecture based on flow-controlled optical packet switches","abstract":"Aiming at solving the scaling issues of bandwidth and latency in current hierarchical data center network (DCN) architectures, we propose and investigate a novel optical flat DCN architecture in which the number of interconnected ToRs scales as the square of the optical packet switches' (OPS) port count (OPSquare). The proposed flat DCN architecture consists of two parallel interand intra-cluster networks that are built on a single-hop OPS with nanosecond time and wavelength switching for efficient statistical multiplexing operations. Fast optical flow control is implemented for solving packet contentions that may occur at the buffer-less optical switches. The performance of OPSquare DCN in terms of scalability, packet loss, latency, and throughput is assessed by a numerical simulation employing OMNeT++ under realistic data center (DC) traffic.

The word \u201cedge\u201d may carry different meanings. A common usage of the term refers to the edge network as opposed to the core network, with equipment such as edge routers, base stations, and home gateways. In that sense, there are several differences between fog and edge. First, fog is inclusive of cloud, core, metro, edge, clients, and things. The fog architecture will further enable pooling, orchestrating, managing, and securing the resources and functions distributed in the cloud, anywhere along the cloud-to-thing continuum, and on the things to support end-to-end services and applications. Second, fog seeks to realize a seamless continuum of computing services from the cloud to the things rather than treating the network edges as isolated computing platforms. Third, fog envisions a horizontal platform that will support the common fog computing functions for multiple industries and application domains, including but not limited to traditional telco services. Fourth, a dominant part of edge is mobile edge, whereas the fog computing architecture will be flexible enough to work over wireline as well as wireless networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7901470/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","volume":"55","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"16808456","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7901470/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Clarifying Fog Computing and Networking: 10 Questions and Answers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clarifying Fog Computing and Networking: 10 Questions and Answers","sourcePdf":"012COMMAG_FOG_COMPUTING_TUTORIAL_Rev2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020766S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7901458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"7901458","articleId":"7901470","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7901472,"authors":[{"name":"Qiyun He","affiliation":["Simon Fraser University"],"bio":{"p":["Qiyun He (qiyunh@cs.sfu.ca) received a B.Eng. degree from Zhejiang University, China, and a B.Sc. degree from Simon Fraser University, British Columbia, Canada, both in 2015.

The heterogeneous qualities and formats of the source streams, however, require massive computational resources to transcode them into multiple industrial standard quality versions to serve viewers with distinct configurations, and the delays to the viewers of different locations should be well synchronized to support community interactions. This article attempts to address these challenges and to explore the opportunities with new generation computation paradigms, in particular, fog computing. We present a novel fog-based transcoding framework for CLS platforms to offload the transcoding workload to the network edge (i.e., the massive number of viewers). We evaluate our design through our PlanetLab-based experiment and real-world viewer transcoding experiment.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/7901458/07901472.pdf","startPage":"28","endPage":"33","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2017.1600826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2017.1600826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7901458","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7901472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fog-Based Transcoding for Crowdsourced Video Livecast","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Edge computing","Streaming media","TV","Crowdsourcing","Synchronization","Transcoding","Cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","crowdsourcing","transcoding","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fog-based transcoding","crowdsourced livecast service","CLS platform","live streaming","video content","fog computing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7901472/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Fog-Based Transcoding for Crowdsourced Video Livecast","volume":"55","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7901472/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16808466","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fog-Based Transcoding for Crowdsourced Video Livecast","sourcePdf":"014HE_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037579S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7901458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7901458","articleId":"7901472","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":7901473,"authors":[{"name":"Songze Li","affiliation":["University of Southern California"],"bio":{"p":["Songze Li [S'09] (songzeli@use.edu) received his B.S. in electrical engineering from Polytechnic Institute of New York University (now NYU Tandon School of Engineering) in 2011, and his M.S. in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California in 2016.

This article envisions a real-time, context-aware collaboration framework that lies at the edge of the RAN, comprising MEC servers and mobile devices, and amalgamates the heterogeneous resources at the edge. Specifically, we introduce and study three representative use cases ranging from mobile edge orchestration, collaborative caching and processing, and multi-layer interference cancellation.

Existing systems fall short of satisfying these requirements, but emerging network softwarization and resource virtualization technologies, such as SDN and NFV, show promise for being key enablers in this context.

In this article, we describe best practices for meeting the challenging coexistence, harmonic management, linearity, and efficiency performance related to the functional partitioning, optimized integration, and technology selection of the RFFE. Recent trends to improve radio performance are driving specific blocks (e.g., the low noise amplifier) into the RFFE, with associated architecture changes in both primary and diversity paths. Carrier aggregation features are supported in a number of different methods with different insertion loss, isolation, and noise figure trade-offs, and here we examine benefits of a new category of highly integrated diversity receive modules to enhance receiver sensitivity across all use cases. Movement toward higher order MIMO in the DL is compounding additional RF Rx path support and requirements, and cost-effective solutions for optimum performance trade-offs require a holistic and complete RF system view of both Tx and Rx in order to address these emerging requirements.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/7901458/07901492.pdf","startPage":"134","endPage":"141","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2017.1601221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2017.1601221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7901458","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7901492","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LTE-Advanced Pro RF Front-End Implementations to Meet Emerging Carrier Aggregation and DL MIMO Requirements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO communication","Mobile communication","Signal to noise ratio","Transmitting antennas","Long Term Evolution","Receiving antennas","Integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","harmonics","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated diversity receive modules","higher order MIMO","higher order modulation","multicomponent carrier aggregation","DL MIMO","RFFE architectures","LTE-Advanced pro RF front-end"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7901492/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"LTE-Advanced Pro RF Front-End Implementations to Meet Emerging Carrier Aggregation and DL MIMO Requirements","volume":"55","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7901492/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16808459","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LTE-Advanced Pro RF Front-End Implementations to Meet Emerging Carrier Aggregation and DL MIMO Requirements","sourcePdf":"034PEHLKE_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03154S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7901458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7901458","articleId":"7901492","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7901493,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Zhou","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"],"bio":{"p":["Jin Zhou [S'11, M'17] received his B.S. degree in electronics science and technology from Wuhan University, China, in 2008, his M.S. degree in microelectronics from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2011, and his Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Columbia University, New York, in 2017.

However, the implementation of integrated full duplex radios is fraught with several fundamental challenges. Achieving the levels of self-interference cancellation required over the wide bandwidths mandated by emerging wireless standards is challenging in an integrated circuit implementation. The dynamic range limitations of integrated electronics restrict the transmitter power levels and receiver noise floor levels that can be supported in integrated full duplex radios. Advances in compact antenna interfaces for full duplex are also required. Finally, networks employing full duplex nodes will require a complete rethinking of the medium access control layer as well as cross-layer interaction and co-design. This article describes recent research results that address these challenges. Several generations of full duplex transceiver ICs are described that feature novel RF self-interference cancellation circuits, antenna cancellation techniques, and a non-magnetic CMOS circulator. Resource allocation algorithms and rate gain/improvement characterizations are also discussed for full duplex configurations involving IC-based nodes.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2017.1600583","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/7901458/07901493.pdf","startPage":"142","endPage":"151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7901458","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2017.1600583","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated full duplex radios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7901493","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","displayDocTitle":"Integrated full duplex radios","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7901493/","publicationDate":"April 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16808470","htmlLink":"/document/7901493/","volume":"55","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated full duplex radios","sourcePdf":"035KRISHNASWAMY_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069665S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7901458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"7901458","articleId":"7901493","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7901495,"authors":[{"name":"Matilde Sanchez-Fernandez","affiliation":["Universidad Carlos III de Madrid"],"bio":{"p":["Matilde S\u00e1nchez-Fern\u00e1ndez [SM'14] (mati@tsc.uc3m.es) received the M.Sc. degree in telecommunications engineering and the Ph.D. degree from the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain, in 1996 and 2001, respectively.

This work studies code-aware quantizers, for finite-precision min-sum decoders, which optimize the noise threshold of the existing family of Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes. We propose a code-aware quantizer with lower complexity than that obtained by optimizing all decision levels and approaching its performance, for few quantization bits. We show that code-aware quantizers outperform code-independent quantizers in terms of noise threshold for both regular and irregular LDPC codes. To overcome the error floor behavior of LDPC codes, we propose the design of the quantizer for a target error probability at the decoder output. The results show that the quantizer optimized to get a zero error probability could lead to a very bad performance for practical range of signal to noise ratios. Finally, we propose to design jointly irregular LDPC codes and code-aware quantizers for finite-precision min-sum decoders. We show that they achieve significant decoding gains with respect to LDPC codes designed for infinite-precision belief propagation decoding, but decoded by finite-precision min-sum.","doi":"10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2016.7901540","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7895354/7901533/07901540.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7901533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2016.7901540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code-aware quantizer design for finite-precision min-sum decoders","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7901540","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 June 2016","displayDocTitle":"Code-aware quantizer design for finite-precision min-sum decoders","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7901540/","publicationDate":"2016","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2017","accessionNumber":"16809117","htmlLink":"/document/7901540/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 June 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code-aware quantizer design for finite-precision min-sum decoders","confLoc":"Varna, Bulgaria","sourcePdf":"p1mheich.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081698S","chronDate":"6-9 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7895354","isNumber":"7901533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7895354","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7901533","articleId":"7901540","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7901543,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Baldi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell' Informazione, Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Baldi","id":"37063962300"},{"name":"Massimo Battaglioni","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell' Informazione, Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Battaglioni","id":"37086079613"},{"name":"Franco Chiaraluce","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell' Informazione, Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Franco","lastName":"Chiaraluce","id":"37273242300"},{"name":"Giovanni Cancellieri","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell' Informazione, Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Cancellieri","id":"37299823800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1925-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1926-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7901543","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7901543","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolutional codes","Block codes","Conferences","Iterative decoding","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","cyclic codes","graph theory","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-invariant spatially coupled LDPCC code","low-density parity-check convolutional code syndrome former matrix","SC-LDPC code small constraint length","QC block code","quasi-cyclic block code","unwrapping procedure","Tanner graph"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Constraint length","convolutional codes","LDPC codes","local cycles length","spatially coupled codes","time-invariant codes"]}],"abstract":"We consider a special family of spatially coupled low-density parity-check (SC-LDPC) codes, that is, time-invariant low-density parity-check convolutional (LDPCC) codes, which are known in the literature for a long time.

Due to its attractive properties, it fulfills the requirements of the scenarios such as Internet of Things. On the other hand, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission is regarded as a key promising technology for 5G wireless networks. In this paper, we investigate the combination of GFDM and spatial modulation (SM) techniques. We construct the SM-GFDM system model and evaluate its error performance by comparing to spatial modulation - orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (SM-OFDM) in Rayleigh multipath fading channels. It is shown that SM-GFDM suffers a performance loss; however, due to combination of SM and GFDM, low complexity, high spectral efficiency, low out-of-band (OOB) emission, flexibility and time and frequency error toleration, which possibly surpass the small degradation in error performance, can be achieved. As a result, thanks to SM-GFDM, advantages of GFDM have been brought to MIMO application without increasing the system complexity.","doi":"10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2016.7901544","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7895354/7901533/07901544.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2016.7901544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7901533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial modulation GFDM: A low complexity MIMO-GFDM system for 5G wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7901544","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 June 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7901544/","displayDocTitle":"Spatial modulation GFDM: A low complexity MIMO-GFDM system for 5G wireless networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16809104","htmlLink":"/document/7901544/","conferenceDate":"6-9 June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial modulation GFDM: A low complexity MIMO-GFDM system for 5G wireless networks","confLoc":"Varna, Bulgaria","sourcePdf":"p21ozturk.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050764S","chronDate":"6-9 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7895354","isNumber":"7901533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7895354","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7901533","articleId":"7901544","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7901553,"authors":[{"name":"Radu Mitran","affiliation":["Communication Department, \u201cNicolae B\u0103lcescu\u201d Land Forces Academy, Sibiu, Romania"],"firstName":"Radu","lastName":"Mitran","id":"37085992587"},{"name":"Mircea Stanic","affiliation":["Communication Department, \u201cNicolae B\u0103lcescu\u201d Land Forces Academy, Sibiu, Romania"],"firstName":"Mircea","lastName":"Stanic","id":"37085990465"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1925-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1926-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7901553","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":184},"abstract":"The main challenge that HF communications face is the non-stationary behavior of the ionosphere, which imposes constraints on the signal's parameters.

(SM) is a novel and promising approach that has been introduced as an alternative to classical multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) spatial multiplexing techniques. Cooperative communications, on the other hand, provides additional diversity gains and high data rates by improving coverage. Combining the advantages of SM and cooperative communications would then further improve efficiency. Most of the studies in the literature of cooperative SM systems consider the space shift keying (SSK) modulation, which is a special case of SM, and single receive/transmit antenna relay (R) and destination (D). In this work, we investigate the average bit error probability (ABEP) of a decode-and-forward (DF) cooperative SM system where all nodes have multiple transmit and/or receive antennas which has not been studied before. It is shown that the derived analytical expressions for the ABEP are in close match with the computer simulation results. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the cooperative SM scheme provides 4 dB SNR gain compared to classical M-ary modulated cooperative systems.","doi":"10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2016.7901557","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7895354/7901533/07901557.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2016.7901557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7901533","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of cooperative spatial modulation with multiple-antennas at relay","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7901557","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of cooperative spatial modulation with multiple-antennas at relay","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 June 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7901557/","conferenceDate":"6-9 June 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16809123","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7901557/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of cooperative spatial modulation with multiple-antennas at relay","confLoc":"Varna, Bulgaria","sourcePdf":"p85altn.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08792S","chronDate":"6-9 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7895354","isNumber":"7901533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7895354","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7901533","articleId":"7901557","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7901563,"authors":[{"name":"Sema Sara\u00e7","affiliation":["Dept.of Electronics and Communication Eng., Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Sema","lastName":"Sara\u00e7","id":"37085996416"},{"name":"\u00dcmit Ayg\u00f6l\u00fc","affiliation":["Dept.of Electronics and Communication Eng., Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"\u00dcmit","lastName":"Ayg\u00f6l\u00fc","id":"37267743300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1925-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1926-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7901563","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Protocols","Interference","Markov processes","Steady-state","Conferences","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","cognitive radio","cooperative communication","radio receivers","radio spectrum management","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ARQ-based protocol","cooperative spectrum sharing protocol","CRN underlay mode","cognitive radio network","automatic repeat request-based primary user","primary transmitter","primary receiver","S1 node","S2 node","acknowledgement message","negative-acknowledgement message"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7901563","doi":"10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2016.7901563","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a cooperative spectrum sharing protocol for cognitive radio networks (CRNs) which operate in underlay mode with an automatic repeat-request (ARQ)-based primary user (PU) including primary transmitter (PT) and primary receiver (PR) and a bidirectionally communicating secondary user (SU) which consists of the nodes S1 and S2. In ARQ-based PU, ACKnowledgement/Negative-ACKnowledgement (ACK/NACK) messages are sent from PR to PT and listened by S1 and S2 to control the PU's packet success. Si (i=1 or 2) alerts both PT and PR if its reception from PT is successed or failed and PR considers the link from Si or PT, respectively. PU transmits its packet by accessing the spectrum alone or by cooperating with SU or under an interference caused by SU. If PT transmits alone its packet successfully, in the next time slot it transmits a new packet in underlay mode during which SU access the spectrum simultaneously with a tolerable interference level to improves the PU's performance. Conversely, if PT fails to transmit alone its packet and at least one of the nodes S1 and S2 success to decode it, then S1 or S2 cooperates with PT attending as a relay to enhance the PU's throughput in the next time slot during which PT stays silent. If both of S1 and S2 fail to decode PT's packet, PT retransmits its packet in underlay mode. When the first transmission of PT's packet is failed in underlay mode, PT retransmits this packet alone. We derive analytical expressions for the throughputs of PU and SU and show that the proposed protocol significantly improves the PU's throughput compared to non-CR scheme while stabilizing the SU's throughput at high SNR values.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2016.7901563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7901533","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7895354/7901533/07901563.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An ARQ-based protocol for cooperative spectrum sharing in underlay cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7901563/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 June 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7901563/","displayDocTitle":"An ARQ-based protocol for cooperative spectrum sharing in underlay cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"6-9 June 2016","publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16809089","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An ARQ-based protocol for cooperative spectrum sharing in underlay cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Varna, Bulgaria","sourcePdf":"p115sarac.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050023S","chronDate":"6-9 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7895354","isNumber":"7901533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7895354","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7901533","articleId":"7901563","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7901564,"authors":[{"name":"Ronald Nissel","affiliation":["ITC, Christian Doppler Laboratory for Dependable Wireless Connectivity for the Society in Motion","Institute of Telecommunications, Technische Universit\u00e4t Wien, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Ronald","lastName":"Nissel","id":"37085480413"},{"name":"Markus Rupp","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, Technische Universit\u00e4t Wien, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Rupp","id":"37276736700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1925-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1926-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7901564","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Resource management","Dynamic scheduling","Bandwidth","Cognitive radio","Queueing analysis","Multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cognitive radio","game theory","queueing theory","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum allocation","cognitive radio technologies","queuing theory","channel access","load distribution","Nash equilibrium"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic spectrum allocation in cognitive radio: Throughput calculations","doi":"10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2016.7901564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7901533","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7895354/7901533/07901564.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2016.7901564","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7901564","abstract":"In this paper, we use queuing theory (egalitarian process sharing) to derive throughput expressions for dynamic spectrum allocation in cognitive radio systems.

Moreover, it does not require pilot usage in frequency domain channel estimation. Instead of data usage as cyclic prefix, pseudo-noise (PN) sequences are transmitted in guard intervals. Due to interference from the previous OFDM data symbol, the received signal in guard interval can be decomposed into a small-sized signal that contains only PN sequences utilizing the inter-block-interference (IBI)-free region in the convolution matrix. Due to sparsity, multipath fading channel can be obtained by the application of compressed sensing (CS) technique to reconstruct the high-dimensional sparse channel from the decreased-size of received signal through the known PN sequence matrix. In this study, the effect of the size of IBI-free region on CS and Bayesian CS (BCS) based channel estimation is investigated. Accordingly, reconstruction error performances of basis pursuit (BP) and BCS are compared. Simulation results show that the channel estimation can be improved by trading-off the length of the IBI-free region. However, an increase in IBI-free region leads to decreased energy efficiency at both the transmitter and receiver side.","doi":"10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2016.7901565","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7895354/7901533/07901565.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2016.7901565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7901533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of inter-block-interference-free region on compressed sensing based channel estimation in TDS-OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7901565","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 June 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7901565/","displayDocTitle":"Effect of inter-block-interference-free region on compressed sensing based channel estimation in TDS-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16809133","htmlLink":"/document/7901565/","conferenceDate":"6-9 June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of inter-block-interference-free region on compressed sensing based channel estimation in TDS-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Varna, Bulgaria","sourcePdf":"p125basaran.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056518S","chronDate":"6-9 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7895354","isNumber":"7901533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7895354","xplore-issue":"7901533","articleId":"7901565","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7901570,"authors":[{"name":"Petya Dinkova","affiliation":["Technical University of Sofia, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Petya","lastName":"Dinkova","id":"37086014656"},{"name":"Petia Georgieva","affiliation":["Technical University of Sofia, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Petia","lastName":"Georgieva","id":"37267994600"},{"name":"Agata Manolova","affiliation":["DETI/IEETA, University of Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Agata","lastName":"Manolova","id":"37078879300"},{"name":"Mariofanna Milanova","affiliation":["University of Arkansas, Little Rock, USA"],"firstName":"Mariofanna","lastName":"Milanova","id":"37269170900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1925-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1926-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7901570","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Face recognition","Face","Training","Image recognition","Quantization (signal)","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","face recognition","feature extraction","hidden Markov models","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic face recognition system","incremental singular value decomposition","subject dependent hidden Markov model","SVD-HMM recognition system","feature extraction","orthogonal decomposition","image dimensionality reduction","benchmark face dataset","YALE database","Olivetti Research Laboratory","image compression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["face recognition","singular values decomposition","feature extraction","Hidden Markov model"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present an automatic face recognition system based on incremental Singular Values Decomposition (SVD) and subject dependent Hidden Markov Models (HMM).

SVD degrades rapidly when the image is compressed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face recognition based on subject dependent Hidden Markov Models","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","doi":"10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2016.7901570","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7895354/7901533/07901570.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2016.7901570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7901533","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7901570","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7901570/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 June 2016","displayDocTitle":"Face recognition based on subject dependent Hidden Markov Models","conferenceDate":"6-9 June 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7901570/","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2017","publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16809142","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face recognition based on subject dependent Hidden Markov Models","confLoc":"Varna, Bulgaria","sourcePdf":"p148georgieva.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079174S","chronDate":"6-9 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7895354","isNumber":"7901533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7895354","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7901533","articleId":"7901570","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7901582,"authors":[{"name":"Hakan Dogan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Istanbul University, Avcilar, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Hakan","lastName":"Dogan","id":"37282432900"},{"name":"Osman \u015eayl\u0131","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Recep Tayyip Erdogan University, Rize, Turkey"],"firstName":"Osman","lastName":"\u015eayl\u0131","id":"37086007247"},{"name":"Erdal Panayirci","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Kadir Has University, Cibali, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Erdal","lastName":"Panayirci","id":"37344633800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1925-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1926-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7901582","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":363},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Interpolation","OFDM","Modulation","Bit error rate","Wireless communication","Splines (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","free-space optical communication","interpolation","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pchip interpolation-based channel estimation","linear interpolation-based channel estimation","BER performance","low-pass interpolation-based channel estimation technique","computer simulation","comb-type pilot distribution","wireless channel estimation","optical domain","ACO-OFDM","asymmetrically-clipped optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","optical data transmission","VLC system","bandwidth scarcity","wireless communication","visible light communication","visible light channels","asymmetrically-clipped optical OFDM","pilot-assisted channel estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["visible light communication","asymmetrically-clipped optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","channel estimation","interpolation"]}],"abstract":"The Visible Light Communication(VLC) has drawn significant attention recently for wireless communication in addressing the performance limitations of wireless systems due to the scarcity of bandwidth. In VLC system, the visible lights is used not only for illuminating rooms but also for an optical data transmission. Asymmetrically clipped optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (ACO-OFDM) has been proposed for VLC systems to provide optically power efficient solution in the optical domain. The estimation of wireless channel is crucial in order to detect the transmitted data coherently. In this work, different interpolation based channel estimations for comb-type pilot distribution are proposed over visible light channels. Computer simulation results have confirmed that the proposed spline and low pass interpolation based channel estimation techniques have a clear BER performance advantages compared with linear and pchip interpolation based channel estimations for higher order modulations.","doi":"10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2016.7901582","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7895354/7901533/07901582.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2016.7901582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7901533","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot assisted channel estimation for asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM over visible light channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7901582","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pilot assisted channel estimation for asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM over visible light channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 June 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7901582/","conferenceDate":"6-9 June 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16809110","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7901582/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot assisted channel estimation for asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM over visible light channels","confLoc":"Varna, Bulgaria","sourcePdf":"p207dogan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062562S","chronDate":"6-9 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7895354","isNumber":"7901533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7895354","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7901533","articleId":"7901582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7901587,"authors":[{"name":"Larysa S.

Recently, a new networking paradigm, software defined networking (SDN), has emerged to facilitate effective network control and management. In this paper, we present the advantages of leveraging SDN to detect traffic anomaly, and review recent progresses in this direction. Despite their effectiveness for traditional traffic, SDN-based traffic anomaly detection methods have to face the challenge of continuously increasing network traffic. To this end, we propose two refined algorithms to be used in an anomaly detection framework which can handle voluminous data, and report some experimental results to demonstrate their performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software-Defined-Networking-Enabled Traffic Anomaly Detection and Mitigation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2017.2694702","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8172502/07902104.pdf","startPage":"1890","endPage":"1898","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2017.2694702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8172502","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7902104","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7902104/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Software-Defined-Networking-Enabled Traffic Anomaly Detection and Mitigation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7902104/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17525628","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China10.13039/100000001","grantNumber":"51477056 and U1636216"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai Rising-Star Program","grantNumber":"15QA1401700"},{"fundingName":"CCF-Venustech Hongyan Research Initiative"},{"fundingName":"State Grid Corporation Science and Technology Project \u201cThe Pilot Application on Network Access Security for Patrol Data Captured by Unmanned Planes and Robots and Intelligent Recognition Based on Big Data Platform\u201d","grantNumber":"SGSDDK000KJJS1600065"},{"fundingName":"Pearl River Nova Program of Guangzhou","grantNumber":"2014J2200051"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007567","fundingName":"Strategic Research Grant from City University of Hong Kong","grantNumber":"7004615"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software-Defined-Networking-Enabled Traffic Anomaly Detection and Mitigation","sourcePdf":"jiot-guizani-2694702-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068645S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8172502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8172502","articleId":"7902104","onlineDate":"17 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7902105,"authors":[{"name":"Ibrahim A.

Multi-set space-time shift keying (MS-STSK) is a multiple-input multiple-output scheme, which combines the concepts of spatial modulation (SM) and STSK for the sake of achieving high data rates and enhanced system integrity. Furthermore, an MS-STSK is combined with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) as well as single-carrier frequency domain equalization (SC-FDE) and additionally enhanced by analog beamforming in order to support communications at millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies. Given that OFDM-based SM systems cannot directly benefit from the reduced number of RF chains of SM due to the spreading effects of the fast-Fourier transform and they suffer from a high peak-to-average power ratio, we opt for employing the SC-based arrangement. The soft-decision-aided detector of the SC-based MS-STSK is combined with recursive systematic convolutional encoding and iterative detection at the receiver side in order to achieve excellent performance within 1.1 dB and 1.4 dB, respectively, from the capacity limit for the soft-decision MS-STSK system and within 1.1 dB from the capacity limit for the SC-FDE-aided soft-decision MS-STSK. We also use extrinsic information transfer charts for analyzing our systems and evaluate their achievable rates.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2694557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2694557","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07902105.pdf","startPage":"7223","endPage":"7243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced-RF-Chain Aided Soft-Decision Multi-Set Steered Space-Time Shift-Keying for Millimeter-Wave Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-RF-Chain Aided Soft-Decision Multi-Set Steered Space-Time Shift-Keying for Millimeter-Wave Communications","volume":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7902105/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"16904562","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7902105/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/Noo4558/1 and EP/L018659/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council\u2019s Advanced Fellow through the Beam-Me-Up Project"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000288","fundingName":"Royal Society\u2019s Wolfson Research Merit Award"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Reduced-RF-Chain Aided Soft-Decision Multi-Set Steered Space-Time Shift-Keying for Millimeter-Wave Communications","sourcePdf":"access-hanzo-2694557-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.179071S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7902105","onlineDate":"17 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7902107,"authors":[{"name":"Aoxue Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (MOE), School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7955031/7902107/li-2689071-small.gif","p":["Aoxue Li received the B.S. degree in electronic science and technology from Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China, in 2015.

How to efficiently recognize the scenes from such HSR image data has become a critical task. Conventional approaches to remote sensing scene classification only utilize information from HSR images. Therefore, they always need a large amount of labeled data and cannot recognize the images from an unseen scene class without any visual sample in the labeled data. To overcome this drawback, we propose a novel approach for recognizing images from unseen scene classes, i.e., zero-shot scene classification (ZSSC). In this approach, we first use the well-known natural language process model, word2vec, to map names of seen/unseen scene classes to semantic vectors. A semantic-directed graph is then constructed over the semantic vectors for describing the relationships between unseen classes and seen classes. To transfer knowledge from the images in seen classes to those in unseen classes, we make an initial label prediction on test images by an unsupervised domain adaptation model. With the semantic-directed graph and initial prediction, a label-propagation algorithm is then developed for ZSSC. By leveraging the visual similarity among images from the same scene class, a label refinement approach based on sparse learning is used to suppress the noise in the zero-shot classification results. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in ZSSC.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7902107/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"16965431","htmlLink":"/document/7902107/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 June 2017","volume":"55","issue":"7","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Zero-Shot Scene Classification for High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Images","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61573363 and 61573026"},{"fundingName":"Program of China","grantNumber":"2014CB340403 and 2015CB352502"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004260","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities and the Research Funds of Renmin University of China","grantNumber":"15XNLQ01"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council FP7 Project SUNNY","grantNumber":"313243"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero-Shot Scene Classification for High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Images","sourcePdf":"tgrs-lu-2689071-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116188S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7955031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7955031","articleId":"7902107","onlineDate":"17 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7902116,"authors":[{"name":"Juan Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Juan Chen, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0002-9548-6634","id":"37600062800"},{"name":"Jianxing Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Jianxing Li, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Jianxing","lastName":"Li","id":"37085390081"},{"name":"Qing Huo Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Qing Huo Liu, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Qing Huo","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0001-5286-4423","id":"37277487800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9480"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9670"}],"articleNumber":"7902116","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":636},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphene","Conductivity","Finite difference methods","Time-domain analysis","Mathematical model","Current density","Microwave theory and techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential equations","electromagnetic wave absorption","finite difference time-domain analysis","graphene","microwave materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tunable absorption","Pade fitting method","auxiliary differential equation","weakly conditionally stable finite-difference time-domain method","WCS-FDTD method","graphene-based absorber"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Absorber","finite difference time domain (FDTD)","graphene","weakly conditionally stable (WCS)"]}],"abstract":"A weakly conditionally stable finite-difference time-domain (WCS-FDTD) method is used to simulate a graphene-based absorber.

The numerical result shows that the graphene can achieve tunable absorption through controlling its chemical potential, and the interband conductivity of the graphene has important effects on the performance of the absorber.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2017.2690659","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/8058014/07902116.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2017.2690659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8058014","startPage":"3689","endPage":"3696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analyzing Graphene-Based Absorber by Using the WCS-FDTD Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7902116","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analyzing Graphene-Based Absorber by Using the WCS-FDTD Method","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7902116/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17214123","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7902116/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61231003 and 61471292"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007128","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province, China","grantNumber":"2016JM6001"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing Graphene-Based Absorber by Using the WCS-FDTD Method","sourcePdf":"tmtt-chen-2690659-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088481S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"8058014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8058014","articleId":"7902116","onlineDate":"17 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7902117,"authors":[{"name":"Suzanne J.

Phasor measurement units are time synchronized devices that provide accurate synchrophasor measurements in power grids. The rapid deployment of PMUs enable improved real-time situational awareness to grid operators through wide area measurement systems. However, the quantity and rate of measurements obtained from PMUs is significantly higher than traditional devices, and continues to grow as more are deployed. Efficient algorithms for processing large-scale PMU data and notifying operators of anomalies is critical for real-time system monitoring. In this paper, we propose a novel, two-step anomaly detection approach that processes raw PMU data using the MapReduce paradigm. We implement our approach on a multicore system to process a dataset derived from real PMUs containing 4,500 PMUs (~18 million measurements). Our experimental results indicate the proposed approach detects constraint and temporal anomalies in under three seconds on 8 cores. Our work demonstrates the applicability of MapReduce for designing anomaly detection algorithms for the smart grid, and motivates the creation of novel MapReduce approaches for other SCADA applications.","doi":"10.1109/TETC.2017.2694804","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245516/8824015/07902117.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TETC.2017.2694804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8824015","startPage":"392","endPage":"403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leveraging MapReduce and Synchrophasors for Real-Time Anomaly Detection in the Smart Grid","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7902117","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Leveraging MapReduce and Synchrophasors for Real-Time Anomaly Detection in the Smart Grid","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept. 1 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7902117/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"3","publicationDate":"1 July-Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"18954553","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2019","htmlLink":"/document/7902117/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"U.S. Army Research Labs Faculty and Cadet Collaborative Research Program and the Network Science Center","grantNumber":"10800174"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leveraging MapReduce and Synchrophasors for Real-Time Anomaly Detection in the Smart Grid","sourcePdf":"tetc-matthews-2694804-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11592S","chronDate":"July-Sept. 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"6245516","isNumber":"8824015","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245516","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8824015","articleId":"7902117","onlineDate":"17 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7902119,"authors":[{"name":"Zhibin Pan","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhibin","lastName":"Pan","id":"37085655545"},{"name":"Xiuquan Wu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xiuquan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086117207"},{"name":"Zhengyi Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhengyi","lastName":"Li","id":"37086121492"},{"name":"Zhili Zhou","affiliation":["School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhili","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085877213"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"7902119","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":610},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7902119","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diamond","Quantization (signal)","Feature extraction","Databases","Complexity theory","Noise robustness","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image classification","image denoising","image texture","quantisation (signal)","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noise-free conditions","CUReT database","UIUC database","Outex database","texture databases","uniform patterns","noise-corrupted nonuniform pattern restoration","adaptive quantization threshold strategy","noise robustness enhancement","radial direction","feature dimensionality","DLABP","diamond sampling structure-based local adaptive binary pattern","noise-robust local image descriptor","noise sensitivity","LBP variants","texture classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Diamond sampling structure","local adaptive threshold","local binary pattern (LBP)","low complexity","texture classification"]}],"abstract":"Local binary pattern (LBP) is sensitive to the noise and suffers from limited discriminative capability, and many LBP variants are reported in the recent literatures. Although a lot of significant progresses have been made, most LBP variants still have limitations of noise sensitivity, high dimensionality, and computational inefficiency. In view of this, we propose a new noise-robust local image descriptor named the diamond sampling structure-based local adaptive binary pattern (DLABP) in this letter, which aims at achieving both efficiency and simplicity at the same time. It mainly features three contributions: 1) an effective diamond sampling structure to decrease the feature dimensionality significantly by fixing the number of sampling neighbors to a constant of 8; 2) a simple and new \u201caverage method on the radial direction\u201d to enhance the noise robustness; and 3) an effective adaptive quantization threshold strategy to restore the noise-corrupted nonuniform patterns back to possible uniform patterns. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmark texture databases of Outex, UIUC, and CUReT. Compared to state-of-the-art LBP-like methods, the proposed approach consistently demonstrates superior performances both in noise-free conditions and in the presence of high levels of noise, while it has a low complexity and a smaller feature dimension.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7901503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2017.2694460","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/7901503/07902119.pdf","startPage":"828","endPage":"832","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2017.2694460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local Adaptive Binary Patterns Using Diamond Sampling Structure for Texture Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","displayDocTitle":"Local Adaptive Binary Patterns Using Diamond Sampling Structure for Texture Classification","volume":"24","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7902119/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16835079","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7902119/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Open Research Fund of Key Laboratory of Spectral Imaging Technology","grantNumber":"LSIT201606D"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002367","fundingName":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"fundingName":"Open Project Program of the State Key Lab of Novel Software Technology","grantNumber":"KFKT2016B14"},{"fundingName":"Nanjing University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local Adaptive Binary Patterns Using Diamond Sampling Structure for Texture Classification","sourcePdf":"lsp-pan-2694460-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080617S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"7901503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7901503","articleId":"7902119","onlineDate":"17 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7902124,"authors":[{"name":"Yin Sheng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Image Processing and Intelligent Control of Education Ministry of China, School of Automation, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/8026346/7902124/sheng-2691733-small.gif","p":["Yin Sheng received the M.S. degree with the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2015.

Results have shown that, in many cases, a very high identification accuracy can be obtained by exploiting imperfections and small differences in the electronic components, which are called fingerprints in this context. Part of these studies have focused on a specific category of electronic device, the mobile phone or smartphone, which is usually equipped with components, such as radio frequency frontends, cameras, micro-electro-mechanical systems, microphones, and speakers that are likely to reveal fingerprints in their digital outputs and then allow the identification of the component and of the mobile phone itself. Keeping the focus on mobile phones, this paper provides a survey of the different techniques for mobile phone identification on the basis of their built-in components. This paper describes the methodology, the classification algorithms, and the types of features that are typically used in literature. Outstanding challenges and research issues are also identified and described, together with an overview of the potential applications of mobile phone fingerprinting. In addition, this paper analyzes the potential privacy risks associated to the tracking of the mobile phone on the basis of its fingerprints and the related mitigation techniques. Finally, it summarizes the main issues and identifies research opportunities and potential future trends for mobile phone fingerprinting.","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2017.2694487","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/8013866/07902125.pdf","startPage":"1761","endPage":"1789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8013866","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2017.2694487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey of Techniques for the Identification of Mobile Phones Using the Physical Fingerprints of the Built-In Components","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7902125","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"thirdquarter  2017","displayDocTitle":"A Survey of Techniques for the Identification of Mobile Phones Using the Physical Fingerprints of the Built-In Components","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7902125/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"thirdquarter 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17136511","htmlLink":"/document/7902125/","volume":"19","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2017","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Survey of Techniques for the Identification of Mobile Phones Using the Physical Fingerprints of the Built-In Components","sourcePdf":"comst-baldini-2694487-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.210734S","chronDate":"thirdquarter  2017","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"8013866","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8013866","articleId":"7902125","onlineDate":"17 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7902130,"authors":[{"name":"Jinna Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China","College of Information Engineering, Shenyang University of Chemical Technology, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8038919/7902130/li-2609500-small.gif","p":["Jinna Li (M\u201912) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively.","She is currently an Associate Professor with the Shenyang University of Chemical Technology, Shenyang.

This is accomplished by using the framework of graphical games. In contrast to traditional control protocols, which require complete knowledge of agent dynamics, the proposed off-policy RL algorithm is a model-free approach, in that it solves the optimal synchronization problem without knowing any knowledge of the agent dynamics. A prescribed control policy, called behavior policy, is applied to each agent to generate and collect data for learning. An off-policy Bellman equation is derived for each agent to learn the value function for the policy under evaluation, called target policy, and find an improved policy, simultaneously. Actor and critic neural networks along with least-square approach are employed to approximate target control policies and value functions using the data generated by applying prescribed behavior policies. Finally, an off-policy RL algorithm is presented that is implemented in real time and gives the approximate optimal control policy for each agent using only measured data. It is shown that the optimal distributed policies found by the proposed algorithm satisfy the global Nash equilibrium and synchronize all agents to the leader. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2609500","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/8038919/07902130.pdf","startPage":"2434","endPage":"2445","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2609500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038919","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning for Synchronization in Multiagent Graphical Games","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7902130","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7902130/","displayDocTitle":"Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning for Synchronization in Multiagent Graphical Games","volume":"28","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17189100","pubMedId":"28436891","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7902130/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61673280, 61104093, 61525302, 61333012, 61304028, 61590922 and 61503257"},{"fundingName":"Open Project of State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries","grantNumber":"PAL-N201603"},{"fundingName":"Project of Liaoning Province","grantNumber":"LJQ2015088, 2015020164 and 2014020138"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning for Synchronization in Multiagent Graphical Games","sourcePdf":"tnnls-chai-2609500-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094561S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8038919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"8038919","articleId":"7902130","onlineDate":"17 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7902131,"authors":[{"name":"Danilo Gaspar","affiliation":["Instituto Nacional de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Santa Rita do Sapuca\u00ed, Brazil"],"firstName":"Danilo","lastName":"Gaspar","orcid":"0000-0002-4061-0466","id":"37086036024"},{"name":"Luciano Mendes","affiliation":["Instituto Nacional de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Santa Rita do Sapuca\u00ed, Brazil"],"firstName":"Luciano","lastName":"Mendes","id":"37299801900"},{"name":"Tales Pimenta","affiliation":["Universidade Federal de Itajub\u00e1, Itajub\u00e1, Brazil"],"firstName":"Tales","lastName":"Pimenta","id":"37086036133"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7902131","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1162},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7902131","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Manganese","Bit error rate","Frequency synchronization","Channel estimation","Indexes","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","error statistics","frequency division multiplexing","phase shift keying","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized frequency division multiplexing","GFDM","air interface","fifth generation mobile network","massive machine type communication","residual symbol-time offsets","carrier-frequency offsets","time misalignments","frequency misalignments","bit error rate","synchronization","computational simulation BPSK mapping"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G","IoT","STO","CFO","GFDM","BER"]}],"abstract":"Generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) is a candidate waveform for the air interface of the fifth generation mobile network.

The overall system performance under time and frequency misalignments is crucial in this application scenario.

Apart from exhibiting these good target characteristics, a good design should also be robust, i.e., it should not be very sensitive to slight changes in its design parameters as this would either seriously impact production costs or make the physical machine behave differently than its (optimized) computer simulation model. This paper is focused on describing how global surrogate models (i.e., nonlinear regression models), that are created in order to reduce the dependence on finite-element (FE) simulations during the multi-objective optimization run, can be easily reused to perform very fast local and global tolerance/sensitivity analyses of generated designs. While obtained in a fraction of the time required by the complementary FE-based approach, the surrogate-based sensitivity estimates are able to provide accurate and valuable information regarding the robustness of electrical machine designs. Ultimately, by integrating robustness-related information with Pareto front projections, we aim to provide engineers with much clearer pictures of the specific problem-related tradeoffs discovered by the automated design optimization procedure.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7902141/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2017","isJournal":true,"externalId":"8107611","accessionNumber":"17040465","volume":"53","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7902141/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Surrogate-Based Multi-Objective Optimization of Electrical Machine Designs Facilitating Tolerance Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Surrogate-Based Multi-Objective Optimization of Electrical Machine Designs Facilitating Tolerance Analysis","sourcePdf":"tmag-bramerdorfer-2694802-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126694S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"7983368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7983368","articleId":"7902141","onlineDate":"17 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7902143,"authors":[{"name":"Zi-Peng Wang","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China","School of Electrical Engineering, University of Jinan, Jinan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/8006322/7902143/wang-2690798-small.gif","p":["Zi-Peng Wang received the B.S. degree in mathematics and applied mathematics from Fuyang Normal College, Fuyang, China, in 2010, the M.S. degree in applied mathematics from Guangxi University, Nanning, China, in 2013, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2017.","In 2017, he joined the School of Electrical Engineering, University of Jinan, Jinan, China.

Initially, the nonlinear coupled system is accurately represented by the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy coupled parabolic PDE-ODE model. Then, based on the T-S fuzzy model, a novel time-dependent Lyapunov functional is used to design a sampled-data fuzzy controller such that the closed-loop coupled system is exponentially stable, where the sampled-data fuzzy controller consists of the ODE state feedback and the PDE static output feedback under spatially averaged measurements. The stabilization condition is presented in terms of a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, simulation results on the control of a hypersonic rocket car are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7902143/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7902143/","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17081431","pubMedId":"28436911","volume":"47","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Sampled-Data Fuzzy Control for Nonlinear Coupled Parabolic PDE-ODE Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of China","grantNumber":"61625302"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundations of China","grantNumber":"61473011 and 61421063"},{"fundingName":"GRF Project from RGC of Hong Kong SAR","grantNumber":"CityU 11205615"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampled-Data Fuzzy Control for Nonlinear Coupled Parabolic PDE-ODE Systems","sourcePdf":"tcyb-wang-2690798-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095584S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"8006322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8006322","articleId":"7902143","onlineDate":"17 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":7902151,"authors":[{"name":"Myoungsoo Jung","affiliation":["Yonsei University, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Myoungsoo","lastName":"Jung","orcid":"0000-0002-9832-5801","id":"37085684877"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1556-6056"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1556-6064"},{"format":"CD","value":"2473-2575"}],"articleNumber":"7902151","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":496},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7902151","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase change random access memory","Coprocessors","Computer architecture","Data storage","Network architecture","Data transfer","Field programmable gate arrays","Nonvolatile memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","DRAM chips","field programmable gate arrays","multiprocessing systems","phase change memories","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["powerful research vehicles","data processing","external storage device","redundant memory copies","unnecessary data transfers","host-side resources","additional system context","multicore accelerator","important device parameters","phase change memory chips","multiple processing elements","NearZero","advanced coprocessor approaches","DRAM-less coprocessor architecture","multicore-based coprocessors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Storage devices","hardware architecture","mass storage","memory structures","hybrid systems","multiprocessors","parallel architectures","non-volatile memory","accelerators"]}],"abstract":"Multi-core based coprocessors have become powerful research vehicles to analyze a large amount of data. Even though they can accelerate data processing by using a hundred cores, the data unfortunately exist on an external storage device. The separation of computation and storage introduces redundant memory copies and unnecessary data transfers over different physical device boundaries, which limit the benefits of coprocessor-accelerated data processing. In addition, the coprocessors need assistance from host-side resources to access the external storage, which can require additional system context switches. To address these challenges, we propose NearZero, a novel DRAM-less coprocessor architecture that precisely integrates a state-of-the-art phase change memory into its multi-core accelerator. In this work, we implement an FPGA-based memory controller that extracts important device parameters from real phase change memory chips, and apply them to a commercially available hardware platform that employs multiple processing elements over a PCIe fabric. The evaluation results reveal that NearZero achieves on average 47 percent better performance than advanced coprocessor approaches that use direct I/Os (between storage and coprocessors), while consuming only 19 percent of the total energy of such advanced coprocessors.","doi":"10.1109/LCA.2017.2694828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8240814","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCA.2017.2694828","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Architecture Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Architecture Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/10208/8240814/07902151.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NearZero: An Integration of Phase Change Memory with Multi-Core Coprocessor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"NearZero: An Integration of Phase Change Memory with Multi-Core Coprocessor","volume":"16","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Dec. 1 2017","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7902151/","publicationDate":"1 July-Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17468498","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7902151/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"MemRay","grantNumber":"2015-11-1731"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007431","fundingName":"NRF","grantNumber":"2016R1C1B2015312 and DE-AC02-05CH 11231"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"MSIP","grantNumber":"IITP-2017-2017-0-01015"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NearZero: An Integration of Phase Change Memory with Multi-Core Coprocessor","sourcePdf":"lca-jung-2694828-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037422S","chronDate":"July-Dec. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"10208","isNumber":"8240814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10208","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8240814","articleId":"7902151","onlineDate":"17 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7902152,"authors":[{"name":"Eric Chalmers","affiliation":["Department of Neuroscience, the University of Lethbridge, Lethbridge, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8360119/7902152/chalm-2690910-small.gif","p":["Eric Chalmers received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.","He was a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the Department of Neuroscience, University of Lethbridge, Lethbridge, AB, Canada, where he developed brain-inspired machine learning techniques.

To be capable of efficient, long-term learning, RL agents should be able to apply knowledge gained in the past to new tasks they may encounter in the future. The ability to predict actions' consequences may facilitate such knowledge transfer. We consider here domains where an RL agent has access to two kinds of information: agent-centric information with constant semantics across tasks, and environment-centric information, which is necessary to solve the task, but with semantics that differ between tasks. For example, in robot navigation, environment-centric information may include the robot's geographic location, while agent-centric information may include sensor readings of various nearby obstacles. We propose that these situations provide an opportunity for a very natural style of knowledge transfer, in which the agent learns to predict actions' environmental consequences using agent-centric information. These predictions contain important information about the affordances and dangers present in a novel environment, and can effectively transfer knowledge from agent-centric to environment-centric learning systems. Using several example problems including spatial navigation and network routing, we show that our knowledge transfer approach can allow faster and lower cost learning than existing alternatives.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8360119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2690910","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/8360119/07902152.pdf","startPage":"2259","endPage":"2270","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2690910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Predict Consequences as a Method of Knowledge Transfer in Reinforcement Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Predict Consequences as a Method of Knowledge Transfer in Reinforcement Learning","volume":"29","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7902152/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17766446","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2018","pubMedId":"28436902","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7902152/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"331011712"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Predict Consequences as a Method of Knowledge Transfer in Reinforcement Learning","sourcePdf":"tnnls-chalmers-2690910-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162395S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8360119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8360119","articleId":"7902152","onlineDate":"17 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7902153,"authors":[{"name":"Behnood Rasti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland","Keilir Institute of Technology, Reykjanesb\u00e6r, Iceland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7955031/7902153/rasti-2686450-small.gif","p":["Behnood Rasti (S\u201912\u2013M\u201914) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical and electronics engineering from the University of Guilan, Rasht, Iran, in 2006 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Iceland, Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland, in 2014.","From 2015 to 2016, he was a Post-Doctoral Researcher with the University of Iceland.

We propose to merge the spectral and spatial content of hyperspectral images (HSIs) with elevation information from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) measurements. In this paper, we propose to fuse the data sets using orthogonal total variation component analysis (OTVCA). Extinction profiles are used to automatically extract spatial and elevation information from HSI and rasterized LiDAR features. The extracted spatial and elevation information is then fused with spectral information using the OTVCA-based feature fusion method to produce the final classification map. The extracted features have high dimension, and therefore OTVCA estimates the fused features in a lower dimensional space. OTVCA also promotes piece-wise smoothness while maintaining the spatial structures. Both attributes are important to provide homogeneous regions in the final classification maps. We benchmark the proposed approach (OTVCA-fusion) with an urban data set captured over an urban area in Houston/USA and a rural region acquired in Trento/Italy. In the experiments, OTVCA-fusion is evaluated using random forest and support vector machine classifiers.

Specifically, the measured insertion loss in the on state is less than 1 dB, and the measured input and output return losses are both better than 11.2 dB from 1.9 to 2.6 GHz. The measured output return loss in the off state is better than 15 dB, and the measured isolation is better than 24.7 dB in the same frequency range.

The thickness of the antenna is only 0.2 mm, which can be wrapped inside a capsule's inner wall. By cutting meandered slots on the patch, using open-end slots on the ground, and utilizing two long arms, the proposed antenna obtains a significant size reduction. In the conformal form, the antenna volume measures only 66.7 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n. A single-layer homogeneous muscle phantom box is used for the initial design and optimization with parametric studies. The effect of the internal components inside a capsule is discussed in analyzing the antenna's performance and to realize a more practical scenario. In addition, a realistic human body model in a Remcom XFdtd simulation environment is considered to evaluate the antenna characteristics and CP purity, and to specify the specific absorption rate limit in different organs along the gastrointestinal tract. The performance of the proposed antenna is experimentally validated by using a minced pork muscle phantom and by using an American Society for Testing and Materials phantom immersed in a liquid solution. For measurements, a new technique applying a printed 3-D capsule is devised. From simulations and measurements, we found that the impedance bandwidth of the proposed antenna is more than 20% and with a maximum simulated axial ratio bandwidth of around 29.2% in homogeneous tissue. Finally, a wireless communication link at a data rate of 78 Mb/s is calculated by employing link-budget analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2017.2694700","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7936705/07902165.pdf","startPage":"2816","endPage":"2826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2017.2694700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7936705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Wideband Circularly Polarized Conformal Endoscopic Antenna System for High-Speed Data Transfer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7902165","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7902165/","displayDocTitle":"A Wideband Circularly Polarized Conformal Endoscopic Antenna System for High-Speed Data Transfer","volume":"65","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16917785","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7902165/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology","grantNumber":"2016R1D1A1A09918140"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Wideband Circularly Polarized Conformal Endoscopic Antenna System for High-Speed Data Transfer","sourcePdf":"tap-das-2694700-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066718S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7936705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"7936705","articleId":"7902165","onlineDate":"17 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7902168,"authors":[{"name":"Zuo-Yang Zhong","affiliation":["China Manned Space Agency, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Zuo-Yang Zhong, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Zuo-Yang","lastName":"Zhong","orcid":"0000-0002-8069-6567","id":"38547662500"},{"name":"Jian-Ping Zhou","affiliation":["China Manned Space Agency, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Jian-Ping Zhou, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Jian-Ping","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086043494"},{"name":"Hai-Lian Zhang","affiliation":["China Manned Space Agency, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Hai-Lian Zhang, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Hai-Lian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086039746"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-437X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1748"},{"format":"CD","value":"2379-9153"}],"articleNumber":"7902168","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":205},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Sensors Council","url":"http://www.ieee-sensors.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Sensors","Damping","Heating systems","Microcavities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["composite materials","damping","microcavities","micromechanical resonators","thermodynamics","thermoelasticity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermoelastic damping","functionally graded microbeam resonator","FGM","functionally graded material","TED","inherent energy dissipation","composite beam resonator","monolithic material beam","geometry","thermodynamic property"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Thermoelastic damping","functionally graded materials","microresonator","dynamics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7902168","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2017.2694550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2017.2694550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7920442","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7920442/07902168.pdf","startPage":"3381","endPage":"3390","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermoelastic Damping in Functionally Graded Microbeam Resonators","abstract":"Recently, the functionally graded materials (FGMs) have gained considerable attention.

For experimental verification, a 42-dBm, 2-GHz DPA with OBO of 9.5 dB was designed and fabricated using identical GaN HEMT devices. Under continuous-wave stimulation, measurement results indicate good Doherty behavior can be obtained with 9.5-dB back-off efficiency of 51%-61% and saturation efficiency of 68%-72% over 1.85-2.1 GHz.

An adaptive MIMO-ESO is designed not only to estimate the unmeasurable linear and angular velocities, but also to estimate the unknown external disturbances.

Experimental studies are also carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control, and to show that the proposed approach performs better than a conventional potential difference (PD) control approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extended State Observer-Based Integral Sliding Mode Control for an Underwater Robot With Unknown Disturbances and Uncertain Nonlinearities","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2017.2694410","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7973108/07902170.pdf","startPage":"6785","endPage":"6795","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2017.2694410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7973108","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7902170","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7902170/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Extended State Observer-Based Integral Sliding Mode Control for an Underwater Robot With Unknown Disturbances and Uncertain Nonlinearities","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7902170/","dateOfInsertion":"11 July 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17026509","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61472325 and 51209174"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extended State Observer-Based Integral Sliding Mode Control for an Underwater Robot With Unknown Disturbances and Uncertain Nonlinearities","sourcePdf":"tie-cui-2694410-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131841S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7973108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"7973108","articleId":"7902170","onlineDate":"17 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16","associateArticle":[{"associateType":"ChildErratum","associateDoi":"10.1109/TIE.2018.2868034","associateId":"8456837"}]},{"_id":7902171,"authors":[{"name":"Honggui Han","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Computational Intelligence and Intelligent System, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/8006322/7902171/han-2692385-small.gif","p":["Honggui Han (M\u201910\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.S. degree in automatic from the Civil Aviation University of China, Tianjin, China, in 2005, and the M.E. and Ph.D. degrees from the Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2007 and 2011, respectively.","He has been with the Beijing University of Technology since 2011, where he is currently a Professor.

In this paper, an adaptive MOPSO (AMOPSO) algorithm, based on a hybrid framework of the solution distribution entropy and population spacing (SP) information, is developed to improve the search performance in terms of convergent speed and precision. First, an adaptive global best (gBest) selection mechanism, based on the solution distribution entropy, is introduced to analyze the evolutionary tendency and balance the diversity and convergence of nondominated solutions in the archive. Second, an adaptive flight parameter adjustment mechanism, using the population SP information, is proposed to obtain the distribution of particles with suitable diversity and convergence, which can balance the global exploration and local exploitation abilities of the particles. Third, based on the gBest selection mechanism and the adaptive flight parameter mechanism, this proposed AMOPSO algorithm not only has high accuracy, but also attain a set of optimal solutions with better diversity. Finally, the performance of the proposed AMOPSO algorithm is validated and compared with other five state-of-the-art algorithms on a number of benchmark problems and water distribution system. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed AMOPSO algorithm, as well as demonstrate that AMOPSO outperforms other MOPSO algorithms in solving MOPs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7902171/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17081443","pubMedId":"28436915","htmlLink":"/document/7902171/","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"9","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization Based on Multiple Adaptive Methods","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61622301, 51609258 and 61533002"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4172005"},{"fundingName":"Major National Science and Technology Project","grantNumber":"2017ZX07104"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization Based on Multiple Adaptive Methods","sourcePdf":"tcyb-han-2692385-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124106S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"8006322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8006322","articleId":"7902171","onlineDate":"17 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7902172,"authors":[{"name":"Ibrahim Al-Nahhal","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, Memorial University, St. John\u2019s, NL, Canada"],"firstName":"Ibrahim","lastName":"Al-Nahhal","id":"37085790651"},{"name":"Octavia A.

The key challenge lies in the fact that the optimal solution of a DOP typically changes over time. This paper focuses on using query-based learning dynamic particle swarm optimization (QBLDPSO) to solve DOPs. QBLDPSO is mainly used for improving multi-population-based PSO; our QBL mechanism includes two learning strategies that integrate the concepts of diversity and memory into PSO. The first learning strategy, QBL quantum parameter adaptation (QBLQPA), is used to apply the concept of diversity to the multi-population based algorithm. This is different from typical diversity-based PSO approaches, which passively maintain the diversity of particles in the solution space. We actively adapt the ratio of quantum particles and neutral particles to achieve diversity without analyzing the distribution of optima in the solution space. The second learning strategy is query-based learning optima prediction (QBLOP). Although QBLOP exploits the concept of memory, we do not need to analyze the history of all particles. We select the k nearest particles to the current best solution and use a minimum encompassing circle as the possible prediction region. Our experimental results are based on the generalized dynamic benchmark generator (GDBG), which is adopted as a benchmark for the DOP. The proposed method outperforms two state-of-the-art multi-population-based PSO methods with the average improvements of 11.37% and 8% using QBLQPA. In particular, for the recurrent problems in GDBG, our method improves performance by 35.06%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7902185/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2017","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"16904560","htmlLink":"/document/7902185/","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Query-Based Learning for Dynamic Particle Swarm Optimization","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Academia Sinica Digital Center: System Management and Content Retrieval Technologies for supporting Cloud-based Digital Archive Systems and Services Projects through the Academia Sinica and the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"105-2410-H-002-099-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Query-Based Learning for Dynamic Particle Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"access-hsu-2694843-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091911S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7902185","onlineDate":"17 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7902191,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Sun","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8006337/7902191/sun-2694353-small.gif","p":["Hao Sun received the B.S. degree in communication engineering in 2014\n from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, where he is currently working toward the M.S. degree in modern signal\n processing.","His research interests include electronic noses and intelligent algorithms."]},"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Sun","id":"37086192600"},{"name":"Fengchun Tian","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8006337/7902191/tian-2694353-small.gif","p":["Fengchun Tian received the B.S. degree in wireless communication, the\n M.S. degree in biomedical instrumentation, and the Ph.D. degree in theoretical electrotechnics from Chongqing\n University, Chongqing, China, in 1984, 1989, and 1996, respectively.","He is currently a Professor in the College of Communication Engineering, Chongqing University.

Conventionally, the NN model is estimated from a set of one-way observations. Such a vectorized NN is not generalized for learning the representation from multiway observations. The classification performance using vectorized NN is constrained, because the temporal or spatial information in neighboring ways is disregarded. More parameters are required to learn the complicated data structure. This paper presents a new tensor-factorized NN (TFNN), which tightly integrates TF and NN for multiway feature extraction and classification under a unified discriminative objective. This TFNN is seen as a generalized NN, where the affine transformation in an NN is replaced by the multilinear and multiway factorization for tensor-based NN. The multiway information is preserved through layerwise factorization. Tucker decomposition and nonlinear activation are performed in each hidden layer. The tensor-factorized error backpropagation is developed to train TFNN with the limited parameter size and computation time. This TFNN can be further extended to realize the convolutional TFNN (CTFNN) by looking at small subtensors through the factorized convolution. Experiments on real-world classification tasks demonstrate that TFNN and CTFNN attain substantial improvement when compared with an NN and a convolutional NN, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2690379","startPage":"1998","endPage":"2011","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2690379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8338465","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/8338465/07902201.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tensor-factorized neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7902201/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Tensor-factorized neural networks","volume":"29","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7902201/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17716473","pubMedId":"28436897","publicationDate":"May 2018","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 105-2221-E-009-137-MY2"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tensor-factorized neural networks","sourcePdf":"tnnls-chien-2690379-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114603S","chronDate":"May  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8338465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8338465","articleId":"7902201","onlineDate":"17 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7902202,"authors":[{"name":"Huanqing Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Bohai University, Jinzhou, China","Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada","School of Mechanical, Electronic and Control Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/8327949/7902202/wang-2694799-small.gif","p":["Huanqing Wang received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics from Bohai University, Jinzhou, China, in 2003, the M.Sc. degree in mathematics from Inner Mongolia University, Huhhot, China, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Complexity Science, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China, in 2013.","In 2014, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Electrical Engineering, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada.

Large amplitudes at terminal voltages of these transistors push them into different regions of operation. In this paper, harmonic translations are derived as a result of such changes in operation region of transistors. Operation in triode region for a portion of oscillation cycle results in iterative harmonic translations between fundamental frequency and second harmonic. They boost each other constructively for significantly stronger oscillation, more second harmonic output power, and enhanced dc-to-RF efficiency. Based on this analysis, a 215-GHz signal source, implemented in a TSMC 65-nm CMOS LP is presented. The proposed oscillator achieves a maximum output power of 5.6 dBm and a dc-to-RF efficiency of 4.6%. The measured phase noise is -94.6 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset.

They are used in our homes, in hospitals, deployed outside to control and report the changes in environment, prevent fires, and many more beneficial functionality. However, all those benefits can come of huge risks of privacy loss and security issues. To secure the IoT devices, many research works have been conducted to countermeasure those problems and find a better way to eliminate those risks, or at least minimize their effects on the user's privacy and security requirements. The survey consists of four segments. The first segment will explore the most relevant limitations of IoT devices and their solutions. The second one will present the classification of IoT attacks. The next segment will focus on the mechanisms and architectures for authentication and access control. The last segment will analyze the security issues in different layers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7902207/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","volume":"4","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"17281982","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7902207/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Survey on Security and Privacy Issues in Internet-of-Things","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61502116"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey on Security and Privacy Issues in Internet-of-Things","sourcePdf":"jiot-li-2694844-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107138S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8059894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"219","xplore-issue":"8059894","articleId":"7902207","onlineDate":"17 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7902210,"authors":[{"name":"Luka Peternel","affiliation":["Humanoid Design and Human Centered Mechatronics Lab, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genova, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7333/8000746/7902210/peter-2694553-small.gif","p":["Luka Peternel received the Ph.D. degree in robotics from the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia, in 2015.

Unlike active localization techniques, it does not require for users to carry measuring devices, e.g., smart phones. Thus, it is widely used in applications such as security, smart housing, object tracking, etc. However, in real-world applications, the passive localization accuracy is limited due to the environment noises, multipath effect, etc. To address those problems, in this paper, we propose to use channel state information (CSI) instead. Specifically, we make the following contributions: 1) we design a CSI-based passive indoor localization system; 2) we develop a Naive Bayes classifier enhanced with confidence level information; and 3) we demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique using real-world deployments. The experimental results show that our technique can achieve more than 86% accuracy on average and at least 15% better than the baseline Naive Bayes classifier.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2017.2679725","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/8438341/07902212.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2017.2679725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8438341","startPage":"1566","endPage":"1577","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Passive Indoor Localization Based on CSI and Naive Bayes Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7902212","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Passive Indoor Localization Based on CSI and Naive Bayes Classification","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7902212/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18023106","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7902212/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572439, 61273212 and 11505153"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province","grantNumber":"LY18F030021, LY18F010025 and LQ15A050002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passive Indoor Localization Based on CSI and Naive Bayes Classification","sourcePdf":"tsmc-xiang-2679725-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093694S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"8438341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"8438341","articleId":"7902212","onlineDate":"17 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":7902216,"authors":[{"name":"Ben Niu","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Physics, Bohai University, Jinzhou, China","College of Control Science and Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Niu","orcid":"0000-0002-3680-5594","id":"37086376449"},{"name":"Lu Li","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Physics, Bohai University, Jinzhou, China","College of Control Science and Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Li","id":"37085624312"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-237X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2388"}],"articleNumber":"7902216","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1085},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Adaptive systems","Nonlinear systems","MIMO","Artificial neural networks","Switched systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","control nonlinearities","control system synthesis","delays","Lyapunov methods","MIMO systems","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","radial basis function networks","switching systems (control)","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive backstepping","neural tracking control","neural-network","radial basis function NNs","mass-spring-damper system","multiple-input multiple-output","multiple Lyapunov function","controller design method","coordinate transformations","MIMO nonlinear switched systems","closed-loop system","uncertain nonlinear switched system","input delays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive control","input delay","neural network (NN)","switched multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems"]}],"abstract":"This brief proposes a new neural-network (NN)-based adaptive output tracking control scheme for a class of disturbed multiple-input multiple-output uncertain nonlinear switched systems with input delays. By combining the universal approximation ability of radial basis function NNs and adaptive backstepping recursive design with an improved multiple Lyapunov function (MLF) scheme, a novel adaptive neural output tracking controller design method is presented for the switched system. The feature of the developed design is that different coordinate transformations are adopted to overcome the conservativeness caused by adopting a common coordinate transformation for all subsystems. It is shown that all the variables of the resulting closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded under a class of switching signals in the presence of MLF and that the system output can follow the desired reference signal.

The proposed model utilizes a regime switching process to describe the evolution of the solar radiance time series. The optimal number of regimes and regime-specific parameters are determined by the Bayesian inference. The Markov regime switching model provides both the point and interval prediction of solar radiance based on the posterior distribution derived from historical data by the Bayesian inference. Four solar radiance forecasting models, the persistence model, the autoregressive (AR) model, the Gaussian process regression (GPR) model, and the neural network (NN) model, are considered as baseline models for validating the Markov switching model. The comparative analysis based on numerical experiment results demonstrates that in general the Markov regime switching model performs better than compared models in the day-ahead point and interval prediction of the solar radiance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7902217/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7902217/","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17192744","volume":"8","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Day-Ahead Prediction of Bihourly Solar Radiance With a Markov Switch Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Day-Ahead Prediction of Bihourly Solar Radiance With a Markov Switch Approach","sourcePdf":"tste-zhang-2694551-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100119S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5165391","isNumber":"8045832","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8045832","articleId":"7902217","onlineDate":"17 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7902234,"authors":[{"name":"Jialei Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Anyang Institute of Technology, Anyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4629386/9114375/7902234/liu-2694838-small.gif","p":["Jialei Liu received the ME degree in computer science and technology from Henan Polytechnic University, in 2008.

The VMs of a virtual cluster (VC) must be allocated as compactly as possible to avoid bandwidth-related bottlenecks. Since each PM/switch has a certain failure probability, a VC may not be executed when it meets with any PM/switch fault. Although the VMs of a VC can be spread out across different fault domains to minimize the risk of violating the availability requirement of the VC, this increases the network core traffic. Therefore, avoiding the decrease in availability caused by the heterogeneous PM/switch failure probabilities and bandwidth-related bottlenecks has been a constant challenge. In this paper, we first introduce a joint optimization function to measure the overall risk cost and overall bandwidth usage in the network core to allocate the same set of data-intensive applications. We then introduce an approach to maximize the value of the joint optimization function. Finally, we performed a side-by-side comparison with prior algorithms, and the experimental results show that our approach outperforms the other existing algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2017.2694838","startPage":"425","endPage":"436","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4629386/9114375/07902234.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2017.2694838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9114375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Availability-Aware Virtual Cluster Allocation in Bandwidth-Constrained Datacenters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Switches","Cloud computing","Resource management","Optimization","Maintenance engineering","Load modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","cloud computing","computer centres","minimisation","probability","risk analysis","virtual machines","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous PM-switch failure probability","virtual cluster","virtual machines","risk minimization","big data","availability-aware virtual cluster allocation","data-intensive applications","bandwidth usage","joint optimization function","availability requirement","fault domains","bandwidth-related bottlenecks","network core traffic","heterogeneous physical machines","bandwidth-constrained datacenters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bandwidth-constrained datacenter","virtual cluster","availability","bandwidth-related bottleneck","risk","fault domain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7902234/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June 1 2020","displayDocTitle":"Availability-Aware Virtual Cluster Allocation in Bandwidth-Constrained Datacenters","volume":"13","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7902234/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 May-June 2020","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2020","accessionNumber":"19686865","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61472047 and 61602054"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality","grantNumber":"4174100"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Availability-Aware Virtual Cluster Allocation in Bandwidth-Constrained Datacenters","sourcePdf":"tsc-liu-2694838-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12981S","chronDate":"May-June 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"9114375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"9114375","articleId":"7902234","onlineDate":"17 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7902237,"authors":[{"name":"Zhichao Sheng","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China","Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8067706/7902237/sheng-2694821-small.gif","p":["Zhichao Sheng was born in Yangzhou, China.

For an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system operating in a high-mobility environment such as in high-speed trains, a sequence of pilot samples is inserted in each OFDM symbol to track the fast-varying channel responses. For such a high-mobility environment, the design of pilot sequence to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of the channel estimate under a linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimator poses a difficult polynomial fractional optimization problem. In this paper, we develop a path-following optimization procedure, which improves the MSE in every iteration and quickly converges at least to its locally-optimal solution. Each iterative solution is given in a closed form with very low computational complexity. The developed path-following procedure can also be adapted to design pilot sequences for the least-square and maximum-likelihood estimators.

The main problem is that shape-preserving beams can be steered only in a finite set of privileged directions, which depend on the position and the number of physical microphones. In this letter, we propose a simple and computationally inexpensive method for alleviating this problem using planar microphone arrays. Given two identical reference beams pointing in two different directions, we show how to build a beam of nearly constant shape, which can be continuously steered between such two directions. The proposed method, unlike the diffused steering approaches based on linear combinations of eigenbeams (spherical harmonics), is applicable to planar arrays also if we deal with beams characterized by high-order polar patterns. Using the coefficients of the Fourier series of the polar patterns, we also show how to find a tradeoff between shape invariance of the steered beam, and maximum angular displacement between the two reference beams. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method through the analysis of models based on first-, second-, and third-order differential microphones.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2017.2695082","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/7901503/07903573.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7901503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2017.2695082","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","startPage":"794","endPage":"798","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Continuous Beam Steering for Planar Arrays of Differential Microphones","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7903573","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Continuous Beam Steering for Planar Arrays of Differential Microphones","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903573/","volume":"24","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7903573/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16835087","dateOfInsertion":"27 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Continuous Beam Steering for Planar Arrays of Differential Microphones","sourcePdf":"lsp-bernardini-2695082-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141812S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"7901503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7901503","articleId":"7903573","onlineDate":"18 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7903576,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Kwisanga","affiliation":["College of Science and Technology, University of Rwanda, Kigali, Rwanda"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Kwisanga","orcid":"0000-0002-3541-1542","id":"37086082259"},{"name":"Coenrad J.

To provide a comprehensive overview, we not only categorize existing dictionary learning algorithms for face recognition but also present details of each category. Since the number of atoms has an important impact on classification performance, we also review the algorithms for selecting the number of atoms. Specifically, we select six typical dictionary learning algorithms with different numbers of atoms to perform experiments on face databases. In summary, this paper provides a broad view of dictionary learning algorithms for face recognition and advances study in this field. It is very useful for readers to understand the profiles of this subject and to grasp the theoretical rationales and potentials as well as their applicability to different cases of face recognition.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey of Dictionary Learning Algorithms for Face Recognition","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2695239","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07903603.pdf","startPage":"8502","endPage":"8514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2695239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7903603","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903603/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","displayDocTitle":"A Survey of Dictionary Learning Algorithms for Face Recognition","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7903603/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"16904708","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Council for Scientific and Technological Innovation","grantNumber":"JCYJ2015033015522059"},{"fundingName":"Foundation for Young Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong","grantNumber":"2015KQNCX08"},{"fundingName":"Open Fund Project of Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing and Intelligent Control, Minjiang University","grantNumber":"MJUKF201720"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Survey of Dictionary Learning Algorithms for Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"access-li-2695239-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154798S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7903603","onlineDate":"18 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7903608,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed Alawad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687315/8320448/7903608/alawa-2695588-small.gif","p":["Mohammed Alawad received the BSc and MSc degrees in computer\n engineering from the University of Mosul, Iraq, in 2007 and 2009, respectively, and the PhD degree in computer\n engineering from the University of Central Florida, in 2016.

This performance bottleneck is especially acute for embedded image or video applications, that use 2-D FIR processing extensively, because real-time processing and low power consumption are their paramount design objectives. Fortunately, most of such perception-based embedded applications possess so-called \u201cinherent fault tolerance\u201d, meaning slight computing accuracy degradation has a little negative effect on their quality of results, but has significant implication to their throughput, hardware implementation cost, and energy efficiency. This paper develops a novel stochastic-based 2-D FIR filtering architecture that exploits the well-known probabilistic convolution theorem to achieve both low hardware cost and high energy efficiency while achieving very high throughput and computing robustness. Our ASIC synthesis results show that stochastic-based architecture achieves L outputs per cycle with 97 and 81 percent less area-delay-product (ADP), and 77 and 67 percent less power consumption compared with the conventional structure and recently published state-of-the-art architecture, respectively, when the 2-D FIR filter size is 4 \u00d7 4, the input block size is L 1/4 4, and the image size is 512 \u00d7 512.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687315/8320448/07903608.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"82","doi":"10.1109/TMSCS.2017.2695588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMSCS.2017.2695588","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8320448","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memory-Efficient Probabilistic 2-D Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Filter","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6687315/8320448/7903608-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903608/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March 1 2018","displayDocTitle":"Memory-Efficient Probabilistic 2-D Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Filter","htmlLink":"/document/7903608/","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-March 2018","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2018","accessionNumber":"17650964","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ARO DURIP","grantNumber":"N16-22-6056"},{"fundingName":"US National Science Foundation BRIGE","grantNumber":"ECCS-1342225"},{"fundingName":"US National Science Foundation CCF","grantNumber":"1319884"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Memory-Efficient Probabilistic 2-D Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Filter","sourcePdf":"tmscs-alawad-2695588-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.164607S","chronDate":"Jan.-March 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"6687315","isNumber":"8320448","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687315","xplore-issue":"8320448","articleId":"7903608","onlineDate":"18 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7903610,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Xi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Xi","orcid":"0000-0001-7580-6648","id":"37085644570"},{"name":"Qingjiang Shi","affiliation":["Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qingjiang","lastName":"Shi","id":"38268234200"},{"name":"Chen He","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"He","id":"37085336471"},{"name":"Lingge Jiang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Lingge","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37272131100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"7903610","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":510},"abstract":"A user equipment (UE) beamforming method is proposed in this letter for massive MIMO systems with multi-antenna UEs.

The sensor is fabricated by femtosecond laser in a single-mode fiber. A cylindrical cavity is micromachined in the fiber cladding and partly in the fiber core, forming an interferometric structure. We have found that when the spectral response of the structure to RI is considered, a periodic pattern is observed and the sensitivity highly increases with RI and reaches over 23 000 nm/RIU within the RI range of 1.4200-1.4400 RIU. Moreover, during the measurement of cavities with diameters in the order of tens of micrometers, we found the cavity-filling process to be both difficult and time-consuming, especially when high-RI liquids are being investigated. We therefore applied reactive ion etching in oxygen plasma, which significantly changed the wettability of the cavity's surface and enabled fast cavity filling with any investigated liquid. Due to its ultra-high sensitivity and capability for investigating sub-nanoliter volumes of liquids, the sensor could be well suited for chemical and bio-sensing applications.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2017.2695544","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7920442/07903613.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2017.2695544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7920442","startPage":"3316","endPage":"3322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensitivity Pattern of Femtosecond Laser Micromachined and Plasma-Processed In-Fiber Mach-Zehnder Interferometers, as Applied to Small-Scale Refractive Index Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7903613","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity Pattern of Femtosecond Laser Micromachined and Plasma-Processed In-Fiber Mach-Zehnder Interferometers, as Applied to Small-Scale Refractive Index Sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"June1, 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903613/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"11","publicationDate":"1 June1, 2017","accessionNumber":"16880681","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7903613/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004281","fundingName":"National Science Centre, Poland","grantNumber":"2014/13/B/ST7/01742"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001804","fundingName":"Canada Research Chairs Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Strategic, Discovery and Industrial Research Grant Programs)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity Pattern of Femtosecond Laser Micromachined and Plasma-Processed In-Fiber Mach-Zehnder Interferometers, as Applied to Small-Scale Refractive Index Sensing","sourcePdf":"jsen-janik-2695544-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151676S","chronDate":"June1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7920442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7920442","articleId":"7903613","onlineDate":"18 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7903616,"authors":[{"name":"Michael J.

Early commodity graphics hardware was largely based on fixed-function components offering little flexibility. The gradual replacement of fixed-function hardware with more general-purpose instruction processors, has enabled GPUs to deliver visual experiences more tailored to specific applications. This trend has culminated in modern GPUs essentially being programmable stream processors, capable of supporting a wide variety of applications in and outside of computer graphics. However, the growing concern of power efficiency in modern processors, coupled with an increasing demand for supporting next-generation graphics pipelines, has re-invigorated the debate on the use of fixed-function accelerators in these platforms. In this paper, we conduct a study of a heterogeneous, system-on-chip solution for the construction of a highly important data structure for computer graphics: the bounding volume hierarchy. This design incorporates conventional CPU cores alongside a fixed-function accelerator prototyped on a reconfigurable logic fabric. Our study supports earlier, simulation-only studies which argue for the introduction of this class of accelerator in future graphics processors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of a BVH Construction Accelerator Architecture for High-Quality Visualization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","doi":"10.1109/TMSCS.2017.2695338","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687315/8320448/07903616.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMSCS.2017.2695338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8320448","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7903616","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903616/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March 1 2018","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of a BVH Construction Accelerator Architecture for High-Quality Visualization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7903616/","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2018","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-March 2018","accessionNumber":"17650965","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)","grantNumber":"13/IA/1895"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of a BVH Construction Accelerator Architecture for High-Quality Visualization","sourcePdf":"tmscs-doyle-2695338-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118875S","chronDate":"Jan.-March 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"6687315","isNumber":"8320448","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687315","xplore-issue":"8320448","articleId":"7903616","onlineDate":"18 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7903619,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Zhang","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"p":["Tao Zhang is currently a Ph.D. student at Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, P.

Specifically, a multiband linear time-invariant Gaussian channel under universal sub-Nyquist sampling is considered. The entire channel bandwidth is divided into n subbands of equal bandwidth. At each time, only k constant-gain subbands are active, where the instantaneous subband occupancy is not known at the receiver and the sampler. We study the information loss through an information , that is, the gap of achievable rates caused by the lack of instantaneous subband occupancy information. We characterize the minimax information rate loss for the sub-Nyquist regime, provided that the number n of subbands and the SNR are both large. The minimax limits depend almost solely on the band sparsity factor and the undersampling factor, modulo some residual terms that vanish as n and SNR grow. Our results highlight the power of randomized sampling methods (i.e., the samplers that consist of random periodic modulation and low-pass filters), which are able to approach the minimax information rate loss with exponentially high probability.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/18/7931776/7903620-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903620/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7903620/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16898612","volume":"63","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Minimax Capacity Loss Under Sub-Nyquist Universal Sampling","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-0939370 and CIS-1320628"},{"fundingName":"AFOSR through MURI","grantNumber":"FA9550-12-1-0215"},{"fundingName":"BSF Transformative Science","grantNumber":"2010505"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"On the Minimax Capacity Loss Under Sub-Nyquist Universal Sampling","sourcePdf":"tit-chen-2695541-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09702S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7931776","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7931776","articleId":"7903620","onlineDate":"18 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7903622,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Cui","affiliation":["Advanced Launching Co-innovation Center, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Ke Cui received the B.E. degree and Ph.D. degree in optical information science and technology and physical electronics from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2008 and 2014, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a novel unified PCG signal delineation and murmur classification method without the use of reference signal for automatic detection and classification of heart sounds and murmurs. The major components of the proposed method are the empirical wavelet transform-based PCG signal decomposition for discriminating heart sounds from heart murmurs and suppressing background noises, the Shannon entropy envelope extraction, the instantaneous phase-based boundary determination, heart sound and murmur parameter extraction, the systole/diastole discrimination and the decision rules-based murmur classification. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed method is evaluated using a wide variety of normal and abnormal PCG signals taken from the standard PCG databases, including PASCAL heart sounds challenge database, PhysioNet/CinC challenge heart sound database, and real-time PCG signals. Evaluation results show that the proposed method achieves an average sensitivity (Se) of 94.38%, positive predictivity (Pp) of 97.25%, and overall accuracy (OA) of 91.92% for heart sound segmentation and Se of 97.58%, Pp of 96.46%, and OA of 94.21% in detecting the presence of heart murmurs for SNR of 10 dB. The method yields an average classification accuracy of 95.5% for the PCG signals with SNR of 20 dB. Results show that the proposed method outperforms other existing heart sound segmentation and murmur classification methods.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2017.2694970","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7932554/07903626.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2017.2694970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7932554","startPage":"3861","endPage":"3872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective Heart Sound Segmentation and Murmur Classification Using Empirical Wavelet Transform and Instantaneous Phase for Electronic Stethoscope","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7903626","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effective Heart Sound Segmentation and Murmur Classification Using Empirical Wavelet Transform and Instantaneous Phase for Electronic Stethoscope","chronOrPublicationDate":"June15, 15 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903626/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"12","publicationDate":"15 June15, 2017","accessionNumber":"16899166","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7903626/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective Heart Sound Segmentation and Murmur Classification Using Empirical Wavelet Transform and Instantaneous Phase for Electronic Stethoscope","sourcePdf":"jsen-v-2694970-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156391S","chronDate":"June15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7932554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"7932554","articleId":"7903626","onlineDate":"18 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7903627,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Sun","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies Lab, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7903627/sun-2694863-small.gif","p":["Yang Sun was born in Shandong, China, in 1988.

However, in the ultra dense network, frequent data plane handovers would still introduce huge signaling exchanges and latencies. In this paper, we propose a universal predictive mobility management scheme for urban ultra-dense networks to speed up the data plane handover process. We utilize the probability suffix tree model to save and analyze the transition relationships between small cells in terms of variable markov chains, and pre-configure a cluster of small cells with larger handover probabilities for the users. To accommodate different versions of the users, a compatible network-controlled predictive mobility management procedure and an advanced user-autonomous predictive mobility management procedure are proposed to support the proposed predictive mobility management scheme. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the prediction accuracy with a lower redundant configuration cost and can effectively speed up the data plane handover process compared with the traditional mobility management.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2694863","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07903627.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2694863","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","startPage":"6015","endPage":"6026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Universal Predictive Mobility Management Scheme for Urban Ultra-Dense Networks With Control/Data Plane Separation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7903627","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Universal Predictive Mobility Management Scheme for Urban Ultra-Dense Networks With Control/Data Plane Separation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903627/","volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7903627/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"16870772","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Universal Predictive Mobility Management Scheme for Urban Ultra-Dense Networks With Control/Data Plane Separation","sourcePdf":"access-sun-2694863-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103819S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7903627","onlineDate":"18 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7903628,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed A.

The model considered is the simplest primitive that embodies a multi-transmitter multi-receiver network that needs to communicate sharing an untrusted relay node. We focus on two scenarios. In the first scenario, each source aims to send two messages to be kept secret from the relay: a common message that should be decoded by both destinations, and a private message that should be decoded by the first destination while kept secret from the second one. We define an achievable rate region by utilizing stochastic encoding at the sources, the Gaussian noise cooperative jamming from the destinations, and compress-and-forward at the relay. In the second scenario, each source aims to send a confidential message to its intended destination, which should be kept secret from the other one as well as the relay. We define an achievable rate region using a combination of nested lattice codes and random binning at the sources, structured cooperative jamming from destinations, and scaled compute-and-forward at the relay. We also derive genie-aided outer bounds on the secrecy rate regions. We present numerical results that demonstrate the performance of the proposed achievable schemes. Overall, this paper provides insights into how to utilize an untrusted relay to communicate to destinations with different levels of security clearance, and how intentional interference is an enabler of communication.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Terminal Two-Hop Untrusted-Relay Networks With Hierarchical Security Guarantees","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2017.2695163","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7948894/07903628.pdf","startPage":"2052","endPage":"2066","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2017.2695163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7948894","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7903628","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/10206/7948894/7903628-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903628/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Terminal Two-Hop Untrusted-Relay Networks With Hierarchical Security Guarantees","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7903628/","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"16962013","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF 13-19338 and CNS 13-14719"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Multi-Terminal Two-Hop Untrusted-Relay Networks With Hierarchical Security Guarantees","sourcePdf":"tifs-zewail-2695163-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102662S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7948894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7948894","articleId":"7903628","onlineDate":"18 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7903633,"authors":[{"name":"Harsh Tataria","affiliation":["School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Queen\u2019s University Belfast, Belfast, U.K.","School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7979727/7903633/tatar-2695199-small.gif","p":["Harsh Tataria (S\u201913) received the B.E. degree (Hons) in electronic engineering from the Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand, in 2013, and the Ph.D. degree from the Wireless Communications Research Group, Victoria University of Wellington, in 2017.

An application to two-tier small-cell networks is considered, assuming independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and semi-correlated Rayleigh fading channels, with spatial correlation at the base station. Our analysis caters for equal and unequal correlation matrices for each terminal. For the i.i.d. case and when each terminal is assigned an equal correlation matrix, our expressions are averaged over the eigenvalue densities of the channel correlation matrices, which follow an uncorrelated and correlated complex central Wishart distribution. With unequal correlation matrices, we exploit the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) convergence of RZF precoding to zero-forcing (ZF) precoding and use a second-order Neumann series expansion to derive closed-form approximations to the expected RZF SINR and ergodic sum spectral efficiency, via the expected ZF SNR and ergodic sum spectral efficiency. Our numerical results show the adverse effects of intercellular interference, along with the improvements in the above-mentioned performance metrics with network-wide coordination over cell-wide and macro-only coordination strategies. The derived expressions are robust to changes in system dimensions, operating SNRs, and correlation levels.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2695199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7979727","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2695199","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7979727/07903633.pdf","startPage":"3133","endPage":"3150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the General Analysis of Coordinated Regularized Zero-Forcing Precoding: An Application to Two-Tier Small-Cell Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"On the General Analysis of Coordinated Regularized Zero-Forcing Precoding: An Application to Two-Tier Small-Cell Networks","volume":"65","issue":"7","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7903633/","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17026932","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903633/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the General Analysis of Coordinated Regularized Zero-Forcing Precoding: An Application to Two-Tier Small-Cell Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-tataria-2695199-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.190869S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7979727","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7979727","articleId":"7903633","onlineDate":"18 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7903635,"authors":[{"name":"Abdullah G.

Due to the lack of real solid-state memristive devices, there have been many initiatives to develop memristor emulators to study their behavior and applications. One of the most widely used ideal memristor models developed by the HP Lab does not fit the anticipated nonlinear behaviors of a real memristor. In this paper, we propose the concept and the design of a practical memristor emulator, which can be used to mimic the behavior of the well-known current controlled memristor models like-Simmons tunneling barrier model and the ThrEshold adaptive memristor model. Our proposed emulator model mimics the behavior of the electrical nonlinearity of the fabricated memristor. Prior emulators can only emulate the linear electrical behavior. In addition to the mathematical modeling and analysis of the proposed emulator, we provide SPICE simulation and experimental results. Furthermore, the proposed emulator has been used to verify some applications like Wien Oscillators. Finally, a brief comparison with the previously published emulators is presented to highlight the advantages of the proposed design.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2695402","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2695402","startPage":"5399","endPage":"5409","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07903635.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrical Nonlinearity Emulation Technique for Current-Controlled Memristive Devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903635/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Electrical Nonlinearity Emulation Technique for Current-Controlled Memristive Devices","volume":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2017","accessionNumber":"16950339","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","htmlLink":"/document/7903635/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007614","fundingName":"Al Jouf University Grant"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Electrical Nonlinearity Emulation Technique for Current-Controlled Memristive Devices","sourcePdf":"access-alharbi-2695402-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148479S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7903635","onlineDate":"18 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7903636,"authors":[{"name":"Yading Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Radiation Oncology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yading","lastName":"Yuan","orcid":"0000-0002-4483-6702","id":"37086019944"},{"name":"Ming Chao","affiliation":["Department of Radiation Oncology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Chao","id":"37086017673"},{"name":"Yeh-Chi Lo","affiliation":["Department of Radiation Oncology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yeh-Chi","lastName":"Lo","id":"37086029859"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0062"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-254X"}],"articleNumber":"7903636","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":69,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5002},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Skin","Lesions","Malignant tumors","Databases","Biomedical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical optical imaging","cancer","convolution","endoscopes","entropy","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing","neural nets","skin","tumours"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic skin lesion segmentation","deep fully convolutional neural networks","Jaccard distance","dermoscopic images","fuzzy lesion borders","deep learning efficiency","cross entropy","melanoma detection challenge"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep learning","fully convolutional neural networks","image segmentation","jaccard distance","melanoma","dermoscopy"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artifacts","Dermoscopy","Humans","Melanoma","Neural Networks (Computer)","Skin"]}],"abstract":"Automatic skin lesion segmentation in dermoscopic images is a challenging task due to the low contrast between lesion and the surrounding skin, the irregular and fuzzy lesion borders, the existence of various artifacts, and various imaging acquisition conditions. In this paper, we present a fully automatic method for skin lesion segmentation by leveraging 19-layer deep convolutional neural networks that is trained end-to-end and does not rely on prior knowledge of the data. We propose a set of strategies to ensure effective and efficient learning with limited training data. Furthermore, we design a novel loss function based on Jaccard distance to eliminate the need of sample re-weighting, a typical procedure when using cross entropy as the loss function for image segmentation due to the strong imbalance between the number of foreground and background pixels. We evaluated the effectiveness, efficiency, as well as the generalization capability of the proposed framework on two publicly available databases.

Experimental results showed that the proposed method outperformed other state-of-the-art algorithms on these two databases.

However, the performance of the LINC signal separation and power combining procedures decreases with the rise of the signal's peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). A new ring-type magnitude modulation (RMM) method is proposed for OQPSK signals that limits both its maximum and minimum complex envelope excursions avoiding zero crossings, without spreading the transmitted signal's spectrum. The performance results show that band-limited OQPSK signals whose envelope has low fluctuations produce LINC components with a narrower spectrum, with a considerable impact on the LINC transmitter regardless of the type of combiner chosen: when using a passive/matched combiner, the transmitter's power efficiency is significantly increased without spreading the combined signal's spectrum; for the highly efficient non-linear Chireix combiner, there is a reduction of the amount of spectral leakage produced by nonlinearly combining the LINC signal components. Finally, an iterative decoding scheme is also proposed, which employs estimates of the received symbols' RMM coefficients to compensate the RMM distortion.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903638/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","volume":"65","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"17099654","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7903638/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Ring-Type Magnitude Modulation for LINC: A Pragmatic Approach to the Efficiency Challenge","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001871","fundingName":"FCT/MEC through national funds and when applicable co-funded by FEDER-PT2020 partnership agreement","grantNumber":"UID/EEA/50008/2013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ring-Type Magnitude Modulation for LINC: A Pragmatic Approach to the Efficiency Challenge","sourcePdf":"tcomm-gomes-2695602-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.195118S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8010491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8010491","articleId":"7903638","onlineDate":"18 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":7903642,"authors":[{"name":"Qingyun Yan","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, Memorial University, St. John's, NL, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/8007358/7903642/yan-2689009-small.gif","p":["Qingyun Yan (S\u201914) was born in Haimen, China.

In the training phase, DDM pixels were employed as an input.

After the training process using a dataset collected around February 4, 2015, these networks were used to produce corresponding detection and concentration estimation for other four sets of DDM data, which were collected around February 12, 2015, February 20, 2015, March 16, 2015, and April 17, 2015, respectively. Results show high accuracy in sea ice detection and concentration estimation with DDMs using the proposed scheme. On average, the accuracy for sea ice detection is about 98.4%. In terms of estimated SIC, the mean absolute error is less than 9%, whereas the correlation coefficient is as high as 0.93 compared with the reference data. It was also found that low sea state and wind speed could lead to an overestimation of SIC for partially ice-covered region.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2689009","startPage":"3789","endPage":"3798","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2689009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8007358","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/8007358/07903642.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Networks Based Sea Ice Detection and Concentration Retrieval From GNSS-R Delay-Doppler Maps","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903642/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural Networks Based Sea Ice Detection and Concentration Retrieval From GNSS-R Delay-Doppler Maps","volume":"10","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7903642/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17135958","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"NSERC 402313-2012"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Networks Based Sea Ice Detection and Concentration Retrieval From GNSS-R Delay-Doppler Maps","sourcePdf":"jstars-huang-2689009-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126098S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"8007358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8007358","articleId":"7903642","onlineDate":"18 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7903650,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Akbari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7903650/akbar-2693342-small.gif","p":["Mohammad Akbari (S\u201915) received the B.Sc. degree in engineering-telecommunication from the University of Shahid Bahonar, Kerman, Iran, in 2007, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering-telecommunication from the University of Urmia, Urmia, Iran, in 2011.

This is obtained by incorporating a two-layer transmission-type frequency selective surface (FSS) superstrate based on planar crossed-dipole metal strips. This paper presents a comparison between the mutual coupling when the patches are radiating in free space and in the presence of the FSS layers. The simulated results, when the FSS layers are applied, show an average of 6-12-dB improvement in the isolation between four adjacent CP-MIMO antennas. In addition, an accurate study is carried out on the insignificant reflections produced by the FSS layers to redirect those and also prevent any interference. The proposed 2 x 2 CP-MIMO antenna along with the superstrate is implemented and tested to validate the simulation results. Experimental results of the coupling and reflection coefficients and axial ratio show an acceptable agreement with the corresponding simulated ones.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatially Decoupling of CP Antennas Based on FSS for 30-GHz MIMO Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2693342","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07903650.pdf","startPage":"6527","endPage":"6537","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2693342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7903650","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903650/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","displayDocTitle":"Spatially Decoupling of CP Antennas Based on FSS for 30-GHz MIMO Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7903650/","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"16870843","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Spatially Decoupling of CP Antennas Based on FSS for 30-GHz MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"access-akbari-2693342-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128802S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7903650","onlineDate":"18 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7903651,"authors":[{"name":"Wael Taha Elsayed","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/7938534/7903651/elsay-2695122-small.gif","p":["Wael Taha Elsayed (GSM\u201913) was born in Qaluobia, Egypt, in\n 1985.

Practical features such as valve point effects, prohibited operating zones, multiple fuel options, and ramp rate limits are considered in the mathematical formulation of the economic dispatch problem. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, five benchmark test systems are utilized.

This active shared aperture realizes the required isolation level of 48 dB between transmit (TX) (30 GHz) and receive (RX) (20 GHz) channels of a ground terminal for two-way satellite communication. It can be applied in very small aperture terminals. The dual-frequency shared aperture can be used as a building block for a linearly or circularly polarized phased-array feed in a focal-plane array system. It includes a 20-GHz low-noise amplifier with on-chip notch filtering realized in a 0.25-\u03bcm SiGe:C BiCMOS technology. The on-chip filter achieves 30 dB of attenuation at 30 GHz with only 0.4 dB noise figure degradation. The isolation is further enhanced by a novel dual-frequency shared-aperture concept based on defected ground structures in the printed circuit board. Experimental results from the prototype show an overall isolation between TX and RX channel of more than 50 dB at 30 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2017.2695258","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/7855842/07903659.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2017.2695258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855842","startPage":"2042","endPage":"2045","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Active Ka-Band Shared-Aperture Antenna With 50 dB Isolation for Satellite Communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7903659","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Active Ka-Band Shared-Aperture Antenna With 50 dB Isolation for Satellite Communication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903659/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17017478","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7903659/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Active Ka-Band Shared-Aperture Antenna With 50 dB Isolation for Satellite Communication","sourcePdf":"lawp-smolders-2695258-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0539S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"7855842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","xplore-issue":"7855842","articleId":"7903659","onlineDate":"18 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7903663,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Vigilante","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KU Leuven, Heverlee, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7987836/7903663/vigil-2690864-small.gif","p":["Marco Vigilante (S\u201913) was born in Carpi, Italy, in 1988.

When the users access the channel orthogonally, analog transmission of correlated information over fading multiple access channels (MACs) using modulo-like mappings provides better performance than uncoded transmission. In this paper, we propose a simplified decoder for modulo mappings in possibly non-orthogonal MAC scenarios with a single-antenna users and a multiple-antenna receiver. Sphere decoding is investigated to reduce the computational complexity when the number of users is large. In addition, affordable strategies are proposed to optimize the mapping parameters according to the channel conditions and the source correlation. The obtained results show that the use of modulo mappings is suitable when the number of antennas at the receiver is larger than the number of users and for high correlation between user data.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2695197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7979727","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2695197","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7979727/07903664.pdf","startPage":"2999","endPage":"3011","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog Transmission of Correlated Sources Over Fading SIMO Multiple Access Channels","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/26/7979727/7903664-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Analog Transmission of Correlated Sources Over Fading SIMO Multiple Access Channels","volume":"65","issue":"7","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7903664/","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17026943","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903664/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ONRG of United States","grantNumber":"N62909-15-1-2014"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-1618653"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008425","fundingName":"Xunta de Galicia","grantNumber":"ED431C 2016-045"},{"fundingName":"Agencia Estatal de Investigaci\u00f3n of Spain and ERDF funds of the EU (AEI/FEDER, UE)","grantNumber":"TEC2013-47141-C4-1-R and TEC2016-75067-C4-1-R"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Analog Transmission of Correlated Sources Over Fading SIMO Multiple Access Channels","sourcePdf":"tcomm-suarezcasal-2695197-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080883S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7979727","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7979727","articleId":"7903664","onlineDate":"18 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":7903672,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/8425815/7903672/chen-2694966-small.gif","p":["Chen Chen (S\u201915) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2012.

Discarding the DC coefficient directly in each transform block leads to substantial bit-saving, but at the same time produces strong discontinuities between neighboring blocks. To overcome this problem, we propose an estimation algorithm for the DC coefficient, which solves an optimal offset in a closed-form to recover the corresponding block edges. Then, we embed this algorithm into HEVC in its rate-distortion optimized quantization and sign bit hiding steps. Furthermore, a flag is signaled to decide whether the DC estimation strategy is used for each transform block. Test results under the common test condition show that our algorithm achieves 1.5% and 1.6% BD-rate reduction on average for luma and chroma, respectively, under all intra configuration. In the meantime, our simulation results show that both encoding time and decoding time increase only slightly (about 10%, without any special optimization on programming our proposed algorithm). When testing the proposed DC estimation algorithm on inter coding configurations, including low delay with P pictures, low delay with B pictures, and random access, we can also achieve 0.5%-1.1% bit-rate savings on average, while nearly no extra encoding and decoding time is needed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DC Coefficient Estimation of Intra-Predicted Residuals in HEVC","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2017.2694966","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/8425815/07903672.pdf","startPage":"1906","endPage":"1919","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2017.2694966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8425815","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7903672","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903672/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","displayDocTitle":"DC Coefficient Estimation of Intra-Predicted Residuals in HEVC","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7903672/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2018","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"17990278","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2015CB351804"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61370148 and 61672134"},{"fundingName":"111 Projects","grantNumber":"B17008"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DC Coefficient Estimation of Intra-Predicted Residuals in HEVC","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-chen-2694966-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144217S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"8425815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8425815","articleId":"7903672","onlineDate":"18 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7903676,"authors":[{"name":"Yongle Wu","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Work Safety Intelligent Monitoring, School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7903676/wu-2695220-small.gif","p":["Yongle Wu (M\u201912\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.Eng. degree in communication engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China, in 2006 and 2011, respectively.","In 2010, he was a Research Assistant with the City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.

The baseband processing is done at the baseband unit (BBU), centrally for a huge number of remote radio head (RRH). The BBU pool works virtually and significantly to reduce power consumption in the cellular networks. Efficient coordination among these BBUs can improve network performance in terms of resource utilization and power consumption.

Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm improves power consumption up to 20% and reduces handover overhead up to 30% compared with the traditional approach.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2695545","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2695545","startPage":"1637","endPage":"1640","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7972692/07903689.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7972692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient BBU Allocation for Green C-RAN","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903689/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient BBU Allocation for Green C-RAN","volume":"21","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17013074","publicationDate":"July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7903689/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010002","fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"NRF-2016R1D1A1B03935633"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient BBU Allocation for Green C-RAN","sourcePdf":"lcomm-saxena-2695545-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052049S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7972692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7972692","articleId":"7903689","onlineDate":"18 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7903690,"authors":[{"name":"Chuan-Yu Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chuan-Yu","lastName":"Sun","id":"37086353478"},{"name":"Shuenn-Yuh Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shuenn-Yuh","lastName":"Lee","orcid":"0000-0002-9757-1410","id":"37293419600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7903690","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1247},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7903690","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power filters","MODIS","Transconductance","Low-pass filters","Electrocardiography","Information filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electronics","Butterworth filters","capacitors","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","electrocardiography","harmonic distortion","low-pass filters","MIM structures","operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MODI OTA","ECG applications","metal-insulator-metal capacitors","electrocardiography applications","current division technology","complementary metal-oxide- semiconductor technology","fifth-order Butterworth OTA-C LPF","fifth-order Butterworth operational transconductance amplifier-C low-pass filter","multiple-output differential-input OTA structure","power dissipation","total harmonic distortion","voltage 86.0 mV","power 350.0 nW","size 0.18 mum","bandwidth 50.0 Hz","voltage 1 mV","C","V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low power","low-pass filter","operational transconductance amplifier","current cancellation","source degeneration","multiple output"]}],"abstract":"This brief proposes a fifth-order Butterworth operational transconductance amplifier-C (OTA-C) low-pass filter (LPF) with multiple-output differential-input (MODI) OTA structure and metal-insulator-metal capacitors for electrocardiography applications.

However, research on methodologies suitable for online performance is still very limited. In this paper, we present an online framework for video anomaly detection. The key aspect of our framework is a compact set of highly descriptive features, which is extracted from a novel cell structure that helps to define support regions in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Based on the scene's activity, only a limited number of support regions are processed, thus limiting the size of the feature set. Specifically, we use foreground occupancy and optical flow features. The framework uses an inference mechanism that evaluates the compact feature set via Gaussian Mixture Models, Markov Chains, and Bag-of-Words in order to detect abnormal events. Our framework also considers the joint response of the models in the local spatio-temporal neighborhood to increase detection accuracy. We test our framework on popular existing data sets and on a new data set comprising a wide variety of realistic videos captured by surveillance cameras. This particular data set includes surveillance videos depicting criminal activities, car accidents, and other dangerous situations. Evaluation results show that our framework outperforms other online methods and attains a very competitive detection performance compared with state-of-the-art non-online methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7922633/07903693.pdf","startPage":"3463","endPage":"3478","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2017.2695105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2017.2695105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7922633","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7903693","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video Anomaly Detection With Compact Feature Sets for Online Performance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Cameras","Optical imaging","Video surveillance","Training","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","Gaussian processes","Markov processes","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov chains","Bag-of-Words","spatio-temporal neighborhood","surveillance videos","feature extraction","Gaussian mixture models","inference mechanism","foreground occupancy","optical flow features","video anomaly detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video anomaly detection","online processing","video surveillance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903693/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Video Anomaly Detection With Compact Feature Sets for Online Performance","volume":"26","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7903693/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"16896548","pubMedId":"28436865","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Mexican Ministry of Education"},{"fundingName":"SEP-CONACYT"},{"fundingName":"EU H2020 under Project-IDENTITY"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video Anomaly Detection With Compact Feature Sets for Online Performance","sourcePdf":"tip-leyva-2695105-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166049S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7922633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"7922633","articleId":"7903693","onlineDate":"18 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7903694,"authors":[{"name":"Baoming Sun","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7979727/7903694/sun-2695198-small.gif","p":["Baoming Sun received the B.S. degree from the School of Mechanical Engineering and Electronic Information, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China, in 2010, and the M.S. degree from the Institute of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the College of Communications Engineering.

Since the number of targets is usually limited, localization benefits from compressed sensing (CS): measurements number can be greatly reduced. Despite many CS-based localization schemes, existing solutions implicitly assume that all targets fall on a fixed grid exactly. When the assumption is violated, the mismatch between the assumed and actual sparsifying dictionaries can deteriorate the localization performance significantly. To address such a problem, in this paper, we propose a novel and iterative multiple target counting and localization framework. The key idea behind the framework is to dynamically adjust the grid to alleviate or even eliminate dictionary mismatch. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we consider the off-grid target issue in CS-based localization and formulate multiple target counting and localization as a joint sparse signal recovery and parameter estimation problem. Second, we solve the joint optimization problem using a variational Bayesian expectation-maximization algorithm where the sparse signal and parameter are iteratively updated in the variational Bayesian expectation-step and variational Bayesian maximization-step, respectively. Extensive simulation results highlight the superior performance of the proposed framework in terms of probability of correct counting and average localization error.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2695198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2695198","startPage":"2985","endPage":"2998","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7979727/07903694.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7979727","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple Target Counting and Localization Using Variational Bayesian EM Algorithm in Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903694/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Target Counting and Localization Using Variational Bayesian EM Algorithm in Wireless Sensor Networks","volume":"65","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17026950","publicationDate":"July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7903694/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571463, 61371124 and 61472445"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Target Counting and Localization Using Variational Bayesian EM Algorithm in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-guo-2695198-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13397S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7979727","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7979727","articleId":"7903694","onlineDate":"18 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7903696,"authors":[{"name":"Zhuang Ling","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7903696/ling-2695222-small.gif","p":["Zhuang Ling received the B.S. degree from the College of Communication Engineering, Jilin University, Jilin, China, in 2016, where he is currently pursuing the M.S. degree with the Information and Signal Processing Lab.

Based on two protocols, the optimal power splitting and time switching ratios are derived in each scenario. The goal of this paper is to maximize the information throughput from the sensor to the access point in uplink by balancing the time duration among the command transfer phase, the energy harvesting phase, and the information transfer phase while satisfying energy harvesting and consumption balance constraint at the sensor. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the optimal solution.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2695222","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07903696.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2695222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","startPage":"8620","endPage":"8628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Point-to-Point Wireless Information and Power Transfer in WBAN With Energy Harvesting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7903696","topic":"Exploiting the Benefits of Interference in Wireless Networks: Energy Harvesting and Security","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Point-to-Point Wireless Information and Power Transfer in WBAN With Energy Harvesting","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903696/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2017","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"16904630","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7903696/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671219 and 61273064"},{"fundingName":"Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Department Key Scientific and Technological Project","grantNumber":"20140204034GX"},{"fundingName":"Jilin Province Development and Reform Commission","grantNumber":"2015Y043"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Point-to-Point Wireless Information and Power Transfer in WBAN With Energy Harvesting","sourcePdf":"access-ling-2695222-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140711S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Exploiting the Benefits of Interference in Wireless Networks: Energy Harvesting and Security"],"articleId":"7903696","onlineDate":"18 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7903698,"authors":[{"name":"Shilei Xu","affiliation":["School of Instrument Science and Opto-Electronics Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shilei","lastName":"Xu","orcid":"0000-0003-0947-8935","id":"37085593141"},{"name":"Xiquan Liu","affiliation":["School of Instrument Science and Opto-Electronics Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiquan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086022745"},{"name":"Yun Le","affiliation":["School of Instrument Science and Opto-Electronics Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Le","id":"37074313900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"7903698","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":888},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7903698","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic levitation","Rotors","Magnetic fields","Stators","Solids","Air gaps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eddy current losses","magnetic bearings","magnetic fields","permanent magnet motors","rotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic design","high-speed solid cylindrical permanent-magnet motor","active magnetic bearings","high-speed solid cylindrical PM machine","magnetic field analytical model","solid cylindrical PM machine","ring PM machine","machine configuration","magnetic design","rotor eddy-current loss","power density","magnetic force","high-speed solid cylindrical PM motor","serial experimental tests","theoretical design","power 30 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analytical model","high speed","magnetic bearings","magnetic field","permanent magnet (PM)","PM machines"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the design in electromagnetic aspect of a high-speed solid cylindrical permanent-magnet (PM) machine equipped with magnetic bearings. First, the selection of PM machine structures is discussed. In specific, the analytical models of magnetic field for the solid cylindrical PM machine and ring PM machine are established; then, these two machine configurations are compared from the perspectives of magnetic design and rotor eddy-current losses, and the results show that the solid cylindrical PM machines have higher power density and lesser rotor eddy-current losses than ring PM machines. Subsequently, the rotor structures are described, and some integrated considerations in design of high-speed PM machines equipped with magnetic bearings are pointed out. Then, the configurations of magnetic bearings used for the machines are determined, and their analytical formulas of magnetic force are deduced. Ultimately, a 30 kW 60 000 r/min high-speed solid cylindrical PM motor equipped with magnetic bearings is designed and manufactured, and serial experimental tests are conducted on this prototype to verify the theoretical design and the practical performance of the machine.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/7983368/07903698.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2017.2695540","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2017.2695540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7983368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electromagnetic Design of a High-Speed Solid Cylindrical Permanent-Magnet Motor Equipped With Active Magnetic Bearings","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Electromagnetic Design of a High-Speed Solid Cylindrical Permanent-Magnet Motor Equipped With Active Magnetic Bearings","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903698/","externalId":"8203715","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7903698/","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17030888","volume":"53","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electromagnetic Design of a High-Speed Solid Cylindrical Permanent-Magnet Motor Equipped With Active Magnetic Bearings","sourcePdf":"tmag-xu-2695540-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090422S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"7983368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7983368","articleId":"7903698","onlineDate":"18 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7903703,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyong Wu","affiliation":["Wireless Communication and Sensor Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7903703/wu-2695007-small.gif","p":["Xiaoyong Wu received the master\u2019s degree from Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China, in 2013.

Much research on the FP condition emerges under different assumptions, most of which has been proved to satisfy the FP condition for some massive MIMO implementations. A generic channel model without mutual coupling is proposed to study more general implementations than previously investigated. Two theorems establish: 1) conditions on the steering matrix alone that are sufficient to guarantee the FP condition holds and 2) that a simple condition on the steering matrix alone is sufficient to guarantee FP for all practical massive MIMO implementations. Then the uniform linear array, uniform planar array (UPA), and uniform circular array (UCA) antenna configurations are studied. Theoretical analyses indicate how close and how fast the inner product of different steering vectors converges to zero for a finite number of base station (BS) antennas, and prove that the FP condition is satisfied for the antenna configuration considered for an unlimited number of BS antennas only if the antenna spacing is not proportional to the reciprocal of the number of antennas. The analysis shows that the UCA has the shortest distance from the FP condition among the three antenna structures, while the UPA is especially suitable for massive MIMO systems for 5G owing to its good FP performance and compact physical size. Simulation results validate the theory.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2695007","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07903703.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2695007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","startPage":"5578","endPage":"5593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Favorable Propagation in Massive MIMO Systems and Different Antenna Configurations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7903703","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On Favorable Propagation in Massive MIMO Systems and Different Antenna Configurations","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903703/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2017","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"16870824","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7903703/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"China National 863 Project","grantNumber":"2014AA01A705"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271257 and  61171107"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"On Favorable Propagation in Massive MIMO Systems and Different Antenna Configurations","sourcePdf":"access-wu-2695007-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078309S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7903703","onlineDate":"18 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7903719,"authors":[{"name":"Maik Simon","affiliation":["NaMLab gGmbH, Dresden, Germany","Center for Advancing Electronics Dresden (CfAED), TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Maik","lastName":"Simon","id":"37086076979"},{"name":"Andr\u00e9 Heinzig","affiliation":["Center for Advancing Electronics Dresden (CfAED), TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Andr\u00e9","lastName":"Heinzig","id":"37085407013"},{"name":"Jens Trommer","affiliation":["NaMLab gGmbH, Dresden, Germany","Center for Advancing Electronics Dresden (CfAED), TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Jens","lastName":"Trommer","id":"37085510241"},{"name":"Tim Baldauf","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Applied Sciences Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Baldauf","id":"37085545737"},{"name":"Thomas Mikolajick","affiliation":["NaMLab gGmbH, Dresden, Germany","Center for Advancing Electronics Dresden (CfAED), TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Mikolajick","id":"37264991900"},{"name":"Walter M.

Unlike conventional stochastic programming approaches that rely on detailed information of the exact probability distribution, the proposed method attempts to minimize the expectation term over a collection of distributions characterized by accessible statistical measures, so it is more practical in cases where the detailed distribution data is unavailable. This planning model is formulated as a two-stage problem, where the wind power capacity allocation decisions are determined in the first stage, before the observation of uncertainty outcomes, and operation decisions are made in the second stage under specific uncertainty realizations. In this paper, the second-stage decisions are approximated by linear decision rule functions, so that the distributionally robust model can be reformulated into a tractable second-order cone programming problem. Case studies based on a five-area system are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903721/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7903721/","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17482041","volume":"33","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Wind Farm Allocation in Multi-Area Power Systems Using Distributionally Robust Optimization Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Wind Farm Allocation in Multi-Area Power Systems Using Distributionally Robust Optimization Approach","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-alismail-2695002-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154551S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"8231802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8231802","articleId":"7903721","onlineDate":"18 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7903728,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Sajjad Bahman","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8126282/7903728/bahma-2694548-small.gif","p":["Amir Sajjad Bahman (S\u201908\u2013M\u201915) received the B.Sc.\n degree from Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, in 2008, the M.Sc. degree from Chalmers University of\n Technology, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree from Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark, in 2015,\n all in electrical engineering.","He was a Visiting Scholar with the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Arkansas, USA, in 2014.

However, the existing thermal models have their limits to correctly predict these complicated thermal behavior in the IGBTs: The typically used thermal model based on one-dimensional RC lumps have limits to provide temperature distributions inside the device; moreover, some variable factors in the real-field applications like the cooling and heating conditions of the converter cannot be adapted. On the other hand, the more advanced three-dimensional (3-D) thermal models based on finite-element method (FEM) need massive computations, which make the long-term thermal dynamics difficult to calculate. In this paper, a new lumped 3-D thermal model is proposed, which can be easily characterized from FEM simulations and can acquire the critical thermal distribution under long-term studies. Meanwhile, the boundary conditions for the thermal analysis are modeled and included, which can be adapted to different real-field applications of power electronic converters. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed thermal model is verified by FEM simulations and experimental results show a good agreement.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Lumped Thermal Model Including Thermal Coupling and Thermal Boundary Conditions for High-Power IGBT Modules","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2017.2694548","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8126282/07903728.pdf","startPage":"2518","endPage":"2530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2017.2694548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8126282","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7903728","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903728/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","displayDocTitle":"A Lumped Thermal Model Including Thermal Coupling and Thermal Boundary Conditions for High-Power IGBT Modules","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7903728/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2017","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17427551","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Center of Reliable Power Electronics (CORPE)"},{"fundingName":"Department of Energy Technology"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002702","fundingName":"Aalborg University, Denmark"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Lumped Thermal Model Including Thermal Coupling and Thermal Boundary Conditions for High-Power IGBT Modules","sourcePdf":"tpel-bahman-2694548-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071663S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8126282","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"8126282","articleId":"7903728","onlineDate":"18 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7903730,"authors":[{"name":"Xu-Yao Zhang","affiliation":["NLPR, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, P.R.\u00a0China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/8306529/7903730/zhang-2695539-small.gif","p":["Xu-Yao Zhang received the BS degree in computational mathematics from\n Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2008 and the PhD degree in pattern recognition and intelligent systems from the\n Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2013.

Chinese characters are among the most widely adopted writing systems in the world. Previous research has mainly focused on recognizing handwritten Chinese characters. However, recognition is only one aspect for understanding a language, another challenging and interesting task is to teach a machine to automatically write (pictographic) Chinese characters. In this paper, we propose a framework by using the recurrent neural network (RNN) as both a discriminative model for recognizing Chinese characters and a generative model for drawing (generating) Chinese characters. To recognize Chinese characters, previous methods usually adopt the convolutional neural network (CNN) models which require transforming the online handwriting trajectory into image-like representations. Instead, our RNN based approach is an end-to-end system which directly deals with the sequential structure and does not require any domain-specific knowledge. With the RNN system (combining an LSTM and GRU), state-of-the-art performance can be achieved on the ICDAR-2013 competition database. Furthermore, under the RNN framework, a conditional generative model with character embedding is proposed for automatically drawing recognizable Chinese characters. The generated characters (in vector format) are human-readable and also can be recognized by the discriminative RNN model with high accuracy. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of using RNNs as both generative and discriminative models for the tasks of drawing and recognizing Chinese characters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Drawing and Recognizing Chinese Characters with Recurrent Neural Network","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2017.2695539","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/8306529/07903730.pdf","startPage":"849","endPage":"862","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2017.2695539","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8306529","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7903730","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903730/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 1 2018","displayDocTitle":"Drawing and Recognizing Chinese Characters with Recurrent Neural Network","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7903730/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2018","publicationDate":"1 April 2018","accessionNumber":"17600093","pubMedId":"28436845","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"XDB02060009"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61403380 and 61573355"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Drawing and Recognizing Chinese Characters with Recurrent Neural Network","sourcePdf":"tpami-zhang-2695539-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109854S","chronDate":"April 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"8306529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"8306529","articleId":"7903730","onlineDate":"18 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7903732,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohuan Wu","affiliation":["Key Lab of Broadband Wireless Communication and Sensor Network Technology, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8039128/7903732/wu-2695226-small.gif","p":["Xiaohuan Wu received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering in\n 2010 from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China, where he is currently working toward the\n Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.

However, pervious works reveal that the former method cannot address the case in which the number of signals is larger than that of sensors, whereas the latter one always suffers from the influence of basis mismatch. In this paper, to overcome these two shortcomings, we propose a new method called covariance matrix reconstruction approach (CMRA) for both uniform linear array and sparse linear array. In particular, by exploiting the Toeplitz structure of the covariance matrix of the array output, we formulate a low-rank matrix reconstruction (LRMR) problem for covariance matrix recovery. The nonconvex LRMR problem is then relaxed by replacing the rank norm with the nuclear norm and solved using the optimization toolbox. Next, we retrieve the DOAs from the recovered covariance matrix by using the subspace-based methods and obtain an estimated number of signals as a byproduct. We also provide two algorithm implementations for the LRMR problem based on duality and alternating direction method of multipliers, respectively. It is shown that CMRA can be regarded as an atomic norm minimization model or a gridless version of the sparsity-based methods and can recover more signals than sensors with a well-designed array. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, in comparison with some of the existing methods.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2695226","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8039128/07903732.pdf","startPage":"8223","endPage":"8237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2695226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8039128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Toeplitz Covariance Matrix Reconstruction Approach for Direction-of-Arrival Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7903732","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903732/","displayDocTitle":"A Toeplitz Covariance Matrix Reconstruction Approach for Direction-of-Arrival Estimation","volume":"66","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17188103","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7903732/","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61372122 and 61471205"},{"fundingName":"Innovation Program for Postgraduate in Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"0813"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Toeplitz Covariance Matrix Reconstruction Approach for Direction-of-Arrival Estimation","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhu-2695226-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104881S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8039128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"8039128","articleId":"7903732","onlineDate":"18 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7903733,"authors":[{"name":"Tianyu Wu","affiliation":["University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, US"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Tianyu","lastName":"Wu"},{"name":"Kun Yuan","affiliation":["University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, US"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Yuan","orcid":"0000-0001-8394-8187"},{"name":"Qing Ling","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, CN"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Ling","orcid":"0000-0003-4222-5964"},{"name":"Wotao Yin","affiliation":["University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, US"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Wotao","lastName":"Yin","orcid":"0000-0001-6697-9731"},{"name":"Ali H.

The algorithm runs over a network in which the agents communicate with their neighbors and perform local computation. In the proposed algorithm, each agent can compute and communicate independently at different times, for different durations, with the information it has even if the latest information from its neighbors is not yet available. Such an asynchronous algorithm reduces the time that agents would otherwise waste idle because of communication delays or because their neighbors are slower. It also eliminates the need for a global clock for synchronization. Mathematically, the algorithm involves both primal and dual variables, uses fixed step-size parameters, and provably converges to the exact solution under a random agent assumption and both bounded and unbounded delay assumptions. When running synchronously, the algorithm performs just as well as existing competitive synchronous algorithms such as PG-EXTRA, which diverges without synchronization. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings and illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6884276/8350883/7903733-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903733/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","volume":"4","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"17750944","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2018","publicationDate":"June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7903733/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Consensus Optimization With Asynchrony and Delays","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1524250, DMS-1317602, ECCS-1407712 and ECCS-1462397"},{"fundingName":"NSF China","grantNumber":"61573331"},{"fundingName":"DARPA","grantNumber":"N66001-14-2-4029"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Decentralized Consensus Optimization With Asynchrony and Delays","sourcePdf":"tsipn-yin-2695121-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.174937S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6884276","isNumber":"8350883","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6884276","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8350883","articleId":"7903733","onlineDate":"18 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7903734,"authors":[{"name":"Alon Cervera","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics and Mixed-Signal IC, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel"],"firstName":"Alon","lastName":"Cervera","id":"38504383000"},{"name":"Mor Mordechai Peretz","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics and Mixed-Signal IC, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel"],"firstName":"Mor Mordechai","lastName":"Peretz","id":"37270928100"},{"name":"Shmuel Ben-Yaakov","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics and Mixed-Signal IC, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel"],"firstName":"Shmuel","lastName":"Ben-Yaakov","id":"38270062700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8993"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0107"}],"articleNumber":"7903734","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1049},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-pels.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7903734","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Capacitors","Gyrators","Matrix converters","Voltage control","Topology","Integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gyrators","matrix algebra","resonant power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constant gyration factor","port voltages","linear function","Toeplitz global-gyrator matrix","multiport global-gyrator matrix","generic algebraic model","switched-resonator converters","unified global-gyrator model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC-DC power conversion","gyrators","resonant power conversion","switched capacitor circuits","transfer function matrices"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2017.2694858","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8000711/07903734.pdf","startPage":"8945","endPage":"8952","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2017.2694858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8000711","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Generic and Unified Global-Gyrator Model of Switched-Resonator Converters","abstract":"A generic algebraic model of switched-resonator converters is developed and demonstrated by published and new converter configurations data.

Gait retraining has been used to reduce the knee adduction moment, a surrogate of medial tibiofemoral joint loading often used in knee osteoarthritis research. In this paper, we present an electromyogram-driven neuromusculoskeletal model of the lower-limb to estimate, in real-time, the tibiofemoral joint loads. The model included 34 musculotendon units spanning the hip, knee, and ankle joints. Full-body inverse kinematics, inverse dynamics, and musculotendon kinematics were solved in real-time from motion capture and force plate data to estimate the knee medial tibiofemoral contact force (MTFF). We analyzed five healthy subjects while they were walking on an instrumented treadmill with visual biofeedback of their MTFF. Each subject was asked to modify their gait in order to vary the magnitude of their MTFF. All subjects were able to increase their MTFF, whereas only three subjects could decrease it, and only after receiving verbal suggestions about possible gait modification strategies. Results indicate the important role of knee muscle activation patterns in modulating the MTFF. While this paper focused on the knee, the technology can be extended to examine the musculoskeletal tissue loads at different sites of the human body.","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2017.2683488","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and

correspondence, we propose a new receiver design for high-mobility orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) downlink transmissions with a large-scale antenna array. The downlink signal experiences the challenging fast time-varying propagation channel. The time-varying nature originates from the multiple carrier frequency offsets (CFOs) due to the transceiver oscillator frequency offset (OFO) and multiple Doppler shifts. Let the received signal first go through a carefully designed beamforming network, which could separate multiple CFOs in the spatial domain with a sufficient number of receive antennas. A joint estimation method for the Doppler shifts and the OFO is further developed. Then, the conventional single-CFO compensation and channel estimation method can be carried out for each beamforming branch. The proposed receiver design avoids the complicated time-varying channel estimation, which differs a lot from the conventional methods. More importantly, the proposed scheme can be applied to the commonly used time-varying channel models, such as the Jakes' channel model.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2695562","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8039128/07903747.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2695562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8039128","startPage":"8600","endPage":"8604","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Mobility OFDM Downlink Transmission With Large-Scale Antenna Array","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7903747","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-Mobility OFDM Downlink Transmission With Large-Scale Antenna Array","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903747/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17188101","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7903747/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61671366, 61302069 and 61422109"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China","grantNumber":"2016JQ6005"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Mobility OFDM Downlink Transmission With Large-Scale Antenna Array","sourcePdf":"tvt-guo-2695562-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077444S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8039128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"8039128","articleId":"7903747","onlineDate":"18 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7903967,"authors":[{"name":"Leonhard Nobach","affiliation":["Peer-to-Peer Systems Engineering Lab, TU Darmstadt"],"firstName":"Leonhard","lastName":"Nobach","id":"37946759800"},{"name":"Benedikt Rudolph","affiliation":["Peer-to-Peer Systems Engineering Lab, TU Darmstadt"],"firstName":"Benedikt","lastName":"Rudolph","id":"37085549596"},{"name":"David Hausheer","affiliation":["Peer-to-Peer Systems Engineering Lab, TU Darmstadt"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Hausheer","id":"37295318200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4394-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4395-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7903967","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":249},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Benefits of conditional FPGA provisioning for virtualized network functions","abstract":"Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) stands for a major paradigm shift in computer networks. Despite the flexibility improvements which NFV offers, the commonly used COTS processors show performance limitations compared to specialized circuits. A trade-off can be achieved by reconfigurable hardware like FPGAs, which provide high, guaranteed performance and flexibility. However, FPGAs are costly, and the network function resources - programmable gates - have a limited ability to scale in, as they must stay occupied even if the performance requirements are currently low. In this work, we envision to evaluate the advantages that arise from a dynamic provisioning of FPGA resources on the datapath of virtual network functions. In a first step, we evaluate performance characteristics of FPGA and COTS processor resources running an example DPI NF. Given a lease cost model, we furthermore analytically evaluate the advantage of dynamically selecting FPGA or COTS processor resources for this NF, depending on the current performance demands. Our evaluation shows that we can save up to 39% of costs by a dynamic provisioning based on the expected load.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Noise measurement","Program processors","Hardware","Servers","Elasticity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","performance evaluation","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conditional FPGA provisioning","virtualized network functions","network functions virtualization","NFV","computer networks","COTS processors","reconfigurable hardware","datapath","virtual network functions","DPI NF"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7903967","doi":"10.1109/NetSys.2017.7903967","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Networked Systems (NetSys)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Networked Systems (NetSys)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897356/7903943/07903967.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7903943","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NetSys.2017.7903967","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7903967/","displayDocTitle":"Benefits of conditional FPGA provisioning for virtualized network functions","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 March 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2017","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","accessionNumber":"16836491","htmlLink":"/document/7903967/","conferenceDate":"13-16 March 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Benefits of conditional FPGA provisioning for virtualized network functions","confLoc":"Gottingen, Germany","sourcePdf":"sdnflex06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096136S","chronDate":"13-16 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7897356","isNumber":"7903943","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897356","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7903943","articleId":"7903967","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7904276,"authors":[{"name":"Bikash Agrawal","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering, University of Stavanger, Stavanger, Norway"],"firstName":"Bikash","lastName":"Agrawal","id":"37085514080"},{"name":"Tomasz Wiktorski","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering, University of Stavanger, Stavanger, Norway"],"firstName":"Tomasz","lastName":"Wiktorski","id":"37085638136"},{"name":"Chunming Rong","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering, University of Stavanger, Stavanger, Norway"],"firstName":"Chunming","lastName":"Rong","id":"37411450600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4152-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4153-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7904276","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":289},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Principal component analysis","Robustness","Sparks","Matrix decomposition","Monitoring","Cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","learning (artificial intelligence)","parallel processing","principal component analysis","security of data","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive anomaly detection","cloud anomalous activity detection","scalable principal component analysis","automatic anomaly detection","system characteristics learning","datacenter monitoring","cloud performance data","performance metrics","low-rank matrix","orthogonal distance","robust PCA algorithm","reconstruction error minimization","distributed environments","Apache Spark","Google data center traces","Yahoo! datasets","Hadoop","singular value decomposition","SVD"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly detection","Outlier detection","Robust PCA","Spark","Hadoop","Data center","performance analysis","SVD"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a novel and scalable model for automatic anomaly detection on a large system such as a cloud. Anomaly detection issues early warning of unusual behavior in dynamic environments by learning system characteristic from normal operational data. Anomaly detection in large systems is difficult to detect due heterogeneity, dynamicity, scalability, hidden complexity, and time limitation. To detect anomalous activity in the cloud, we need to monitor the datacenter and collect cloud performance data. In this paper, we propose an adaptive anomaly detection mechanism which investigates principal components of performance metrics. It transforms the performance metrics into a low-rank matrix and then calculates the orthogonal distance using the Robust PCA algorithm. The proposed model updates itself recursively learning and adjusting the new threshold value in order to minimize reconstruction errors. This paper also investigates the robust principal component analysis in distributed environments using Apache Spark as the underlying framework, specifically addressing cases in which a normal operation might exhibit multiple hidden modes. The accuracy and sensitivity of the model is tested on Google data center traces and Yahoo! datasets. The model achieves an 87.24% accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Anomaly Detection in Cloud Using Robust and Scalable Principal Component Analysis","publicationTitle":"2016 15th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing (ISPDC)","doi":"10.1109/ISPDC.2016.22","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 15th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing (ISPDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7901691/7904253/07904276.pdf","startPage":"100","endPage":"106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPDC.2016.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7904253","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7904276","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7904276/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Anomaly Detection in Cloud Using Robust and Scalable Principal Component Analysis","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7904276/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16824954","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Anomaly Detection in Cloud Using Robust and Scalable Principal Component Analysis","confLoc":"Fuzhou, China","sourcePdf":"4152a100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09394S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7901691","isNumber":"7904253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7901691","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7904253","articleId":"7904276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7904286,"authors":[{"name":"Zhanghui Liu","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Computer Science, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China","Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Networking Computing and Intelligent Information Processing"],"firstName":"Zhanghui","lastName":"Liu","id":"38237383900"},{"name":"Xuee Zeng","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Computer Science, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China","Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Networking Computing and Intelligent Information Processing"],"firstName":"Xuee","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37085722822"},{"name":"Wensi Huang","affiliation":["State Grid Info-Telecom Great Power Science and Technology Co., Ltd, China"],"firstName":"Wensi","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086012771"},{"name":"Junxin Lin","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Computer Science, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China","Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Networking Computing and Intelligent Information Processing"],"firstName":"Junxin","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086007476"},{"name":"Xing Chen","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Computer Science, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China","Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Networking Computing and Intelligent Information Processing"],"firstName":"Xing","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085562757"},{"name":"Wenzhong Guo","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Computer Science, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China","Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Networking Computing and Intelligent Information Processing"],"firstName":"Wenzhong","lastName":"Guo","id":"37598055000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4152-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4153-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7904286","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":505},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Mobile communication","Mobile handsets","Computational modeling","Runtime","Servers","Context"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","mobile computing","object-oriented methods","power consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design pattern","cloudlets","battery power consumption","mobile cloud computing","context-aware computation offloading"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computation Offloading","Mobile Cloud Computing","Context-aware"]}],"abstract":"Computation offloading is a promising way to improve the performance as well as reducing the battery power consumption of a mobile application by executing some parts of the application on a remote server. Recent researches on mobile cloud computing mainly focus on the code partitioning and offloading techniques, assuming that mobile codes are offloaded to a prepared server. However, the context of a mobile device, such as locations and network conditions, changes continuously as it moves throughout the day, and there are multiple options of cloud resources, including remote cloud computing services and nearby cloudlets. In order to offload computation to the cloud resource with powerful processors as well as fast network connection, it needs to dynamically select the appropriate cloud resource and then offload mobile codes to it at runtime, according to the context of the mobile device and possible cloud resources. In this paper, we present a framework for context-aware computation offloading. First, a design pattern is proposed to enable an application to be computation offloaded on-demand. Second, an estimation model is presented to automatically select the cloud resource for computation offloading. Runtime data about computation tasks, contexts of the mobile device and possible cloud resources is collected and modeled at client side, in order to make an optimal offloading decision. A thorough evaluation on two real-world applications is proposed, and the results show that our approach can help reduce execution time by 6%-96% and power consumption by 60%-96% for computation-intensive applications.","doi":"10.1109/ISPDC.2016.30","publicationTitle":"2016 15th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing (ISPDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 15th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing (ISPDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7901691/7904253/07904286.pdf","startPage":"172","endPage":"177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPDC.2016.30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7904253","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7904286","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Framework for Context-Aware Computation Offloading in Mobile Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7904286/","displayDocTitle":"Framework for Context-Aware Computation Offloading in Mobile Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7904286/","publicationDate":"2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16837194","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Framework for Context-Aware Computation Offloading in Mobile Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Fuzhou, China","sourcePdf":"4152a172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064667S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7901691","isNumber":"7904253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7901691","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7904253","articleId":"7904286","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7904292,"authors":[{"name":"Zafeiroula Georgiopoulou","affiliation":["Digital Systems University of Piraeus, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Zafeiroula","lastName":"Georgiopoulou","id":"37086036559"},{"name":"Costas Lambrinoudakis","affiliation":["Digital Systems University of Piraeus, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Costas","lastName":"Lambrinoudakis","id":"37330917000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4152-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4153-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7904292","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":376},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Computational modeling","Authentication","Measurement","Computer architecture","Organizations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","security of data","trusted computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trust models","cloud computing","trust management","security threats"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Trust","Trust Management","Trust Models","Privacy","Trust metric"]}],"abstract":"Proper trust management in cloud computing environments can significantly assist their widespread adoption.

The traditional Transient Earth Voltages (TEV) methods of the switchgear and GIS usually consist of four steps, i.e. data gathering, filtering, feature extraction and pattern recognition. These methods generate features using statistical analysis or waveform analysis of the signals, and then conduct the recognition and classification operations. In recent years, the increasingly developing deep learning methods have a huge effect on the pattern recognition, due to its outstanding abilities of recognition and feature extraction, which greatly offset the poor recognition performance of the traditional TEV methods. A novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based TEV detection method is proposed in the paper, which needs no signal feature prepared by human and overcomes the detection problems resulted from an inappropriately selected feature. A CNN model is designed to train and classify the spectral image of the TEV. Although no sophisticated denoising method is adopted in the preprocessing, the proposed method approaches an extraordinary detection performance, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our CNN based TEV detection method.","doi":"10.1109/ISPDC.2016.65","publicationTitle":"2016 15th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing (ISPDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 15th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing (ISPDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7901691/7904253/07904322.pdf","startPage":"386","endPage":"389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7904253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPDC.2016.65","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convolutional Neural Network Based Transient Earth Voltage Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7904322/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Convolutional Neural Network Based Transient Earth Voltage Detection","htmlLink":"/document/7904322/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16824968","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2016","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convolutional Neural Network Based Transient Earth Voltage Detection","confLoc":"Fuzhou, China","sourcePdf":"4152a386.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043109S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7901691","isNumber":"7904253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7901691","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7904253","articleId":"7904322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7904331,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Tien Fan","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Tien","lastName":"Fan","id":"37596592700"},{"name":"Zong-You Wu","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Zong-You","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086135988"},{"name":"Che-Pin Chang","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Che-Pin","lastName":"Chang","id":"37085804700"},{"name":"Shyan Ming Yuan","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shyan Ming","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37278196500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4152-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4153-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7904331","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":373},"abstract":"The bandwidth of the network is precious. As cloud computing provides powerful computation power and more and more devices are connected to the Internet there is a need to seek for methods to reduce the traffic. Fog computing was proposed to adding the computation and storage ability to the edge devices. The requests from the end device can be pre-processed or even responded at the edge device. In this work, the ability of Web Resource Caching is added to the edge device to serve as a caching proxy server. In order to obtain more caching storage, the end devices are also exploits to provide some caching space. As the whole caching storage is enlarged, large resource like media files are able to be cached near to the end devices once any of the end devices in the same network just recently requested it. The result shows that the proposed architecture has better downloading latency compares to the single caching proxy approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 15th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing (ISPDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7901691/7904253/07904331.pdf","startPage":"432","endPage":"439","publicationTitle":"2016 15th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing (ISPDC)","doi":"10.1109/ISPDC.2016.74","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPDC.2016.74","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7904253","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7904331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Web Resource Cacheable Edge Device in Fog Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Servers","Edge computing","Bandwidth","Computer architecture","Content distribution networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","cloud computing","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Web resource cacheable edge device","fog computing","network bandwidth","cloud computing","Internet","traffic reduction","caching proxy server","caching storage","caching space","media file caching","downloading latency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fog Computing","Caching Proxy Architecture","Cloud Computing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7904331/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Web Resource Cacheable Edge Device in Fog Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7904331/","publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16824934","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Web Resource Cacheable Edge Device in Fog Computing","confLoc":"Fuzhou, China","sourcePdf":"4152a432.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056031S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7901691","isNumber":"7904253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7901691","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7904253","articleId":"7904331","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7904593,"authors":[{"name":"Jo\u00e3o F.

With this motion typically being available over mechanical bandwidths of several kilohertz or greater, nanopositioners have become important tools for many areas of nanotechnology. A major development in nanopositioning has been the use of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) fabrication processes to produce microscale nanopositioners. These MEMS-based devices are conceptually similar to their macroscale counterparts, typically comprising an end effector, actuators, sensors, and suspension structures. However, MEMS nanopositioners potentially offer additional significant advantages as a result of their microfabricated nature, including a much smaller footprint, higher bandwidth, batch manufacturability, and potential for integration with electronic circuits. This paper reviews key concepts regarding the design, actuation, and sensing of MEMS nanopositioners, and explores how they have been implemented in state-of-the-art devices within a range of nanotechnology applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7904597/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"26","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2017","accessionNumber":"16917787","htmlLink":"/document/7904597/","displayDocTitle":"MEMS for Nanopositioning: Design and Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MEMS for Nanopositioning: Design and Applications","sourcePdf":"jmems-maroufi-2687861-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.300445S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"7936684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7936684","articleId":"7904597","onlineDate":"19 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7904599,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Xie","affiliation":["Laboratory of Computer Engineering, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/8263325/7904599/xie-2695880-small.gif","p":["Lei Xie (S\u201915) received the bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in microelectronics from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China.

Memristor crossbar-based logic circuit is one of the promising candidates to at least partially replace CMOS technology, which is facing many challenges such as reduced scalability, reliability, and performance gain. Memristor crossbar offers many advantages including scalability, high integration density, nonvolatility, etc. The state-of-the-art for memristor crossbar logic circuit design can only implement simple and small circuits. This paper proposes a mapping methodology of large Boolean logic circuits on memristor crossbar. Appropriate place-and-route schemes, to efficiently map the circuits on the crossbar, as well as several optimization schemes are also proposed. To illustrate the potential of the methodology, a multibit adder and other nine more complex benchmarks are studied; the delay, area and power consumption induced by both crossbar and its CMOS control part are evaluated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7904599/","volume":"37","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7904599/","accessionNumber":"17519464","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Mapping Methodology of Boolean Logic Circuits on Memristor Crossbar","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council","grantNumber":"No. 201306280020"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Mapping Methodology of Boolean Logic Circuits on Memristor Crossbar","sourcePdf":"tcad-xie-2695880-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101615S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"8263325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8263325","articleId":"7904599","onlineDate":"19 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7904601,"authors":[{"name":"Pengfei Zhao","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Pengfei","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085531081"},{"name":"Yong Liu","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086092017"},{"name":"Hongda Lu","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongda","lastName":"Lu","id":"38237457800"},{"name":"Yuming Wu","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuming","lastName":"Wu","id":"38488589900"},{"name":"Xin Lv","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Lv","id":"37302343400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"7904601","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":960},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"A terahertz (THz) waveguide-fed circularly polarized double-fan-shaped slot antenna (DFSSA) based on a silicon micromachining technology is proposed.

The system comprises multiple innovative mechanisms in background modeling, model update, pixel classification, and the use of multiple color spaces. The system first creates multiple background models of the scene followed by an initial foreground/background probability estimation for each pixel. Next, the image pixels are merged together to form mega-pixels, which are used to spatially denoise the initial probability estimates to generate binary masks for both RGB and YCbCr color spaces. The masks generated after processing these input images are then combined to separate foreground pixels from the background.

This scheme is based on modifying the existing Para-CORDIC architecture with an approximation that is inserted in multiple parts and made possible by relaxing the CORDIC algorithm itself. A fully parallel approximate CORDIC (FPAX-CORDIC) scheme is proposed. This scheme avoids the memory register of Para-CORDIC and makes the generation of the rotation direction fully parallel. A comprehensive analysis and the evaluation of the error introduced by the approximation together with different circuit-related metrics are pursued using HSPICE as the simulation tool. This error analysis also combines existing figures of merit for approximate computing (such as the Mean Error Distance (MED) and MED Power Product (MPP)) with CORDIC specific parameters. It is shown that a good agreement between expected and simulated error values is found. The Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) and the Inverse DCT (IDCT) transformations as case study of approximate computing to image processing are investigated by utilizing the proposed approximate FPAX-CORDIC architecture with different accuracy requirements.

This also reduces distortions due to drain-source and gate-source nonlinear capacitances at both common source (CS) and common gate (CG) stages. The configuration allows the amplifier linear characteristics to be robust against gate node voltage variations of CG transistors compared to previous multigated transistor linearization methods, because the CG transistors always remain in the saturation region and the nonlinearities of capacitances associated with CG transistors cancel each other under a wide range of output powers. In addition, an active feedback linearizer is applied to improve AM-AM and the power-added efficiency (PAE) at high output powers. At 5.15 GHz, the proposed PA is tested with a 256-quadrature amplitude modulation WLAN 802.11ac signal source without digital predistortions.

The SU message is then forwarded from the primary BS to the secondary network with a certain incentive reward as a part of the cooperation protocol between both the networks. A special linear precoding scheme is proposed to enable the SU to exploit the PU free eigenmodes. We analyze two scenarios in which the UAV relay gain matrix is either fixed or optimized. We derive the optimal power allocation that maximizes the achievable rate of the SU respecting power budget, interference, and relay power constraints. Numerical results highlight the cognitive rate gain of our proposed scheme with respect to various problem parameters. We also highlight the effect of UAV altitude on the SU and PU rates. Finally, when the relay matrix is optimized, we show that the PU rate is remarkably enhanced and that the SU rate is only improved at high-power regime.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2695586","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07904625.pdf","startPage":"5190","endPage":"5204","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2695586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achievable Rates of UAV-Relayed Cooperative Cognitive Radio MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7904625","topic":"Physical and Medium Access Control Layer Advances in 5G Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7904625/","displayDocTitle":"Achievable Rates of UAV-Relayed Cooperative Cognitive Radio MIMO Systems","volume":"5","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"16870816","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7904625/","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Achievable Rates of UAV-Relayed Cooperative Cognitive Radio MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"access-sboui-2695586-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119944S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Physical and Medium Access Control Layer Advances in 5G Wireless Networks"],"articleId":"7904625","onlineDate":"19 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7904627,"authors":[{"name":"Yiming Yu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7904627/yu-2692765-small.gif","p":["Yiming Yu was born in Zhejiang, China.

The LNA includes two branches in parallel: a common-source (CS) path and a common-gate (CG) path. The CS path is responsible for providing enough power gain, while the CG path is used to achieve the input impedance matching. To eliminate the noise contribution of the CG path, the noise cancellation technique is applied. Therefore, the overall noise figure (NF) is improved. The phase mismatch between the two paths is also quantitatively analyzed to investigate its effect on gain and NF. The analytical results agree well with the simulation results. The LNA has been fabricated by a commercial 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS process. The measurement results show that the LNA has achieved a maximum gain of 14.5 dB with 1.7-GHz 3-dB gain bandwidth and a minimum NF of 3 dB. The tested input 1-dB gain compression point (IP1 dB) is -10.4 dBm at 1 GHz and the input third-order intercept point is 0.25 dBm. With 1.8-V supply, the LNA draws only 6-mA dc current.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise measurement","Gain","Noise cancellation","Impedance matching","Power demand","Linearity","Transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","impedance matching","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit noise","low noise amplifiers","noise abatement","UHF amplifiers","UHF integrated circuits","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inductorless wideband low-noise amplifier","noise cancellation technique","LNA","common-source path","CS path","common-gate path","CG path","input impedance matching","noise contribution elimination","noise figure","NF","phase mismatch","CMOS process","gain 14.5 dB","frequency 1.7 GHz","gain 3 dB","noise figure 3 dB","gain 1 dB","frequency 1 GHz","voltage 1.8 V","current 6 mA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low-noise amplifier","inductorless","noise cancellation","phase mismatch","noise figure","CMOS","RFIC"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2692765","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07904627.pdf","startPage":"9389","endPage":"9397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2692765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and Design of Inductorless Wideband Low-Noise Amplifier With Noise Cancellation Technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7904627","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Design of Inductorless Wideband Low-Noise Amplifier With Noise Cancellation Technique","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7904627/","volume":"5","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","htmlLink":"/document/7904627/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16950484","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 April 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Fund of China","grantNumber":"61331006 and 61422104"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China","grantNumber":"2016ZX03001015-004"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2015AA01A704 and 2015AA7124068B"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Analysis and Design of Inductorless Wideband Low-Noise Amplifier With Noise Cancellation Technique","sourcePdf":"access-kang-2692765-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137237S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7904627","onlineDate":"19 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7904628,"authors":[{"name":"Baoping Cai","affiliation":["Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong","College of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, China University of Petroleum, Qingdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8059716/7904628/cai-2695583-small.gif","p":["Baoping Cai (M\u201915) received the B.S. degree in mechanical\n design, manufacturing and automation and the Ph.D. degree in mechanical and electronic engineering from the China\n University of Petroleum, Qingdao, China, in 2006 and 2012, respectively.","From 2013 to 2014, he was a Lecturer with the China University of Petroleum, where he is currently an Associate\n Professor, as well as a Hong Kong Scholar and a Postdoctoral Fellow with the City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon,\n Hong Kong.

Overall, our work can be divided into three folds. 1) Four models are designed to capture the properties of video summaries, i.e., containing important people and objects (importance), representative to the video content (representativeness), no similar key-shots (diversity), and smoothness of the storyline (storyness). Specifically, these models are applicable to both edited videos and raw videos. 2) A comprehensive score function is built with the weighted combination of the aforementioned four models. Note that the weights of the four models in the score function, denoted as property-weight, are learned in a supervised manner. Besides, the property-weights are learned for edited videos and raw videos, respectively. 3) The training set is constructed with both edited videos and raw videos in order to make up the lack of training data. Particularly, each training video is equipped with a pair of mixing-coefficients, which can reduce the structure mess in the training set caused by the rough mixture. We test our framework on three data sets, including edited videos, short raw videos, and long raw videos. Experimental results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2017.2695887","startPage":"3652","endPage":"3664","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

(SSVEPs) detection toward a high-speed brain-computer interface (BCI) speller. Methods: Task-related component analysis (TRCA), which can enhance reproducibility of SSVEPs across multiple trials, was employed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of SSVEP signals by removing background electroencephalographic (EEG) activities. An ensemble method was further developed to integrate TRCA filters corresponding to multiple stimulation frequencies. This study conducted a comparison of BCI performance between the proposed TRCA-based method and an extended canonical correlation analysis (CCA)-based method using a 40-class SSVEP dataset recorded from 12 subjects. An online BCI speller was further implemented using a cue-guided target selection task with 20 subjects and a free-spelling task with 10 of the subjects. Results: The offline comparison results indicate that the proposed TRCA-based approach can significantly improve the classification accuracy compared with the extended CCA-based method. Furthermore, the online BCI speller achieved averaged information transfer rates (ITRs) of 325.33 \u00b1 38.17 bits/min with the cue-guided task and 198.67 \u00b1 50.48 bits/min with the free-spelling task. Conclusion: This study validated the efficiency of the proposed TRCA-based method in implementing a high-speed SSVEP-based BCI. Significance: The high-speed SSVEP-based BCIs using the TRCA method have great potential for various applications in communication and control.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2017.2694818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8231804","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2017.2694818","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/8231804/07904641.pdf","startPage":"104","endPage":"112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing Detection of SSVEPs for a High-Speed Brain Speller Using Task-Related Component Analysis","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/10/8231804/7904641-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing Detection of SSVEPs for a High-Speed Brain Speller Using Task-Related Component Analysis","volume":"65","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7904641/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17447775","pubMedId":"28436836","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7904641/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006754","fundingName":"Army Research Laboratory","grantNumber":"(W911NF-10-2-0022)"},{"fundingName":"National Institute of Healths","grantNumber":"1R21EY025056-01"},{"fundingName":"Recruitment Program for Young Professionals and National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671424"},{"fundingName":"Young Talents Lift Project of Chinese Association of Science and Technology"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61603416"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Enhancing Detection of SSVEPs for a High-Speed Brain Speller Using Task-Related Component Analysis","sourcePdf":"tbme-wang-2694818-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101258S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"8231804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"8231804","articleId":"7904641","onlineDate":"19 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7904644,"authors":[{"name":"Ibrahim Shgluof","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic and System Engineering, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7904644/shglu-2695518-small.gif","p":["Ibrahim Shgluof received the B.Eng. degree in electronics and communication engineering from Manchester Polytechnic, U.K., in 1990, and the M.Eng. degree in computer and communications engineering from Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia in 2009, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

In particular, the use of femtocells seems to be the most feasible solution for hotspot areas where high traffic is concentrated. However, femtocell densification will face a number of technical challenges. Among others, the co-tier interference arises as an old acquaintance with a new significance. In point of fact, the interference characteristics and the role of aggressor and victim depend on a large extent on the density scenario, especially when femtocells share the same channel and operate in a Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) mode. In this regard, identification of victim and aggressor femtocells is a prerequisite to design an effective interference management scheme for ultra-dense femtocell networks (UDFNs). This paper implements a new approach for radio resource utilization and management for victim femtocells in an ultra-dense network environment. The proposed semi-clustering of victim-cell (SCVC) approach focuses mainly on users' status whether critical or non-critical to categorize victim femtocells and their aggressors. After identifying the victim femtocells, the SCVC scheme semi-cluster each victim femtocell based on the status of each user. Then, it smartly allocates the appropriate radio resources in a dynamic manner, which allows ranging from shared use of resources for critical users to the frequency reuse one for non-critical users, thereby ensuring minimum co-tier interference and enhancement of spectrum efficiency. Simulation results show that our approach outperforms one of the prominent related schemes, namely, femtocell cluster based resource allocation (FCRA), in terms of the mean throughput of critical users, the average capacity of victim femtocells, and the percentage of resource utilization by an approximate average gain of 185%, 64%, and 31%, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2695518","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07904644.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2695518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","startPage":"9032","endPage":"9043","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-Clustering of Victim-Cells Approach for Interference Management in Ultra-Dense Femtocell Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7904644","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Semi-Clustering of Victim-Cells Approach for Interference Management in Ultra-Dense Femtocell Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7904644/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 April 2017","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"16950549","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7904644/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Semi-Clustering of Victim-Cells Approach for Interference Management in Ultra-Dense Femtocell Networks","sourcePdf":"access-shgluof-2695518-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.16686S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7904644","onlineDate":"19 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7904647,"authors":[{"name":"Nicola Bui","affiliation":["IMDEA Networks Institute, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/8013866/7904647/bui-2694140-small.gif","p":["Nicola Bui is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the University Carlos III of Madrid and a Research Engineer with IMDEA Networks.

Anticipatory networking extends the idea to communication technologies by studying patterns and periodicity in human behavior and network dynamics to optimize network performance. This survey collects and analyzes recent papers leveraging context information to forecast the evolution of network conditions and, in turn, to improve network performance. In particular, we identify the main prediction and optimization tools adopted in this body of work and link them with objectives and constraints of the typical applications and scenarios.

An analog phase detector, capable of detecting a maximum range of \u00b190\u00b0, has been used to perform a double multiplication of two signals, both in-phase and phase-shifted. The proposed solution broadens the frequency range beyond other solutions that require to fulfill the quadrature condition. Subsequently, the possibility of reaching the theoretical limit of phase shift within a hybrid coupler ($\\varphi$ <;90\u00b0 \u00b1 90\u00b0) is discussed by using four straight-line equations to characterize the phase detector response. The proposed solution allows to extend up to 360\u00b0 the phase detection range and provide an increased immunity with respect to both impedance mismatching and phase deviations within the hybrid coupler. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed design, a phase detector cell prototype has been implemented using a commercial hybrid coupler with a phase shift of 92.5\u00b0 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0 at 3.1-5.9 GHz, an external switch and a microcontroller with 2 kB of memory. Measurements show a range of detection of 360\u00b0 (\u00b1180\u00b0) across the tested frequency band of 2.7-6 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2017.2690841","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7260/7921541/07904653.pdf","startPage":"503","endPage":"505","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2017.2690841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7921541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"360\u00b0 Phase Detector Cell for Measurement Systems Based on Switched Dual Multipliers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"360\u00b0 Phase Detector Cell for Measurement Systems Based on Switched Dual Multipliers","volume":"27","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16865494","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7904653/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7904653/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Spanish Government","grantNumber":"TEC2011-29264-C03-02 TEC2014-60283-C3-2-R Project"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"360\u00b0 Phase Detector Cell for Measurement Systems Based on Switched Dual Multipliers","sourcePdf":"lmwc-perez-2690841-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04804S","chronDate":"May  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"7921541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7921541","articleId":"7904653","onlineDate":"19 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7904657,"authors":[{"name":"Yujun Shu","affiliation":["Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yujun","lastName":"Shu","orcid":"0000-0003-2936-8397","id":"37086083716"},{"name":"Fengyi Mei","affiliation":["Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Fengyi","lastName":"Mei","orcid":"0000-0003-4496-2992","id":"37086076069"},{"name":"Youling Yu","affiliation":["Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Youling","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086079421"},{"name":"Jiangfeng Wu","affiliation":["Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jiangfeng","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086353803"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7904657","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1680},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7904657","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Decoding","Latches","Multiplexing","Delay lines","Power demand","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","asynchronous circuits","CMOS digital integrated circuits","comparators (circuits)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous digital slope ADC","power supply","improved delay cells","delay time","strong-arm comparator","SMIC CMOS technology","single-channel asynchronous digital slope analog-to-digital converter","self-disabled continuous-time comparator","signal-to-noise and distortion ratio","sampling speed","voltage 1.2 V","time 50.0 ps","word length 5 bit","size 55 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asynchronous","digital slope","delay cell","self-disabled comparator","continuous-time comparator","strong-arm comparator"]}],"abstract":"In this brief, we design a single-channel 5-bit 500-MS/s asynchronous digital slope analog-to-digital converter.

Several utilization-based power models have been proposed for measuring the energy consumption of locally running programs. However, the main challenge of utilization-based methods is that the models must be retrained for program units that use hardware components not addressed in the training phase. This paper proposes a paired sampling-based power model to address this critical challenge. The proposed power model estimates the energy consumption of an OSGi service asynchronously invoked in a multithreading environment on the basis of the overall remaining battery energy information at runtime without a connected power meter or energy profile for each specific hardware component of different devices. On the basis of the power model, an offloading decision model is proposed to dynamically determine whether a service invocation should be offloaded to a nearby mobile device over Bluetooth to conserve energy. The proposed approach was experimentally assessed regarding the correctness of decision making, energy gained by offloading service invocations, and weighted absolute percentage error of the estimated energy consumption compared with actual one.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","Mobile handsets","Servers","Hardware","Batteries","Power measurement","Energy measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","energy consumption","mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weighted absolute percentage error","offloading service invocation","decision making correctness","Bluetooth","mobile device","service invocation","offloading decision model","specific hardware component","battery energy information","multithreading environment","OSGi service","paired sampling-based power model","training phase","hardware components","utilization-based method","locally-running programs","utilization-based power model","mobile devices","energy consumption","program-offloading decision making","dynamic mobile-to-mobile service offloading","energy-aware paired sampling-based decision model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Offloading decision model","power model","mobile-to-mobile service offloading","energy-aware decision making"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2695618","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07904663.pdf","startPage":"5031","endPage":"5045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2695618","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Aware Paired Sampling-Based Decision Model for Dynamic Mobile-to-Mobile Service Offloading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7904663","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Aware Paired Sampling-Based Decision Model for Dynamic Mobile-to-Mobile Service Offloading","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7904663/","volume":"5","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","htmlLink":"/document/7904663/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16870770","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 April 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"105-2221-E-006-154-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Energy-Aware Paired Sampling-Based Decision Model for Dynamic Mobile-to-Mobile Service Offloading","sourcePdf":"access-lee-2695618-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092025S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7904663","onlineDate":"19 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7904665,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Reversible circuit (RC) design is a promising future domain in computing which provides the benefit of less computational power. With the increase in the number of gates and input variables, the circuits become complex and the need for fault testing becomes crucial in ensuring high reliability of their operation. Various fault detection methods based on exhaustive test vector search approaches have been proposed in the literature. With increase in circuit complexity, a faster test generation method for providing optimal coverage becomes desirable. In this paper, a genetic algorithm-based heuristic test set generation method for fault detection in RCs is proposed which avoids the need for an exhaustive search. Two approaches, one involving random search and the other, involving directed search have been proposed and validated on benchmark circuits considering missing-gate fault (complete and partial), bridging fault and stuck-at fault with optimum coverage and reduced computational efforts.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2017.2695881","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/8263325/07904665.pdf","startPage":"324","endPage":"336","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of

precision agriculture, resource managing, urban characterization, disaster and emergency response, etc. However, due to limitations in the spectral, spatial, and temporal resolution of EO sensors, there are many situations in which remote sensing data cannot be fully exploited, particularly in the context of emergency response (i.e., applications in which real/near-real-time response is needed). Recently, with the rapid development and availability of social media data, new opportunities have become available to complement and fill the gaps in remote sensing data for emergency response. In this paper, we provide an overview on the integration of social media and remote sensing in time-critical applications. First, we revisit the most recent advances in the integration of social media and remote sensing data. Then, we describe several practical case studies and examples addressing the use of social media data to improve remote sensing data and/or techniques for emergency response.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2017.2684460","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/8045830/07904672.pdf","startPage":"1900","endPage":"1912","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8045830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2017.2684460","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/07904672.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Social Media: New Perspectives to Improve Remote Sensing for Emergency Response","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7904672","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Social Media: New Perspectives to Improve Remote Sensing for Emergency Response","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7904672/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17192730","htmlLink":"/document/7904672/","volume":"105","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 April 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Guangdong Provincial Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2016A030313254"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41501368, 41522104 and 41531178"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"16lgpy04"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Social Media: New Perspectives to Improve Remote Sensing for Emergency Response","sourcePdf":"jproc-he-2684460-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.335725S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"8045830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8045830","articleId":"7904672","onlineDate":"19 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7904673,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7904673/lwang-2694963-small.gif","p":["Lin Wang received the M.E. degree in information and communication engineering from the Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China, in 2009.

Meanwhile, energy harvesting (EH) is an increasingly attractive source of power for green networks. In this paper, we study an online strategy of adaptive traffic offloading and bandwidth allocation for EH IoT networks, where machines are powered by grid and green energy jointly. First, we study the energy-aware and adaptive traffic offloading strategy to adaptively balance the non-uniform renewable energy arriving, with the purpose of minimizing the average on-grid energy consumption. Furthermore, the bandwidth allocation strategy to maximize the average sum-rate is proposed. Finally, we validate this paper by simulations and show that the proposed strategy can achieve 55% reduction of the average on-grid energy consumption and over 100% increase of the average sum-rate.","topic":"Exploiting the Benefits of Interference in Wireless Networks: Energy Harvesting and Security","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7904673/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7904673/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"16870708","volume":"5","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Online Strategy of Adaptive Traffic Offloading and Bandwidth Allocation for Green M2M Communications","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61372114, 61571054 and 61631005"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005090","fundingName":"New Star in Science and Technology of Beijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission through the Beijing Nova Program","grantNumber":"Z151100000315077"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"An Online Strategy of Adaptive Traffic Offloading and Bandwidth Allocation for Green M2M Communications","sourcePdf":"access-wang-2694963-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062504S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Exploiting the Benefits of Interference in Wireless Networks: Energy Harvesting and Security"],"articleId":"7904673","onlineDate":"19 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":7904674,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Computer Integrated Manufacturing System, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7904674/liu-2693380-small.gif","p":["Qiang Liu received the B.S. degree from Xi\u2019an Ploytechnic University, the M.S. degree from the Guangdong University of Technology, and the Ph.D. degree from SunYat-Sen University.

This paper presents an access control model for resource sharing based on the role-based access control intended for multidomain MIoT. In multidomain systems, in order to response on the assigning request for permission for the certain role from the certain user, an authority action sequence named the authorization route is employed to determine an appropriate authorization state. In this paper, the best authorization route with the least spread of permissions is defined as an optimal authorization route. We employed an intelligent planning theory to model the authorization route problem and to develop a solution algorithm called PGAO*, which can support external evaluation of both single-goal-role authorization routes and multi-goal-role authorization routes. In addition, some simple policies for solving the authorization route problem are presented. The proposed access control model provides a quick and efficient authorization decision support for administrators in collaborative domain and ensures a secure access in resource sharing in

Thus, we show that artificial synapses can achieve the richness observed in biology as well as a range of STDP timescales for biologically compatible to accelerated neural network applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7904675/","volume":"38","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7904675/","accessionNumber":"16899078","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Arbitrary Spike Time Dependent Plasticity (STDP) in Memristor by Analog Waveform Engineering","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001843","fundingName":"Science and Engineering Research Board"},{"fundingName":"Department of Science and Technology"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001843","fundingName":"Department of Electronics and IT, Government of India"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arbitrary Spike Time Dependent Plasticity (STDP) in Memristor by Analog Waveform Engineering","sourcePdf":"led-panwar-2696023-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09729S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"7932562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7932562","articleId":"7904675","onlineDate":"19 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7904676,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Cheng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/8002781/7904676/Cheng-2696008-small.gif","p":["Xiang Cheng received the PhD degree in computer science from the\n Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, in 2013.

Recently, with accumulation of users and contents, much concern has arisen over the efficiency and answer quality of CQA services. To address this problem, question routing has been proposed which aims at routing new questions to suitable answerers, who have both high possibility and high ability to answer the questions. In this paper, we formulate question routing as a multi-objective ranking problem, and present a multi-objective learning-to-rank approach for question routing (MLQR), which can simultaneously optimize the answering possibility and answer quality of routed users. In MLQR, realizing that questions are relatively short and usually attached with tags, we first propose a tagword topic model (TTM) to derive topical representations of questions. Based on TTM, we then develop features for each question-user pair, which are captured at both platform level and thread level. In particular, the platform-level features summarize the information of a user from his/her history posts in the CQA platform, while the thread-level features model the pairwise competitions of a user with others in his/her answered threads. Finally, we extend a state-of-the-art learning-to-rank algorithm for training a multi-objective ranking model. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets show that our MLQR can outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of both answering possibility and answer quality.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2017.2696008","startPage":"1779","endPage":"1792","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/69/8002781/07904676.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2017.2696008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8002781","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi-Objective Optimization Approach for Question Routing in Community Question Answering Services","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Training","Feature extraction","Knowledge discovery","Optimization","History","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","optimisation","question answering (information retrieval)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective optimization approach","community question answering services","CQA services","multiobjective ranking problem","multiobjective learning-to-rank approach for question routing","MLQR","tagword topic model","TTM","platform-level features","thread-level features"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Community question answering services","question routing","multiple-objective optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7904676/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Multi-Objective Optimization Approach for Question Routing in Community Question Answering Services","volume":"29","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7904676/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2017","accessionNumber":"17132618","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61502047"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multi-Objective Optimization Approach for Question Routing in Community Question Answering Services","sourcePdf":"tkde-cheng-2696008-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132644S","chronDate":"Sept. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"8002781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8002781","articleId":"7904676","onlineDate":"19 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7904689,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Zhao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding, International Research Center of Intelligent Perception and Computation, Ministry of Education of China, School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7955031/7904689/wzhao-2689018-small.gif","p":["Wei Zhao received the B.S. degree in Electronic Engineering from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of Ministry of Education of China.","His research interests include deep learning, object detection, and image understanding."]},"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhao","orcid":"0000-0002-3575-473X","id":"37085377562"},{"name":"Licheng Jiao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding, International Research Center of Intelligent Perception and Computation, Ministry of Education of China, School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7955031/7904689/jiao-2689018-small.gif","p":["Licheng Jiao (SM\u201989) received the B.S. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 1982, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 1984 and 1990, respectively.","Since 1992, he has been a Professor with the School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, where he is currently the Director of the Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of the Ministry of Education of China.

However, it is still a challenging task to fuse and classify these VHR images. Generally, there are two ways for the fusion and classification of panchromatic and MS images. One way is to use a panchromatic image to sharpen an MS image, and then classify a pan-sharpened MS image. Another way is to extract features from panchromatic and MS images, respectively, and then combine these features for classification. In this paper, we propose a superpixel-based multiple local convolution neural network (SML-CNN) model for panchromatic and MS images classification. In order to reduce the amount of input data for the CNN, we extend simple linear iterative clustering algorithm for segmenting MS images and generating superpixels. Superpixels are taken as the basic analysis unit instead of pixels. To make full advantage of the spatial-spectral and environment information of superpixels, a superpixel-based multiple local regions joint representation method is proposed. Then, an SML-CNN model is established to extract an efficient joint feature representation. A softmax layer is used to classify these features learned by multiple local CNN into different categories. Finally, in order to eliminate the adverse effects on the classification results within and between superpixels, we propose a multi-information modification strategy that combines the detailed information and semantic information to improve the classification performance. Experiments on the classification of Vancouver and Xi'an panchromatic and MS image data sets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7955031/07904689.pdf","startPage":"4141","endPage":"4156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Superpixel-Based Multiple Local CNN for Panchromatic and Multispectral Image Classification","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2017.2689018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7955031","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2017.2689018","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7904689","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7904689/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","displayDocTitle":"Superpixel-Based Multiple Local CNN for Panchromatic and Multispectral Image Classification","dateOfInsertion":"22 June 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"16965453","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7904689/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program (973 Program) of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329402"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Major Research Plan of the National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"91438201 and 91438103"},{"fundingName":"Fund for Foreign Scholars in University Research and Teaching Programs (the 111 Project)","grantNumber":"B07048"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Superpixel-Based Multiple Local CNN for Panchromatic and Multispectral Image Classification","sourcePdf":"tgrs-zhao-2689018-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.174381S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7955031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"7955031","articleId":"7904689","onlineDate":"19 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7904692,"authors":[{"name":"Satheesh Bojja Venkatakrishnan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/8094487/7904692/bojja-2690451-small.gif","p":["Satheesh Bojja Venkatakrishnan (M\u201998) was born in Tiruchirappalli, India, in 1987.

Concurrently, advances in digital technology and signal processing have drastically reduced digital beamforming complexity. Recently, a novel on-site coding receiver (OSCR) architecture was proposed to significantly reduce hardware requirement for digital beamforming. Using OSCR, the signal from each antenna element is encoded, then several of these signals are grouped and digitized using a single analog-to-digital converter. Doing so, hardware requirements are drastically reduced. At the digital back-end, field programmable gate arrays are used to decorrelate and recover the signals associated with each array element for beamforming. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the OSCR concept by building and testing a multichannel receiver using commercialoff-the-shelf components.

Users request files independently at random according to an a-priori known demand distribution q. A coding scheme for this network consists of two phases: cache placement and delivery. The cache placement is a mapping of the library files onto the user caches that can be optimized as a function of the demand statistics, but is agnostic of the actual demand realization. After the user demands are revealed, during the delivery phase the source sends a codeword (function of the library files, cache placement, and demands) to the users, such that each user retrieves its requested file with arbitrarily high probability. The goal is to minimize the average transmission length of the delivery phase, referred to as rate (expressed in channel symbols per file). In the case of deterministic demands, the optimal min-max rate has been characterized within a constant multiplicative factor, independent of the network parameters. The case of random demands was previously addressed by applying the order-optimal min-max scheme separately within groups of files requested with similar probability. However, no complete characterization of order-optimality was previously provided for random demands under the average rate performance criterion. In this paper, we consider the random demand setting and, for the special yet relevant case of a Zipf demand distribution, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the order-optimal rate for all regimes of the system parameters, as well as an explicit placement and delivery scheme achieving order-optimal rates. We present also numerical results that confirm the superiority of our scheme with respect to previously proposed schemes for the same setting.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2017.2695611","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2017.2695611","startPage":"3923","endPage":"3949","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7931776/07904696.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7931776","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Order-Optimal Rate of Caching and Coded Multicasting With Random Demands","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/18/7931776/7904696-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7904696/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Order-Optimal Rate of Caching and Coded Multicasting With Random Demands","volume":"63","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16898602","publicationDate":"June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7904696/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004381","fundingName":"Intel, Cisco, and Verizon through the VAWN Project"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF 1161801"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Order-Optimal Rate of Caching and Coded Multicasting With Random Demands","sourcePdf":"tit-caire-2695611-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.267021S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7931776","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"7931776","articleId":"7904696","onlineDate":"19 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7904697,"authors":[{"name":"Hengjing Liang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China","Beijing Institute of Satellite Information Engineering, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7904697/liang-2693441-small.gif","p":["Hengjing Liang received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2010, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in communication and information systems with the National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications.

The throughput maximization problem over infinite time horizon for the considered system is investigated, considering the extra power consumption by the circuits during transmissions. The optimal power allocation is obtained by examining two cases on whether the relay can support the source transmissions, and is then shown to be with an \u201con-off\u201d structure, i.e., the source and the relay transmit with certain probabilities, respectively. Next, the dynamics of the stored data at the relay is modeled under the derived optimal power allocation, and the minimum buffer size required for data storage is quantified. Finally, numerical results validate the analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7904697/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2017","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2017","accessionNumber":"16904554","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7904697/","displayDocTitle":"Throughput Maximization for Buffer-Aided Decode-and-Forward Relay Channels With Non-Ideal Circuit Power","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China Major Project","grantNumber":"61631004"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501093 and 61401030"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Throughput Maximization for Buffer-Aided Decode-and-Forward Relay Channels With Non-Ideal Circuit Power","sourcePdf":"access-huang-2693441-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119205S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7904697","onlineDate":"19 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7904703,"authors":[{"name":"Yuli Zhang","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Communication Networks Laboratory, Shijiazhuang, China","College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7904703/zhang-2696025-small.gif","p":["Yuli Zhang received the B.S. degree in electronic and information engineering from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2012, and the M.S. degree from the College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2015, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

Since ubiquitous fiber availability is prohibitively expensive, wireless backhaul technique via millimeter wave (mmWave) is regarded as a practical solution. Additionally, mmWave with huge under-utilized bandwidth is able to provide multi-Gbps data rate comparable to fiber lines. In this paper, we propose an mmWave hierarchical small cell base station backhauling (mw-HierBack) system to organize densely deployed base stations (BSs) in HetNet. A group of Super-BSs (S-BSs) are selected to minimize the resource cost on the gateways and to robustly relay backhaul traffic of the remaining BSs to the core network against any blockage or link failure. Under this network structure, we present a path protection strategy to balance backhaul traffic among S-BSs and to minimize the fluctuations incurred by rerouting. The simulation results show our solution can efficiently scale with the growth of BSs and properly route the backhaul traffic without overloading any one of the S-BSs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Logic gates","Interference","5G mobile communication","Delays","Mobile computing","Robustness","Millimeter wave communication","Heterogeneous networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","radio links","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiGbps data rate","mmWave hierarchical small cell base station backhauling","mw-HierBack","densely deployed base stations","backhaul traffic","core network","network structure","HetNets dense deployments","heterogeneous networks","spectral efficiency","ubiquitous fiber availability","wireless backhaul technique","S-BS","super-BS","robust millimeter wave hierarchical backhaul solution","link failure.","S"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Millimeter wave networks","in-band backhaul","heterogeneous networks","path protection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMC.2017.2696011","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/8094205/07904705.pdf","startPage":"3445","endPage":"3458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8094205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2017.2696011","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"mw-HierBack: A Cost-Effective and Robust Millimeter Wave Hierarchical Backhaul Solution for HetNets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7904705","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"mw-HierBack: A Cost-Effective and Robust Millimeter Wave Hierarchical Backhaul Solution for HetNets","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7904705/","volume":"16","issue":"12","publicationDate":"1 Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7904705/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17352755","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 1 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 April 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001869","fundingName":"Academia Sinica","grantNumber":"AS-104-TP-A05"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001868","fundingName":"National Science Council (NSC)","grantNumber":"MOST 104-2221-E-002-081-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"mw-HierBack: A Cost-Effective and Robust Millimeter Wave Hierarchical Backhaul Solution for HetNets","sourcePdf":"tmc-liao-2696011-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144439S","chronDate":"Dec. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"8094205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8094205","articleId":"7904705","onlineDate":"19 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7904707,"authors":[{"name":"Mathews Boby","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8126282/7904707/boby-2695660-small.gif","p":["Mathews Boby (S\u201915) received the B.Tech. degree in electronics\n and communication engineering from the Mar Athanasius College of Engineering, Kothamangalam, India, in 2010, and the\n M.Tech. degree in electronic systems engineering, in 2014, from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India,\n where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electronic Systems Engineering.","His research interests include power converters and drives."]},"firstName":"Mathews","lastName":"Boby","orcid":"0000-0001-5738-8972","id":"37085800421"},{"name":"Arun Rahul S.","affiliation":["ABB, Chennai, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8126282/7904707/rahul-2695660-small.gif","p":["Arun Rahul S received the B.Tech. degree from the Rajiv Gandhi\n Institute of Technology, Kottayam, India, in 2008, and the M.Tech. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology,\n Kharagpur, India, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electronics Systems Engineering, Indian\n Institute of Science, Bangalore, India, in 2016, all in electrical engineering.","He is currently with ABB, Chennai, India.

In the overmodulation range, the hexagonal space vector structure generates low-order harmonics in the phase voltage resulting in low-order torque ripple in the motor. Inverter topologies with an octadecagonal (18 sided) space vector structure eliminate fifth-, seventh-, eleventh-, and thirteenth-order harmonics from the phase voltage, and hence, the dominant sixth- and twelfth-order torque ripple generation is eliminated. Octadecagonal space vector structures proposed in the past require multiple dc sources, which makes four-quadrant operation of the drive system difficult and costly. In this paper, the formation of a multilevel nine-concentric octadecagonal space vector structure using a single dc source is proposed. Detailed experimental results, using open-loop V/f control and rotor field-oriented control, are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed drive scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2017.2695660","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8126282/07904707.pdf","startPage":"2430","endPage":"2437","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2017.2695660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8126282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low-Order Harmonic Elimination Scheme for Induction Motor Drives Using a Multilevel Octadecagonal Space Vector Structure With a Single DC Source","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7904707","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/63/8126282/7904707-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7904707/","displayDocTitle":"A Low-Order Harmonic Elimination Scheme for Induction Motor Drives Using a Multilevel Octadecagonal Space Vector Structure With a Single DC Source","volume":"33","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17427521","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7904707/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"A Low-Order Harmonic Elimination Scheme for Induction Motor Drives Using a Multilevel Octadecagonal Space Vector Structure With a Single DC Source","sourcePdf":"tpel-gopakumar-2695660-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07358S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8126282","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8126282","articleId":"7904707","onlineDate":"19 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7904708,"authors":[{"name":"Sui Tang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Sui Tang received the M.S. degree in Mathematics from Vanderbilt Universi in 2013 and the PhD degree in Mathematics from Vanderbilt University in 2016.

This paper aims to investigate joint design of user association and power allocation with loads constraint and transmit power constraint for the massive MIMO HetNets by considering proportional fairness about the spectral efficiency under imperfect channel state information. First, we derive a closed-form lower bound on the ergodic spectral efficiency with linear zero-forcing beamforming, based on which, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem is formulated. It is difficult to efficiently obtain an exact solution since it is non-convex and combinational. To solve this NP-hard problem, an effective algorithm with guaranteed convergence is proposed, where the original problem is decomposed into the corresponding subproblems, which can be solved by low complexity approaches, respectively. Numerical results show that how the number of antennas and the number of BSs affect the spectral efficiency, and our proposed algorithm outperforms other algorithms in terms of the spectral efficiency and load balancing.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07904713.pdf","startPage":"6560","endPage":"6569","publicationTitle":"IEEE

The impact of this empirical deficiency in spectral resource management has been aggravated by the exploding content consumption over wireless networks, and this has led to calls for additional remedies. In 5G standards, device-to-device (D2D) communications and heterogeneous wireless networks are posed as two vital apparatus to alleviate this capacity crunch. In this letter, we consider such an environment and analyze content delivery over satellite integrated CR networks. We propose a novel state-based and event-driven system model and investigate its behavior.

This is accomplished by using a uniform circular antenna array whose elements are individually connected to the radiofrequency (RF) front end of a neoteric radio. This technique is utilized to spatially and spectrally separate the communication signals of interest from the strong interfering signals without a priori knowledge regarding their DoAs. Through an extensive comparison with the other techniques reported in the literature, it is shown that ASSIA can detect the DoAs and signal levels of wide dynamic range (DR) much more accurately than what can be done with the existing techniques, provided that the signals' angular spacing is larger than the array beamwidth. Array calibration to capture the fabrication errors is essential to achieve the high level of the DR of signals that ASSIA can handle. The performance of the algorithm in the presence of strong jammers in complex multipath environments with Rayleigh fading characteristics is examined using numerical simulations based on an accurate ray-tracing propagation model. A statistical analysis based on Monte Carlo simulations shows that in such an environment, an ASSIA radio with a 12-element uniform circular array can improve the signal-to-jammer ratio (SJR) from -20 to at least +2 dB (minimum of 22-dB improvement) in more than 70% of occasions.","doi":"10.1109/MAP.2016.2630034","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation

mapping scheme for distributed controller architectures in software defined networks. Our scheme maps a switch to multiple controllers and distributes flow setup requests among them to minimize flow setup time, satisfying the resilience constraint, which requires that a specified fraction of setup requests at each switch is not affected upon a controller failure. We develop an optimization formulation for the problem and compare our scheme against the single controller mapping. The results show that our scheme reduces flow setup time, provides better fairness among switches and that it is more stable against dynamic traffic fluctuations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7904722/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","volume":"21","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"17099407","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7904722/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On Multiple Controller Mapping in Software Defined Networks With Resilience Constraints","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Singapore MoE AcRF Tier-2","grantNumber":"MOE2015-T2-2-116 and NUS WBS R-263-000-C17-112"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Multiple Controller Mapping in Software Defined Networks With Resilience Constraints","sourcePdf":"lcomm-sridharan-2696006-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05852S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8007375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8007375","articleId":"7904722","onlineDate":"19 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7904730,"authors":[{"name":"R\u00e9da Boumchedda","affiliation":["University of Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France","STMicroelectronics, Crolles, France","CEA-LETI, MINATEC Campus, Grenoble, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7990278/7904730/boumc-2688862-small.gif","p":["R\u00e9da Boumchedda was born in Lyon, France, in 1991.

The 4T SRAM bitcell has been characterized to investigate the critical operations in terms of stability (retention and read) taking into account the post-layout parasitic elements. Thus, failure mechanisms are exposed and explained. Based on this paper, a data-dependent dynamic back-biasing scheme improving the bitcell stability is developed. A specific read-assist circuit is also proposed in order to enable a large number of bitcells per column in a memory array.

Spectrum sharing among heterogeneous networks is a fundamental issue that determines network performance. Previous works have focused on a \u201cdynamic spectrum access\u201d mode associated with the cognitive radio technology. These works all focused on the discovery of available spectrum resource either in the time domain or in the frequency domain, i.e., by separating different users' transmission. To initiate a new paradigm of spectrum sharing, the unique characteristics of the technologies should be utilized in the next-generation networks. The 5G networks are featured either by wide bandwidth like mm-wave systems, or by large-scale antennas like massive MIMO. Those two trends can lead to a common phenomenon: the spatial focusing effect. Based on this focusing effect, we propose a general spatial spectrum sharing framework that enables concurrent multi-users spectrum sharing without the requirement of orthogonal resource allocation. Moreover, we design two general network association protocols either in a centralized manner or in a distributed manner. Simulation results show that both the time reversal wideband and the massive MIMO system can achieve high throughput performance with the spatial spectrum sharing scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7904733/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7904733/","dateOfInsertion":"11 July 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17026591","volume":"16","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Exploring Spatial Focusing Effect for Spectrum Sharing and Network Association","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring Spatial Focusing Effect for Spectrum Sharing and Network Association","sourcePdf":"twc-jiang-2694832-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114224S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7973115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7973115","articleId":"7904733","onlineDate":"19 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7904736,"authors":[{"name":"Hucheng Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, China Academy of Telecommunications Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8039128/7904736/wang-2695799-small.gif","p":["Hucheng Wang received the M.S. degree in 2008 from Beijing University\n of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with\n Communication and Information Systems.

However, due to its new characteristics such as high dense small cells, fast and flexible deployment of small cell access points, and flexible backhaul connectivity, how to enable mobility support is becoming a great challenge. In this paper, based on newly proposed network architectures for UDN, we present two efficient localized mobility management schemes considering small cell deployments and backhaul topology. The first one centralizes mobility management control from small cell access points into a local access server (LAS) closing to radio access network. Another one allows individual small cell access points to handle mobility events, but still requires the LAS to act as mobility anchor. According to the performance evaluation results of the proposed schemes by using numerical analysis and simulation, respectively, including average handover signaling cost, average packet delivery cost, average handover latency, and average signaling load to the core network, the localized mobility management with centralized control scheme has the best performance, and the other one has less handover signaling cost, but higher handover latency than the third-generation partnership project (3GPP) scheme.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handover","Network architecture","5G mobile communication","Topology","3GPP"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","mobility management (mobile radio)","numerical analysis","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["localized mobility management","5G ultra dense network","high-speed data rate","fifth-generation network","high dense small cells","small cell access points","flexible backhaul connectivity","local access server","radio access network","numerical analysis","numerical simulation","handover signaling cost","average packet delivery cost","average handover latency","average signaling load","third-generation partnership project","3GPP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fifth-generation (5G)","handover","mobility management","ultra dense network (UDN)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2695799","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8039128/07904736.pdf","startPage":"8535","endPage":"8552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8039128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2695799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Localized Mobility Management for 5G Ultra Dense Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7904736","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Localized Mobility Management for 5G Ultra Dense Network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7904736/","volume":"66","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7904736/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17188076","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 April 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project of China","grantNumber":"2016ZX03001_002_004 and 2017ZX03001014"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61425012"},{"fundingName":"National High-Technology Program (863) of China","grantNumber":"2015AA01A706"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Localized Mobility Management for 5G Ultra Dense Network","sourcePdf":"tvt-wang-2695799-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130345S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8039128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8039128","articleId":"7904736","onlineDate":"19 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7904740,"authors":[{"name":"Tae H.

The dual neural network, as a special type of recurrent neural networks that are inherently parallel processing models, is widely investigated in past decades to control manipulators. However, to the best of our knowledge, existing dual neural networks require a full knowledge about manipulator parameters for efficient control. We make progress along this direction in this paper by proposing a novel model-free dual neural network, which is able to address the learning and control of manipulators simultaneously in a unified framework. Different from pure learning problems, the interplay of the control part and the learning part allows us to inject an additive noise into the control channel to increase the richness of signals for the purpose of efficient learning. Due to a deliberate design, the learning error is guaranteed for convergence to zero despite the existence of additive noise for stimulation. Theoretical analysis reveals the global stability of the proposed neural network control system. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme for redundancy resolution of a PUMA 560 manipulator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7904747/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 April 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18628244","volume":"49","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7904747/","publicationDate":"May 2019","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Dynamic Neural Network Approach for Efficient Control of Manipulators","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572331"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dynamic Neural Network Approach for Efficient Control of Manipulators","sourcePdf":"tsmc-li-2690460-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119908S","chronDate":"May  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"8691626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8691626","articleId":"7904747","onlineDate":"19 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7904749,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Feng","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Feng","orcid":"0000-0002-3356-9135","id":"37086054511"},{"name":"Shuguo Li","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shuguo","lastName":"Li","id":"37405422500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"7904749","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":931},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7904749","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Algorithm design and analysis","Very large scale integration","Complexity theory","Field programmable gate arrays","Discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design","multiplying circuits","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["area-efficient million-bit integer multiplier","double modulus NTT","double modulus number theoretical transform","million-bit integer multiplication","fully homomorphic encryption","Chinese reminder theorem","double modulus method","VLSI design","Sch\u00f6nhage-Strassen algorithm","Altera Stratix-V FPGA","word length 24 bit to 32 bit","time 4.9 ms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)","large integer multiplication","number theoretical transform (NTT)"]}],"abstract":"This brief proposes a double modulus number theoretical transform (NTT) method for million-bit integer multiplication in fully homomorphic encryption.

Implementation results on Altera Stratix-V FPGA show that this brief is able to compute a product of two 1024k-bit integers every 4.9 ms at the cost of only 7.9k ALUTs and 3.6k registers, which is more area-efficient when compared with the current competitors.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2017.2691727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8015212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2017.2691727","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/8015212/07904749.pdf","startPage":"2658","endPage":"2662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of an Area-Effcient Million-Bit Integer Multiplier Using Double Modulus NTT","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Design of an Area-Effcient Million-Bit Integer Multiplier Using Double Modulus NTT","volume":"25","issue":"9","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7904749/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17135587","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7904749/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61674086"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of an Area-Effcient Million-Bit Integer Multiplier Using Double Modulus NTT","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-feng-2691727-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065606S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8015212","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8015212","articleId":"7904749","onlineDate":"19 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7904869,"authors":[{"name":"Syafaruddin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universitas Hasanuddin, Makassar, Indonesia"],"lastName":"Syafaruddin","id":"37086039853"},{"name":"Salama Manjang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universitas Hasanuddin, Makassar, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Salama","lastName":"Manjang","id":"37828642000"},{"name":"Satriani Latief","affiliation":["Department of Architecture, Universitas Bosowa, Makassar, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Satriani","lastName":"Latief","id":"37086045131"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5108-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5109-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7904869","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power measurement","Integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load forecasting","power engineering computing","probability","radial basis function networks","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radial basis function neural network","RBF neural network","short term load forecasting","probability","statistical assumption","intelligent technique","artificial neural network","locally-tuned response biological neuron","estimation process","Makassar City","Indonesia","mean absolute percentage error","MAPE","least square polynomial approximation method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["short term","load forecasting","intelligent methods","RBF","neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7904869","abstract":"Providing solution for short term load forecasting is a major challenge remained for researchers due to the nature characteristics of load which are non-linear, probabilistic and uncertainty. As the statistical assumption may fail to estimate the load profile precisely, the intelligent techniques play important role to provide alternative solutions. This paper discusses the variant of artificial neural network called radial basis function (RBF) neural network for short term load forecasting. The method is recently attracted attention due to structure simplicity and high identification performance. The RBF method is an artificial neural network model motivated by locally-tuned response biological neurons that provide selective response characteristics for some finite range of the input signal space. The estimation process is carried out with 4 previous peak load holiday to predict the peak load of the next holiday using data of the year 2005-2011 in Makassar City, Indonesia. The validation results show that the proposed method can offer very accurate forecasting results, indicated by small mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for the estimation task of the year of 2012 and 2013 in comparison to conventional least square polynomial approximation method.","doi":"10.1109/ICPERE.2016.7904869","pdfPath":"/iel7/7895373/7904837/07904869.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"239","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 3rd Conference on Power Engineering and Renewable Energy (ICPERE)","publicationTitle":"2016 3rd Conference on Power Engineering and Renewable Energy (ICPERE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPERE.2016.7904869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7904837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radial basis function (RBF) neural network for load forecasting during holiday","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7904869/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Nov. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Radial basis function (RBF) neural network for load forecasting during holiday","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","accessionNumber":"16824653","publicationDate":"2016","htmlLink":"/document/7904869/","conferenceDate":"29-30 Nov. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radial basis function (RBF) neural network for load forecasting during holiday","confLoc":"Yogyakarta, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"30A2-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047556S","chronDate":"29-30 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7895373","isNumber":"7904837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7895373","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7904837","articleId":"7904869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7904888,"authors":[{"name":"Kay-Uwe Giering","affiliation":["Fraunhofer IIS/EAS, Germany"],"firstName":"Kay-Uwe","lastName":"Giering","id":"37085382935"},{"name":"Andr\u00e9 Lange","affiliation":["Fraunhofer IIS/EAS, Germany"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e9","lastName":"Lange","id":"37083646100"},{"name":"Ben Kaczer","affiliation":["imec, Belgium"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Kaczer","id":"37268863500"},{"name":"Roland Jancke","affiliation":["Fraunhofer IIS/EAS, Germany"],"firstName":"Roland","lastName":"Jancke","id":"37601687200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4193-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-4192-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4194-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8036"}],"articleNumber":"7904888","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BTI variability of SRAM cells under periodically changing stress profiles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7904888","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stress","Microwave integrated circuits","Negative bias temperature instability","Thermal variables control","Degradation","Random access memory","Numerical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit modelling","integrated circuit reliability","negative bias temperature instability","numerical analysis","SRAM chips","stress analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BTI variability","SRAM cells","periodic change stress profiles","BTI compact model","complex electronic circuits","complex BTI stress patterns","circuit operation states","composite hierarchical structure","physics-based accurate NBTI modeling","numerical efficiency","multiple duty cycles","NBTI stress block temporal sequence","stress histograms"]}],"abstract":"We present a BTI compact model that is able to account for the complex BTI stress patterns encountered in complex electronic circuits. Such stress patterns are composed of various blocks corresponding to different circuit operation states, protocol modes or input conditions, and the blocks repeat within a composite, hierarchical structure. The present work extends a previously introduced physics-based accurate NBTI modeling while preserving its numerical efficiency. We provide insight into some principal characteristics of BTI degradation under hierarchical stress patterns, such as a non-trivial dependence on multiple duty cycles. In particular, the NBTI degradation can sensitively depend on the temporal sequence of NBTI stress blocks, and building a model on just the average stress or on stress histograms can be misleading. An SRAM cell example demonstrates this method and compares the cell's BTI failure statistics for two different hierarchic-periods stress patterns.","doi":"10.1109/IIRW.2016.7904888","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IIRW.2016.7904888","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Integrated Reliability Workshop (IIRW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Integrated Reliability Workshop (IIRW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7898592/7904886/07904888.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7904886","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7904888/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"BTI variability of SRAM cells under periodically changing stress profiles","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16836825","htmlLink":"/document/7904888/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BTI variability of SRAM cells under periodically changing stress profiles","confLoc":"South Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01-08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100269S","chronDate":"9-13 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7898592","isNumber":"7904886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7898592","xplore-issue":"7904886","articleId":"7904888","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7904906,"authors":[{"name":"Niaz Mahmud","affiliation":["College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CNSE), SUNY Polytechnic Institute, Albany, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Niaz","lastName":"Mahmud","id":"37086002261"},{"name":"Avyaya J.

Since the hybrid CT/DT cascade modulator has to be integrated in a standard Integrated Circuit (IC) technology, the analysis problem is formulated as a fast operation and power-efficient problem and is solved using a multirate modulator with discrete-time stages operating at the lowest sampling frequency when the input signal is downsampled. This fact enhances the operation of the continuous-time stage (i.e. front-end) to higher frequencies. The validity of the analytical models has checked by comparison with SIMSIDES software MATLAB/Simulink toolbox simulations. The match between results demonstrates that the modulator response operates according to the lower sampling frequency while the alias is properly eliminated by the Digital Cancellation Logic (DCL). In this proposal no extra analog circuits are required.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905018/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 March 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7905018/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"16836089","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of a multirate CT/DT cascade \u03a3\u0394 modulator \u2014 impact of using a lowest output sampling frequency","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of a multirate CT/DT cascade \u03a3\u0394 modulator \u2014 impact of using a lowest output sampling frequency","confLoc":"Bucharest, Romania","sourcePdf":"106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063198S","chronDate":"23-25 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7895507","isNumber":"7905014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7895507","xplore-issue":"7905014","articleId":"7905018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7905078,"authors":[{"name":"Mircea Ruba","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Machines and Drives, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Cluj, Romania"],"firstName":"Mircea","lastName":"Ruba","id":"37543260700"},{"name":"Sorina Ciornei","affiliation":["Universitatea Tehnica din Cluj-Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, RO"],"firstName":"Sorina","lastName":"Ciornei"},{"name":"Horia Hedesiu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Machines and Drives, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Cluj, Romania"],"firstName":"Horia","lastName":"Hedesiu","id":"37612467200"},{"name":"Claudia Martis","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Machines and Drives, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Cluj, Romania"],"firstName":"Claudia","lastName":"Martis","id":"37062656900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5160-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5159-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5161-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7905078","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":294},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complete FPGA based real-time motor drive simulator with bidirectional battery and ultracapacitor power supply","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7905078","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Batteries","Supercapacitors","Mathematical model","Torque","Analytical models","Load modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cells (electric)","DC-DC power convertors","electric vehicles","field programmable gate arrays","machine vector control","permanent magnet motors","supercapacitors","synchronous motor drives","traction motor drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motor drive simulator","bidirectional battery","ultracapacitor power supply","UC models","bidirectional buck-boost converter","permanent magnet synchronous machine","PMSM","traction motor","light electric vehicles","energy transfer equipment","energy source","auxiliary ultracapacitor","real-time model in the loop","RTMiL simulator","field programmable gate array","field oriented control","digital I-O","analog I-O","National Instruments","LAB VIEW FPGA","graphical programming environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","real time model in the loop","control","light electric vehicle","Bidirectional Buck-Boost converter"]}],"abstract":"The paper describes step by step the process of constructing and testing real-time tool for analysis of a bidirectional Buck-Boost converter supplying a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM), as a traction motor for light electric vehicles. This converter was developed to be used as a controlled energy transfer equipment between the main energy source of a battery and an auxiliary ultracapacitor. The focus of this paper is to create a real-time model in the loop (RTMiL) simulator based on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). By this, the gap between the simulated models and the behavior of the real machine and its converter is diminished. The machine and the control unit with Field Oriented Control will be modeled on two FPGAs while for the Buck-Boost Converter, the battery and the ultracapacitor (UC) models will use a third FPGA. The communication between these devices is performed via the digital and analog I/Os. Hardware tools from National Instruments are used and the FPGA's are programmed using LAB VIEW FPGA graphical programming environment.","doi":"10.1109/ATEE.2017.7905078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATEE.2017.7905078","publicationTitle":"2017 10th International Symposium on Advanced Topics in Electrical Engineering (ATEE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 10th International Symposium on Advanced Topics in Electrical Engineering (ATEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7895507/7905014/07905078.pdf","startPage":"186","endPage":"191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905014","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905078/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 March 2017","displayDocTitle":"Complete FPGA based real-time motor drive simulator with bidirectional battery and ultracapacitor power supply","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 March 2017","accessionNumber":"16824686","htmlLink":"/document/7905078/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complete FPGA based real-time motor drive simulator with bidirectional battery and ultracapacitor power supply","confLoc":"Bucharest, Romania","sourcePdf":"188.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093216S","chronDate":"23-25 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7895507","isNumber":"7905014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7895507","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7905014","articleId":"7905078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7905087,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Louzazni","affiliation":["Laboratoty of Innovative Technologies, Abdelmalek Essaadi University, Tangier, Morocco"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Louzazni","id":"37085718932"},{"name":"Ahmed Khouya","affiliation":["Laboratoty of Innovative Technologies, Abdelmalek Essaadi University, Tangier, Morocco"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Khouya","id":"37086033180"},{"name":"Khalid Amechnoue","affiliation":["Laboratoty of Innovative Technologies, Abdelmalek Essaadi University, Tangier, Morocco"],"firstName":"Khalid","lastName":"Amechnoue","id":"37086037843"},{"name":"Aurelian Cr\u0103ciunescu","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University \u201cPolitehnica\u201d of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Aurelian","lastName":"Cr\u0103ciunescu","id":"37603387800"},{"name":"Marco Mussetta","affiliation":["Laboratoty of Innovative Technologies, Abdelmalek Essaadi University, Tangier, Morocco"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Mussetta","id":"37282204400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5160-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5159-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5161-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7905087","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":329},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7905087","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Photovoltaic cells","Mathematical model","Optimization","Linear programming","Silicon","Particle swarm optimization","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elemental semiconductors","nonlinear equations","silicon","solar cells","stochastic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["double-diode parameters","single-diode parameters","current-voltage nonlinearity","implicit nonlinear equation","constraint functions","firefly algorithm optimization","nature-inspired stochastic optimization algorithm","global optimization","flashing pattern","firefly swarm behavior","solar cell modelling approach","equivalent circuit parameter","RTC France Company","monocrystalline silicon solar cell","statistical errors","current-voltage curve","temperature 33 degC","Si"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Solar cell","Double diodes","Firefly algorithm","Constraint functions","Intrinsic parameters"]}],"abstract":"Due to the non-linearity of current-voltage of solar cell model, the conventional methods are incapable to extract the parameters of solar cell with high accuracy.

The main component of the microfluidic transistors is the gate, that is, the structure where the actuation takes place. For nMOS microfluidic transistors, this part is a microstructure which includes two membranes, namely, a small membrane and large membrane, linked each other by a column. The natural frequencies of the gate have to be known in order to avoid undesired behaviors. In this paper, a numerical dynamic analysis using Finite Element Method is performed in order to obtain the natural frequencies of this kind of structures, and specially the effects of those results in the whole behavior of the nMOS microfluidic transistor. The study is performed using the parameters of a fabricated microfluidic transistor, where the microstructure of the gate was correctly designed using SU-8 as material. The results show the first natural frequencies at about 4.15 kHz. This value is proposed as maximum working frequency of that particular microfluidic transistor.","doi":"10.1109/CDE.2017.7905249","publicationTitle":"2017 Spanish Conference on Electron Devices (CDE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Spanish Conference on Electron Devices (CDE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897402/7905201/07905249.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDE.2017.7905249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic study of the gate of an n-MOS microfluidic transistor for computational microfluidics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7905249","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Feb. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905249/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic study of the gate of an n-MOS microfluidic transistor for computational microfluidics","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16824795","htmlLink":"/document/7905249/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic study of the gate of an n-MOS microfluidic transistor for computational microfluidics","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"R-0012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040119S","chronDate":"8-10 Feb. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7897402","isNumber":"7905201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897402","xplore-issue":"7905201","articleId":"7905249","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7905250,"authors":[{"name":"G.

This paper presents the fundamental technology behind the cloud computing. Cloud computing posit as a utopia to solve multitudes of challenges of the current time. But in practice security is a major road block to its widespread adoption. This paper discusses the security issues of the cloud computing. Further the paper illustrates upon the security solutions for the virtualization and web services, two major enabling technologies of cloud computing.

The cryptographic KECCAK algorithm is implemented in many cryptographic circuits to ensure security. It is become the standard algorithm used to ensure the information integrity in numerous applications. To secure the KECCAK algorithm against the physical attacks as the fault attacks, a few numbers of countermeasures have been proposed. These fault attacks consist to inject a faulty data into KECCAK design to obtain the confidential information. In this work, we proposed a fault detection scheme based scrambling technique to secure KECCAK algorithm. We explain the KECCAK scheme details in each operation. The simulation faults results demonstrate that the fault coverage percentage reaches 99.995% for KECCAK scheme. In addition, the proposed architecture has been implemented on the FPGA platform. The frequency and the throughput degradations and area overhead of the KECCAK detection scheme have been evaluated and it is shown that our scheme leads high performances from frequency and throughput viewpoint.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient countermeasure for reliable KECCAK architecture against fault attacks","doi":"10.1109/Anti-Cybercrime.2017.7905263","startPage":"55","endPage":"59","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Anti-Cybercrime.2017.7905263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905252","publicationTitle":"2017 2nd International Conference on Anti-Cyber Crimes (ICACC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 2nd International Conference on Anti-Cyber Crimes (ICACC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7899160/7905252/07905263.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7905263","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905263/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 March 2017","displayDocTitle":"Efficient countermeasure for reliable KECCAK architecture against fault attacks","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7905263/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16837159","conferenceDate":"26-27 March 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient countermeasure for reliable KECCAK architecture against fault attacks","confLoc":"Abha, Saudi Arabia","sourcePdf":"11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040514S","chronDate":"26-27 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7899160","isNumber":"7905252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7899160","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7905252","articleId":"7905263","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7905272,"authors":[{"name":"Waseem Ahmed","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, King AbdulAziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Waseem","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37075877500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5814-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5815-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7905272","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":300},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating High Performance Computing (HPC) requirements of devices on the Smart Grid for increased cybersecurity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7905272","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart grids","Cryptography","Computer security","Protocols","Energy management","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel processing","power engineering computing","power system security","security of data","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high performance computing","HPC requirements","smart grid","cybersecurity","parallel computing paradigms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Smart Grid","cybersecurity","HPC","security"]}],"abstract":"There has been a lot of research in developing technologies and strategies to make Smart Grid a practical reality. Research has focussed on a wide range of domains like communication technologies and protocols, infrastructure reliability and availability, designing of intelligent applications and distribution automation. However, to make Smart Grid to be widely accepted and adopted by the community, security at all levels of the smart grid will have to be ensured. Although, existing security approaches could be applied to control cybercrime on the smart grid, the limited latency tolerance of communications within certain levels of the smart grid make it challenging. With an aim to address this problem, the paper makes three important contributions. First, it introduces a classification of devices used in the smart grid based on their computational capabilities. Second, it highlights the challenges faced in addressing the high performance computational requirements of cybersecurity in the smart grid. Third, it proposes a few practical solutions from research in advanced processor and accelerators architectures and parallel computing paradigms commonly used in the field of High Performance Computing in addressing them. Overall, a strong case is presented to revisit the standards that specify the minimum processor requirements of devices connected to the smart grid at all levels to increase cybersecurity on the smart grid.","doi":"10.1109/Anti-Cybercrime.2017.7905272","startPage":"103","publicationTitle":"2017 2nd International Conference on Anti-Cyber Crimes (ICACC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 2nd International Conference on Anti-Cyber Crimes (ICACC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7899160/7905252/07905272.pdf","endPage":"107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Anti-Cybercrime.2017.7905272","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-27 March 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 March 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905272/","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating High Performance Computing (HPC) requirements of devices on the Smart Grid for increased cybersecurity","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7905272/","accessionNumber":"16837175","publicationDate":"March 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating High Performance Computing (HPC) requirements of devices on the Smart Grid for increased cybersecurity","confLoc":"Abha, Saudi Arabia","sourcePdf":"20.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056762S","chronDate":"26-27 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7899160","isNumber":"7905252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7899160","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7905252","articleId":"7905272","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7905277,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Cognitive Radio (CR) is the newest technology to make the secondary users to make use of licensed spectrum in the opportunistic manner. In the proposed structure, politics of switching channel and a proactive spectrum handoff protocol are let cognitive users use a channel before a primary user occupy it to avoid unwanted interference. Network coordination techniques for cognitive users are also included into the spectrum handoff protocol design to realize channel collision. In the reactive spectrum handoff type, secondary users transmit a packet without predicting the availability of the current channel at the moment when a frame ends. Here is compared the capacity of proposed proactive spectrum handoff scheme with the reactive spectrum handoff type. Proactive spectrum handoff always shows better performance than reactive spectrum handoff in terms of highest capacity and lower collision rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905323/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","accessionNumber":"16837003","htmlLink":"/document/7905323/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Proactive spectrum handoff performance evaluation model for Cognitive Radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proactive spectrum handoff performance evaluation model for Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Kharkiv, Ukraine","sourcePdf":"picst16_06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041542S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7898713","isNumber":"7905312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7898713","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7905312","articleId":"7905323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7905333,"authors":[{"name":"Yuriy Gorbenko","affiliation":["JSC \u201cInstitute of Information Technologies\u201d, Kharkiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Yuriy","lastName":"Gorbenko","id":"37086062316"},{"name":"Igor Svatovskiy","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems and Technologies Security, V.

Due to their flexibility and lower time to market, FPGAs are increasingly used for many applications. Arbiter PUFs (APUFs) are among the most widely studied PUF designs. However, they often suffer from poor uniqueness and reliability characteristics, are difficult to implement in FPGAs and consume excessive FPGA resources. To address these problems, a new Flip-flop based APUF (FF-APUF) design is proposed that offers a compact architecture, combined with strong uniqueness and good reliability. It is specifically designed for FPGAs. The proposed work is verified on a low-cost Nexys4 board based on the latest 28 nm technology Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA. The proposed FF-APUF circuit for generating a 1-bit response consumes only 44 slices, which is a saving of more than 66% in hardware resources over previous related research. Moreover, experimental results show improvements in both uniqueness and reliability. In particular, the expected uniqueness of the response bits is 40% on FPGA, which significantly improves upon a uniqueness of 9% achieved in previous work.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel lightweight FF-APUF design for FPGA","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2016.7905439","startPage":"75","endPage":"80","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2016.7905439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905397","publicationTitle":"2016 29th IEEE International System-on-Chip Conference (SOCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 29th IEEE International System-on-Chip Conference (SOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897353/7905397/07905439.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7905439","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905439/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Novel lightweight FF-APUF design for FPGA","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7905439/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16836308","conferenceDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel lightweight FF-APUF design for FPGA","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"042_p1-gu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077999S","chronDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897353","isNumber":"7905397","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897353","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7905397","articleId":"7905439","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7905440,"authors":[{"name":"Mihir Mody","affiliation":["Automotive Processor Business, Texas Instruments Inc Dallas, Bangalore"],"firstName":"Mihir","lastName":"Mody","id":"37946111500"},{"name":"Niraj Nandan","affiliation":["Automotive Processor Business, Texas Instruments Inc Dallas, Bangalore"],"firstName":"Niraj","lastName":"Nandan","id":"37085374013"},{"name":"Hetul Sanghvi","affiliation":["Automotive Processor Business, Texas Instruments Inc Dallas, Bangalore"],"firstName":"Hetul","lastName":"Sanghvi","id":"37085389155"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1367-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1366-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1368-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-1706"}],"articleNumber":"7905440","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":188},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient VLSI architecture for SAO decoding in 4K Ultra-HD HEVC video codec","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7905440","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Filtering","Engines","High efficiency video coding","Very large scale integration","Standards","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","video codecs","video coding","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI architecture","SAO decoding","4K ultraHD HEVC video codec engine","sample adaptive offset","video coding standard","data transfer scheme","block based processing","customized scanning order","generic region based transfer scheme","low power process node","size 28 nm","frequency 266 MHz","memory size 127 KByte"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SAO","HEVC","Ultra-HD","VLSI","Loop Filter","H.264","de-blocking"]}],"abstract":"Sample Adaptive Offset (SAO) is a new tool added in latest video coding standard (HEVC) to achieve better coding efficiency resulting in higher visual quality.

The design process including the physical design for an application specific SoC has become more complex due to large number of distinct functional modules. Existing physical design flow usually needs many iterations for successful design closure. In this paper, we propose a uniform wire distribution driven early global routing framework. The goal is to assist in obtaining an optimal routing solution for a given SoC floorplan such that the subsequent stages have fewer iterations. Based on the proposed congestion penalty, hierarchical routing order of the nets and a suitable routing region definition for a given floorplan, our method finds a solution with 100% routing completion, total wirelength within a constant bound of HPWL and no overflow in congestion for a given number of routing layers. We also estimate the number of vias incurred due to an existing minimal bend routing topology and uniform wire distribution for a set of routing layers. Experiments on IBM HB floorplanning benchmarks yield 45% improvement in average congestion with marginal increase in netlength, via count, and runtime for up to 8 layer HV routing.

This paper presents a novel and a power proficient design of a Dual Functionality Read-Write (DFR-W) driver for SRAM sub-system. This design is integrated with a memory sub-system with an operating frequency of 1GHz in CMOS 65nm technology. It is then compared with a conventional memory architecture on grounds of power, area, leakage and speed of operation for varied memory capacities. DFR-W depicts a reduction of up to 35.58% in latching delay and of about 14% in writing time as compared to the conventional memory architecture. For the new design, there is a drastic decline in leakage current when the device is in hold mode. In DFR-W driver, leakage reduces to about 8.0844nA as compared to 22.833nA in the conventional design. The complete memory architecture with DFR-W driver shows a reduction of up to 6% in the power dissipation as compared to the conventional design. The proposed design performance is found way superior and efficient in terms of speed and power.","publicationTitle":"2016 29th IEEE International System-on-Chip Conference (SOCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 29th IEEE International System-on-Chip Conference (SOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897353/7905397/07905487.pdf","startPage":"280","endPage":"285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel design of a Dual Functionality Read-Write driver for SRAM","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2016.7905487","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905397","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2016.7905487","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7905487","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905487/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A novel design of a Dual Functionality Read-Write driver for SRAM","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16836379","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7905487/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel design of a Dual Functionality Read-Write driver for SRAM","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"090_p2-sharma.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046482S","chronDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897353","isNumber":"7905397","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897353","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7905397","articleId":"7905487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7905499,"authors":[{"name":"Ao Ren","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University"],"firstName":"Ao","lastName":"Ren","id":"37085862156"},{"name":"Bo Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, City University of New York"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Yuan","id":"38521367500"},{"name":"Yanzhi Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University"],"firstName":"Yanzhi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37966617700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1367-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1366-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1368-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-1706"}],"articleNumber":"7905499","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":460},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7905499","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Libraries","FinFETs","Decoding","Standards","Hardware","Power demand","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","low-power electronics","MOSFET"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed low-power polar BP decoder","channel capacity","channel code","next-generation wireless communication systems","VLSI implementation","real-time energy-constraint mobile device","FinFET","near-threshold computing technology","NTC technology","belief propagation decoding approach","power consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["polar codes","belief propagation (BP)","FinFET","near-threshold computing"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905397","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 29th IEEE International System-on-Chip Conference (SOCC)","publicationTitle":"2016 29th IEEE International System-on-Chip Conference (SOCC)","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2016.7905499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of high-speed low-power polar BP decoder using emerging technologies","startPage":"312","endPage":"316","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897353/7905397/07905499.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2016.7905499","abstract":"With the provable asymptotically optimal property in the sense of channel capacity, polar codes have emerged as one of the potential channel code candidates for the next-generation wireless communication systems. To date, numerous works have been reported on VLSI implementation of polar decoders. However, the efficient hardware design of polar decoders that can be used in the real-time energy-constraint mobile devices is still a huge challenge. This paper, for the first time, investigates high-speed low-power polar decoder design using FinFET and near-threshold computing (NTC) technologies. Specifically, the hardware performance of polar decoder with belief propagation (BP) decoding approach is studied and evaluated. Synthesis results show that the joint use of these two emerging technologies can lead to significant reduction in both power consumption and decoding delay at the same time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905499/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","conferenceDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7905499/","accessionNumber":"16836353","displayDocTitle":"Design of high-speed low-power polar BP decoder using emerging technologies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of high-speed low-power polar BP decoder using emerging technologies","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"102_p1-ren.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057137S","chronDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897353","isNumber":"7905397","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897353","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7905397","articleId":"7905499","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7905500,"authors":[{"name":"Ruizhe Cai","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Ruizhe","lastName":"Cai","id":"37085851799"},{"name":"Ao Ren","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Ao","lastName":"Ren","id":"37085862156"},{"name":"Yanzhi Wang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yanzhi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085678297"},{"name":"Sucheta Soundarajan","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Sucheta","lastName":"Soundarajan","id":"37086098964"},{"name":"Qinru Qiu","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Qinru","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37267088600"},{"name":"Bo Yuan","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, City University of New York, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Yuan","id":"38521367500"},{"name":"Paul Bogdan","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Bogdan","id":"37299894300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1367-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1366-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1368-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-1706"}],"articleNumber":"7905500","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":248},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-computation-complexity, energy-efficient, and high-performance linear program solver using memristor crossbars","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 29th IEEE International System-on-Chip Conference (SOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897353/7905397/07905500.pdf","startPage":"317","endPage":"322","publicationTitle":"2016 29th IEEE International System-on-Chip Conference (SOCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2016.7905500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905397","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2016.7905500","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memristors","Mathematical model","Linear systems","Algorithm design and analysis","Handheld computers","Complexity theory","Scalability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue circuits","circuit optimisation","computational complexity","energy conservation","linear programming","matrix decomposition","matrix multiplication","memristor circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-computation-complexity","high-performance linear program solver","energy-efficiency","optimization problems","primal-dual interior point method","PDIP method","matrix-vector multiplication decomposition","linear equations","O(1) time complexity","memristor crossbar technique","analog domain","nonnegative coefficients"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7905500","abstract":"Linear programming is required in a wide variety of application including routing, scheduling, and various optimization problems.

This work is the first to apply memristor crossbar for linear program solving based on the PDIP method, which has been reformulated for memristor crossbars to compute in the analog domain. The proposed linear program solver can overcome limitations of memristor crossbars such as supporting only non-negative coefficients, and has been extended for higher scalability.

Targeting to different types of training and inference tasks, the structure of DNN varies with flexible choices of different component layers, such as fully connection layer, convolutional layer, pooling layer and softmax layer. Deviated from other layers that only require simple operations like addition or multiplication, the softmax layer contains expensive exponentiation and division, thereby causing the hardware design of softmax layer suffering from high complexity, long critical path delay and overflow problems. This paper, for the first time, presents efficient hardware architecture of softmax layer in DNN. By utilizing the domain transformation technique and down-scaling approach, the proposed hardware architecture avoids the aforementioned problems. Analysis shows that the proposed hardware architecture achieves reduced hardware complexity and critical path delay.","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2016.7905501","publicationTitle":"2016 29th IEEE International System-on-Chip Conference (SOCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 29th IEEE International System-on-Chip Conference (SOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897353/7905397/07905501.pdf","startPage":"323","endPage":"326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2016.7905501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905397","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient hardware architecture of softmax layer in deep neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905501/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Efficient hardware architecture of softmax layer in deep neural network","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7905501/","accessionNumber":"16836371","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient hardware architecture of softmax layer in deep neural network","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"104_p3-yuan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04442S","chronDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897353","isNumber":"7905397","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897353","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7905397","articleId":"7905501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7905519,"authors":[{"name":"Taoufiq Ait Benrami","affiliation":["Faculty of Sciences UIZ Agadir, Morocco"],"firstName":"Taoufiq Ait","lastName":"Benrami","id":"37086137881"},{"name":"Younes Jabrane","affiliation":["OSCARS Lab ENSAM UCA Marrakech, Morocco"],"firstName":"Younes","lastName":"Jabrane","id":"37541835600"},{"name":"Jilali Antari","affiliation":["Faculty of Sciences UIZ Agadir, Morocco"],"firstName":"Jilali","lastName":"Antari","id":"37403908900"},{"name":"Radouane Iqdour","affiliation":["CRMEF Marrakech, Morocco"],"firstName":"Radouane","lastName":"Iqdour","id":"38056450600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5146-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-5145-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5147-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7652"}],"articleNumber":"7905519","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Receivers","OFDM","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Long Term Evolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","code division multiple access","phase shift keying","radiofrequency interference","spread spectrum communication","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet networks","MAI cancellation","WDS MC-DS-CDMA system","weighted despreading sequences","multiple access interference annulation","BPSK modulation","AWGN channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wavelet Networks","MC-CDMA","WDS","MAI"]}],"abstract":"The Weighted Despreading Sequences are deployed for an optimal use in Multiple Access Interference annulation caused by users multiple access to the channel.

To test our algorithm we used a set of Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) instances.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905544/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2016-Oct. 1 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-1 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7905544/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16836161","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel based Hidden Markov Model approach for controlling the ACS-TSP evaporation parameter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel based Hidden Markov Model approach for controlling the ACS-TSP evaporation parameter","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morocco","sourcePdf":"ICMCS16_paper_148.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049103S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2016-Oct. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7896955","isNumber":"7905513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7896955","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7905513","articleId":"7905544","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7905613,"authors":[{"name":"Amal Benfateh","affiliation":["Universite Cadi Ayyad, Marrakech, MA"],"firstName":"Amal","lastName":"Benfateh"},{"name":"F.

Polar coding is based on the so-called channel polarization phenomenon induced by a transform over the underlying binary-input channel. The channel polarization is found to be universal in many signal processing problems and is applied to the coded modulation schemes. In this paper, a small length polar, encoded for a MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) systems with soft output MMSE-SIC (Minimum Mean Square Error-Successive Cancellation) detection, is applied to improve the coded performance while reducing the complexity. In order to prove this theory, we compare the proposed MMSE-SIC BER to Zero Forcing (ZF) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) by using 2*2 MIMO systems into Rayleigh channel with BPSK (Binary Phase-Shift Keying) modulation. Simulation results show that MMSE-SIC complexity is lower than the two others detections.

Many people sometimes ignore, even worse underestimate this, but if it's been ignored too long, it will lead to death. Thus it's necessary for routine check to determine whether there is disturbance in the stomach organ or not. One simple way to check is through the iris or called iridology. Iridology in science is based on an analysis of the composition of the iris. In particular slice has specific advantages, which can record all state organs, body construction, also psychological condition. In this final project will be made a system which can detect the presence or absence of disturbances in someone's stomach. This software works by taking an image by camera. After that, system will do the feature extraction by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and classify it with method Backpropagation Neural Network. From result of testing that has been done, the conclusion is the system is very good at doing classification process with one hidden layer and produce a level of accuracy up to 87,5% from 40 iris image data.","doi":"10.1109/IAC.2016.7905714","pdfPath":"/iel7/7894592/7905673/07905714.pdf","startPage":"192","endPage":"197","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Informatics and Computing (ICIC)","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Informatics and Computing (ICIC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAC.2016.7905714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stomach disorder detection through the Iris Image using Backpropagation Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905714/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Stomach disorder detection through the Iris Image using Backpropagation Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","accessionNumber":"16836030","publicationDate":"2016","htmlLink":"/document/7905714/","conferenceDate":"28-29 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stomach disorder detection through the Iris Image using Backpropagation Neural Network","confLoc":"Mataram, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"p192-dewi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097296S","chronDate":"28-29 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7894592","isNumber":"7905673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7894592","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7905673","articleId":"7905714","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7905751,"authors":[{"name":"Gigih Forda Nama","affiliation":["Department of Informatics Engineering, University of Lampung, Lampung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Gigih Forda","lastName":"Nama","id":"37085666946"},{"name":"Dikpride Despa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Lampung, Lampung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Dikpride","lastName":"Despa","id":"37990747700"},{"name":"Mardiana","affiliation":["Department of Informatics Engineering, University of Lampung, Lampung, Indonesia"],"lastName":"Mardiana","id":"38466652500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1648-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1649-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7905751","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":252},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Voltage measurement","Current measurement","Computers","Reactive power","Energy consumption","Buildings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","embedded systems","Internet","microcomputers","power aware computing","power factor","power supply quality","power transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical quantities","ICT centre building University of Lampung","Unila","academic institution","Internet service","maintenance lifecycle","electricity supply quality","statistic reports","Web interface","3-phase electricity network","step-down transformator","voltage sensor","current transformer SCT-013 100A","power factor","Python programming language","BCM2835 embedded single board computer","energy consumption","data center","network equipment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3-Phase electrical networks","embedded system","voltage sensors","current transformer SCT-013 100A","energy consumption","BCM2835 embedded single board computer"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7905751","abstract":"University of Lampung (Unila) as an academic institution should provide the internet service for thousands of users, monitoring the condition of electricity (Voltage, Current, Power factor, Power, and Energy consumption measurement) at ICT center building has an important role, as a part of maintenance lifecycle to make sure the internet services running well, system monitoring implemented in order to know the quality of electricity supply in the system, identifying disruption events, and to calculate the amount of electrical energy usage periodically.

In this work, we consider the resource allocation problem of a visible light communication downlink transmission system based on time division multiple access with the objective of maximizing spectral efficiency (SE). As for the operational conditions, we impose constraints on the average optical intensity, the energy consumption and the quality-of-service. To solve the non-convex problem, we transform the objective function into a difference of concave functions by solving a second order differential inequality. Then, we propose a low-complexity algorithm to solve the resource allocation problem. Finally, we show by simulations the SE performance gains achieved by optimizing the power allocation over equal power allocation in the considered system. Numerical results show the SE gains achieved by using this solution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905771/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7905771/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","accessionNumber":"16836814","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Downlink resource allocation for multichannel TDMA visible light communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink resource allocation for multichannel TDMA visible light communications","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0000001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051421S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897403","isNumber":"7905762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897403","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7905762","articleId":"7905771","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7905795,"authors":[{"name":"Deep Shrestha","affiliation":["Centre Tecnologic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), Castelldefels, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Deep","lastName":"Shrestha","id":"37543021800"},{"name":"Xavier Mestre","affiliation":["Centre Tecnologic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), Castelldefels, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Xavier","lastName":"Mestre","id":"37284392300"},{"name":"Miquel Payar\u00f3","affiliation":["Centre Tecnologic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), Castelldefels, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Miquel","lastName":"Payar\u00f3","id":"37294676000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4545-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4544-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4546-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7905795","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":265},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Receivers","Maximum likelihood estimation","Frequency response","Frequency-domain analysis","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","channel estimation","frequency response","impulse noise","maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power line communication","deterministic response","channel frequency response","OFDM based PLC system","information detection","power spectral density","impulsive noise","maximum-likelihood channel estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Impulsive noise","Maximum-likelihood channel estimation","OFDM","PLC"]}],"abstract":"Impulsive noise in power lines usually bears higher power spectral density than the background noise. Even a sample of such noise, if not mitigated, destroys symbols in all the subcarriers affecting channel estimation and information detection. In this paper, we study two maximum-likelihood approaches to estimate the channel in the presence of impulsive noise for an OFDM based PLC system. In both approaches, we approximate the impulsive noise first and use it to determine the channel frequency response. In the first approach, we assume the estimated noise to be random and perform the channel estimation assuming that its statistics are given. In the second approach, the impulsive noise is assumed to be deterministic and the channel frequency response is determined after proper subtraction from the observations. As will be shown by simulation results, the estimator that assumes noise to be random generally performs better than the one that treats the estimated impulsive noise as a deterministic quantity.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905795","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905762","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897403/7905762/07905795.pdf","endPage":"24","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum-likelihood channel estimation in presence of impulsive noise for PLC systems","doi":"10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905795","startPage":"20","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7905795","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Maximum-likelihood channel estimation in presence of impulsive noise for PLC systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905795/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","accessionNumber":"16836620","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7905795/","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum-likelihood channel estimation in presence of impulsive noise for PLC systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0000020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070584S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897403","isNumber":"7905762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897403","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7905762","articleId":"7905795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7905804,"authors":[{"name":"Mingjian Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Hunan Police Academy, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Mingjian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085998117"},{"name":"Xiaohua Li","affiliation":["Department of ECE, State University of New York at Binghamton, Binghamton, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaohua","lastName":"Li","id":"37280865500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4545-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4544-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4546-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7905804","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Signal processing algorithms","Feature extraction","Covariance matrices","Optimization","Blind source separation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","optimisation","search problems","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error-accumulation mitigation","speech source signal separation","updating rule","constrained optimization","source signal estimation","source signal extraction","BSE algorithm","exact solution subspace searching scheme","deflationary blind source extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind source extraction","deflation","exact solution subspace searching","error accumulation","source separation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we develop a new deflation-based blind source extraction (BSE) algorithm to estimate and extract source signals in a sequential fashion from the mixtures.

The challenge associated with the beamforming problem is twofold. Firstly, the process requires the inversion of the usually ill-conditioned covariance matrix of the received signals. Secondly, the steering vector pertaining to the direction of arrival of the signal of interest is not known precisely. To tackle these two challenges, the standard capon beamformer is manipulated to a form where the beamformer output is obtained as a scaled version of the inner product of two vectors. The two vectors are linearly related to the steering vector and the received signal snapshot, respectively. The linear operator, in both cases, is the square root of the covariance matrix. A regularized least-squares (RLS) approach is proposed to estimate these two vectors and to provide robustness without exploiting prior information. Simulation results show that the RLS beamformer using the proposed regularization algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art beamforming algorithms, as well as another RLS beamformers using a standard regularization approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905806/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","accessionNumber":"16836658","htmlLink":"/document/7905806/","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Robust regularized least-squares beamforming approach to signal estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust regularized least-squares beamforming approach to signal estimation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0000075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0491S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897403","isNumber":"7905762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897403","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7905762","articleId":"7905806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7905817,"authors":[{"name":"Shahab Farazi","affiliation":["Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA"],"firstName":"Shahab","lastName":"Farazi","id":"37085793190"},{"name":"Kim Chinkidjakarn","affiliation":["Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA"],"firstName":"Kim","lastName":"Chinkidjakarn","id":"37086021476"},{"name":"D.

We propose a new low-complexity but effective algorithm called Superresolution with Coupled Backpropagation (SR-CBP) which builds two Coupled Auto-encoder Networks (CAN), resp. the high-resolution (HR) and low-resolution (LR) networks, that capture the features of both high and low resolution images. The two networks in CAN have the ability to self-reconstruct its own input. Specifically, SR-CBP allows joint training of the LR and HR networks to have middle layer representations that agree for a pair of images (high-resolution image and its corresponding low-resolution version). For an LR input image, its middle layer representation obtained via the trained LR network can be fed into the HR network to generate the SR result. Preliminary experiments show that SR-CBP can produce better results than state of the art single image superresolution methods based on sparse representations. The memory and storage requirements of CAN are lesser than existing deep learning based SR methods.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905839","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897403/7905762/07905839.pdf","startPage":"237","endPage":"241","doi":"10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep learning based image super-resolution with coupled backpropagation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Deep learning based image super-resolution with coupled backpropagation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7905839/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16836624","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905839/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep learning based image super-resolution with coupled backpropagation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0000237.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084957S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897403","isNumber":"7905762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897403","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7905762","articleId":"7905839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7905840,"authors":[{"name":"Yingxue Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, US","School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yingxue","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085699727"},{"name":"Shenghui Zhao","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shenghui","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37293672400"},{"name":"Jianxin Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, US","School of Computer Science & Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianxin","lastName":"Li","id":"37405686200"},{"name":"Jingming Kuang","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jingming","lastName":"Kuang","id":"37266716500"},{"name":"Qiang Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, US"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086343409"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4545-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4544-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4546-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7905840","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Artificial neural networks","Bandwidth","Data models","Recurrent neural networks","Hidden Markov models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boltzmann machines","correlation methods","feedforward neural nets","recurrent neural nets","spectral analysis","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep nonlinear relationships modeling","adjacent frames","temporal correlation","feedforward NN","feedforward neural network","RTRBM","recurrent temporal restricted Boltzmann machines","spectral envelope features","spectral mapping","RNN based speech BWE method","recurrent neural network based speech bandwidth extension method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speech bandwidth extension","recurrent neural network","recurrent temporal restricted Boltzmann machine","Gaussian mixture model","feedforward neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7905840","abstract":"We present a recurrent neural network (RNN) based speech bandwidth extension (BWE) method. The conventional Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based BWE methods perform stably and effectively. However, GMM based methods suffer from two fundamental and competing problems: 1) inadequacy of GMM in modeling the non-linear relationship between the low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF), 2) temporal correlations across speech frames are ignored, resulting in spectral detail loss of the reconstructed speech by BWE. To cope these problems, a RNN is employed to capture temporal information and construct deep non-linear relationships between the spectral envelope features of LF and HF. The proposed RNN is trained layer-by-layer from a cascade of two recurrent temporal restricted Boltzmann machines (RTRBMs) and a feedforward neural network (NN). The proposed method takes advantage of the strong ability of RTRBMs in discovering the temporal correlation between adjacent frames and modeling deep non-linear relationships between input and output. Both the objective and subjective evaluations indicate that our proposed method outperforms the conventional GMM based methods and other NN based methods.","doi":"10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905840","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897403/7905762/07905840.pdf","startPage":"242","endPage":"246","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905762","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recurrent neural network for spectral mapping in speech bandwidth extension","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905840/","xploreNote":"This article was originally incorrectly tagged as not presented at the conference.

The approach is an optimized Discrete Wavelet Transform where at each level of the decomposition the best wavelet basis is selected as well as the optimum depth by means of information theory tools.

One prerequisite in such classification is to properly choose training documents. Active learning emerges as a technique to achieve better accuracy with fewer training documents by choosing data to learn and querying oracles for unknown labels. In practice, such oracles are usually human analysts who are likely to make mistakes or, in some cases, even intentionally introduce erroneous labels for malicious purposes. We propose a risk-factor based strategy to defend active-learning-based document classification against human mistakes or adversarial inputs.

sound source separation using deep neural networks","abstract":"Sound source separation at low-latency requires that each incoming frame of audio data be processed at very low delay, and outputted as soon as possible. For practical purposes involving human listeners, a 20 ms algorithmic delay is the uppermost limit which is comfortable to the listener. In this paper, we propose a low-latency (algorithmic delay <; 20 ms) deep neural network (DNN) based source separation method. The proposed method takes advantage of an extended past context, outputting soft time-frequency masking filters which are then applied to incoming audio frames to give better separation performance as compared to NMF baseline. Acoustic mixtures from five pairs of speakers from CMU Arctic database [1] were used for the experiments. At least 1 dB average improvement in source to distortion ratios (SDR) was observed in our DNN-based system over a low-latency NMF baseline for different processing and analysis frame lengths. The effect of incorporating previous temporal context into DNN inputs yielded significant improvements in SDR for short processing frame lengths.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905846/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16836759","htmlLink":"/document/7905846/","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Low-latency sound source separation using deep neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-latency sound source separation using deep neural networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0000272.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096405S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897403","isNumber":"7905762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897403","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7905762","articleId":"7905846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7905847,"authors":[{"name":"Timothy J.

However, a number of meaningful problems cannot be satisfactory addressed within the linear domain. Motivated by this, in this paper we introduce the concept of nonlinear weighted median graph filters (WMGF). The goal is to generalize the definition of classical weighted median filters to operate over graph signals not defined in regular domains such as time or a rectangular lattice. Under the proposed definition the output of a WMGF can be viewed as a nonlinear (median) combination of shifted versions of the input. Additionally, the value of each of these shifted versions at a particular node is found iteratively by computing the weighted median of the values of the previous shifted input within the one-hop neighborhood of the node. Within the class of WMGFs we pay special attention to center-WMGF - where each node can select its own weight but must weight all its neighbors evenly -, and analyze some of their properties, including the characterization of their roots. Simulations illustrating how our definitions can be used to model and analyze nonlinear network diffusion processes close the paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905859/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7905859/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16836615","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Center-weighted median graph filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Center-weighted median graph filters","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0000336.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054873S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897403","isNumber":"7905762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897403","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7905762","articleId":"7905859","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7905861,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Loukas","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunication Systems, TU, Berlin"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Loukas","id":"37882126800"},{"name":"Damien Foucard","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunication Systems, TU, Berlin"],"firstName":"Damien","lastName":"Foucard","id":"37086121136"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4545-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4544-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4546-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7905861","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":678},"abstract":"This paper focuses on the harmonic analysis of graph signals that evolve with time.

However, these parsimonious signals are oftentimes encountered with high-dimensional linear inverse problems. Hence, interest shifts from reconstructing the signal itself towards instead approximating the input to a prescribed linear operator efficiently. In this context, we propose a novel sampling scheme that leverages the bandlimitedness of the output as well as the transformation whose input we wish to approximate. We formulate problems to jointly optimize sample selection and a sketch of the target inverse mapping, so when the latter is affordably applied to the sampled output signal, the result is close to the desired input. The developed sampling plus reduced-complexity processing pipeline is particularly useful for streaming data, where the linear transform has to be applied fast and repeatedly to successive response signals.","doi":"10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905870","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905870","startPage":"390","endPage":"394","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897403/7905762/07905870.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905762","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rethinking sketching as sampling: Efficient approximate solution to linear inverse problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Rethinking sketching as sampling: Efficient approximate solution to linear inverse problems","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7905870/","accessionNumber":"16836677","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905870/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rethinking sketching as sampling: Efficient approximate solution to linear inverse problems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0000390.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058888S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897403","isNumber":"7905762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897403","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7905762","articleId":"7905870","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":7905883,"authors":[{"name":"Shailendra Singh","affiliation":["Qualcomm Atheros Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Shailendra","lastName":"Singh","id":"37086097223"},{"name":"Surendra Prasad","affiliation":["Dept.

However selecting fewer number of users for pre-coding and signal transmission may require less severe transmit power normalisation, leading to improvement in the downstream data rates. We develop an algorithm here to select the most suitable users for precoding such that the sum rate contribution of each tone of the DMT signal transmission is maximised. We also provide a method to update the pre-coder as the number of users for transmission are reduced and obtain transmit power normalisation corresponding to the updated pre-coder. Although the results proposed here are general and applicable to a variety of applications, we present the results in the context of downstream transmission on strongly coupled digital subscriber lines (DSL). The simulation results show a significant increase in the downstream data rates when the proposed algorithm is used to select appropriate users on different tones for zero-forcing (ZF) linear precoding of strongly coupled DSL users.","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897403/7905762/07905883.pdf","startPage":"455","endPage":"459","doi":"10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905883","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905762","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved zero-forcing linear precoder through tone suppression","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905883/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Improved zero-forcing linear precoder through tone suppression","htmlLink":"/document/7905883/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","accessionNumber":"16836609","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved zero-forcing linear precoder through tone suppression","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0000455.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083024S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897403","isNumber":"7905762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897403","xplore-issue":"7905762","articleId":"7905883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7905884,"authors":[{"name":"Sandeep Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India"],"firstName":"Sandeep","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085655564"},{"name":"Ketan Rajawat","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, IN"],"firstName":"Ketan","lastName":"Rajawat"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4545-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4544-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4546-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7905884","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":256},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Array signal processing","Optimization","Minimization","Matrix decomposition","Cellular networks","Distributed algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cellular radio","concave programming","distributed algorithms","interference suppression","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonconvex problem","proximal update step","distributed alternating directions method of multipliers algorithm","general-form consensus problem","rank-minimization form","low-complexity distributed algorithms","coordinated IA","centralized algorithms","multicell interference alignment","beamforming matrices","consensus ADMM","MIMO cellular network","distributed interference alignment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multi-cell coordinated beamforming","distributed optimization","interference alignment","non-convex","ADMM"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers the design of beamforming matrices for multi-cell interference alignment (IA).

Due to the uncertainty of channel fading and computation complexity of input/background tasks, both of communication and computation could cause the outage event of computation offloading, i.e., the computing and transmitting time exceeds a threshold. We propose a theoretical framework to analyze the outage bottleneck of single link computation offloading in a mobile cloud computation platform. Through theoretical analysis of the outage probability of computation offloading scheme, the outage bottleneck can be obtained. Numerical results will verify the theoretical derivation as well as illustrate that the outage bottleneck depends on the distributions of both background task and input task.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage bottleneck for reliable mobile computation offloading: Transmission or computation?","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","doi":"10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905885","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897403/7905762/07905885.pdf","startPage":"465","endPage":"469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905762","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7905885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905885/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Outage bottleneck for reliable mobile computation offloading: Transmission or computation?","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7905885/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16836633","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage bottleneck for reliable mobile computation offloading: Transmission or computation?","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0000465.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101619S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897403","isNumber":"7905762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897403","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7905762","articleId":"7905885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7905894,"authors":[{"name":"Tianyi Chen","affiliation":["Departments of ECE and DTC, University of Minnesota"],"firstName":"Tianyi","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085549578"},{"name":"Aryan Mokhtari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania"],"firstName":"Aryan","lastName":"Mokhtari","id":"37075294100"},{"name":"Xin Wang","affiliation":["Department of CSE and Key Lab for Inf.

To tackle the resultant static programming, we study its dual problem which contains finite number of variables in oppose to the primal problem that has infinite dimension. A novel online framework is developed by formulating the dual stochastic optimization as empirical risk minimization. We first propose an offline scheme for batch training which linearly converges to the optimal dual argument in expectation. The offline approach is further extended to the online setting which successfully converges to the statistical accuracy of the adaptive training set with high probability.

Simulations show a potential for improvements in terms of network utility and energy consumption.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897403/7905762/07905902.pdf","startPage":"550","endPage":"554","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","doi":"10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905902","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905762","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7905902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A distributed solution for proportional fairness optimization in load coupled OFDMA networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Resource management","Interference","Load modeling","Throughput","Nickel","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","energy consumption","frequency division multiple access","nonlinear programming","OFDM modulation","optimisation","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy consumption","base stations","message passing protocol","distributed optimality-achieving implementation","energy efficiency","convex network utility optimization problem","OFDMA-based wireless systems","nonlinear interference model","joint optimization","resource assignment","rate allocation","power allocation","orthogonal frequency multiple-access networks","distributed downlink technique","load-coupled OFDMA networks","proportional fairness optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["load-coupled networks","distributed fairness optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905902/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A distributed solution for proportional fairness optimization in load coupled OFDMA networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7905902/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16836539","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A distributed solution for proportional fairness optimization in load coupled OFDMA networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0000550.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060034S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897403","isNumber":"7905762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897403","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7905762","articleId":"7905902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7905910,"authors":[{"name":"Kaipeng Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX"],"firstName":"Kaipeng","lastName":"Li","id":"37085341578"},{"name":"Riski Skaran","affiliation":["Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, US"],"firstName":"Riski","lastName":"Skaran"},{"name":"Yujun Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX"],"firstName":"Yujun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086069724"},{"name":"Joseph R.

In this paper, we present a novel decentralized beamforming approach that partitions the base-station (BS) antenna array into separate clusters, each associated with independent computing hardware. We develop a decentralized beamforming algorithm that requires only local channel state information and minimum exchange of consensus information among the clusters. We demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of decentralized ZF beamforming for systems with hundreds of BS antennas using a reference implementation on a GPU cluster.","doi":"10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905910","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897403/7905762/07905910.pdf","startPage":"590","endPage":"594","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905910","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905762","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized beamforming for massive MU-MIMO on a GPU cluster","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7905910","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905910/","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized beamforming for massive MU-MIMO on a GPU cluster","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16836795","htmlLink":"/document/7905910/","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized beamforming for massive MU-MIMO on a GPU cluster","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0000590.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062372S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897403","isNumber":"7905762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897403","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7905762","articleId":"7905910","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7905912,"authors":[{"name":"Sungwoo Park","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Sungwoo","lastName":"Park","id":"37085785384"},{"name":"Ahmed Alkhateeb","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Alkhateeb","id":"37085375383"},{"name":"Robert W.

However, to overcome the high pathloss in the mmWave frequencies, beamforming with large antenna arrays is required at both the base station and user equipments for sufficient link budget. This feature is a challenge for beamforming training during initial access due to low SNR and poor synchronization. A recently developed compressive sensing (CS) based training algorithm exploits channel sparsity but it is vulnerable to phase error from poor synchronization. We propose a novel CS-based algorithm that tracks and compensates frequency offset and phase noise. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves achievable rate by 10 times compared with existing CS-based method during initial beamforming training.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing based initial beamforming training for massive MIMO millimeter-wave systems","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","doi":"10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905916","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897403/7905762/07905916.pdf","startPage":"620","endPage":"624","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905762","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7905916","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing based initial beamforming training for massive MIMO millimeter-wave systems","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7905916/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16836748","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing based initial beamforming training for massive MIMO millimeter-wave systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0000620.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048541S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897403","isNumber":"7905762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897403","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7905762","articleId":"7905916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7905919,"authors":[{"name":"Markku Renfors","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Communications Engineering, University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Markku","lastName":"Renfors","id":"37279773600"},{"name":"Juha Yli-Kaakinen","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Communications Engineering, University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Juha","lastName":"Yli-Kaakinen","id":"38271491500"},{"name":"Toni Levanen","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Communications Engineering, University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Toni","lastName":"Levanen","id":"37569021000"},{"name":"Mikko Valkama","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Communications Engineering, University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Mikko","lastName":"Valkama","id":"37267657500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4545-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4544-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4546-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7905919","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":326},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Bandwidth","Transforms","Shape","Uplink","5G mobile communication","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","convolution","discrete Fourier transforms","filtering theory","interference suppression","inverse transforms","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast-convolution filtered OFDM waveforms","adjustable CP length","FC filtering scheme","multiplexing OFDM physical resource blocks","PRBs","interference leakage suppression","independent waveform parametrization","asynchronous multiuser operation","5G waveform development","inverse discrete Fourier transform length","DFT-IDFT lengths","cyclic prefix OFDM system dimensioning","symbol duration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["waveforms","multicarrier","CP","filtered-OFDM","fast-convolution","5G"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the application of flexible and effective fast-convolution (FC) filtering scheme for multiplexing OFDM physical resource blocks (PRBs) in a spectrally well-localized manner.

The beamformer design becomes a nonconvex combinatorial problem with the user selection, which is also modeled as a part of our problem. In order to avoid the combinatorial search, we relax the binary association variable by a linear one and the nonconvex sets by a sequence of convex subsets by the successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Thereby, we design the beamformers by iteratively solving a convex subproblem in each SCA iteration. Additionally, to enforce sparsity in the relaxed binary variable, we regularize the objective with the associated entropy measure to enforce a binary solution. Since the beamformers are notified via backhaul to the respective BSs, we include the beamformer overhead also in the backhaul usage in addition to data sharing.

Thus, it is critical to explore all possible avenues to enable more orthogonal resources for the users to transmit non-interfering UL pilots. In conventional designs, pilot orthogonality typically assumes constant channel gains. To circumvent this constraint, in this paper, we show how to enable orthogonal multiplexing of pilots in the case of Doppler fading by aligning the power spectrum densities (PSD) of different users. From the derived PSD aligning rules, we can see multiple users can be sounded simultaneously without creating pilot contamination even when these users are experiencing time-varying channels. Furthermore, we provide analytical formulas characterizing the channel estimation mean square error (MSE) performance assuming ideal pilot orthogonality, which serve as the performance bounds for our proposed pilot designs. Computer simulations further confirm us the PSD alignment can serve as one important decontamination mechanism for the UL pilots in massive MIMO.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905921","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897403/7905762/07905921.pdf","startPage":"645","endPage":"649","doi":"10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot decontamination via Doppler PSD alignment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Pilot decontamination via Doppler PSD alignment","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7905921/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16836791","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905921/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot decontamination via Doppler PSD alignment","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0000645.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.176578S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897403","isNumber":"7905762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897403","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7905762","articleId":"7905921","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7905924,"authors":[{"name":"Ville Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Communications Eng., University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Ville","lastName":"Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4","id":"37304103300"},{"name":"Toni Levanen","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Communications Eng., University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Toni","lastName":"Levanen","id":"37569021000"},{"name":"Mikko Valkama","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Communications Eng., University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Mikko","lastName":"Valkama","id":"37267657500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4545-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4544-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4546-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7905924","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":324},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Discrete Fourier transforms","Signal to noise ratio","Conferences","Indexes","Additive noise","Manganese"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","error compensation","frequency-domain analysis","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","phase noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DFT-S-OFDM waveforms","communication links","phase error compensation","pilot configurations","logical symbols","DFT spreading","frequency domain pilot insertion","intercarrier interference compensation algorithm","peak-to-average power ratio","phase noise mitigation performance","numerical simulations","Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DFT-S-OFDM","5G","cm-wave","phase noise","enhancing digital signal processing"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of phase noise mitigation in communications links utilizing DFT-S-OFDM waveforms.

Simulation results have confirmed that the proposed scheme offers an improved spectral efficiency performance when considering the training overhead in FDD systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-density spatial RS design and channel estimation for FDD massive full-dimensional MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","doi":"10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905926","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897403/7905762/07905926.pdf","startPage":"670","endPage":"674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905762","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7905926","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905926/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Low-density spatial RS design and channel estimation for FDD massive full-dimensional MIMO systems","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7905926/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16836749","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-density spatial RS design and channel estimation for FDD massive full-dimensional MIMO systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0000670.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053652S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897403","isNumber":"7905762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897403","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7905762","articleId":"7905926","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7905927,"authors":[{"name":"David Borges","affiliation":["DEE, FCT Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Borges","id":"37086179021"},{"name":"Paulo Montezuma","affiliation":["Instituto de Desenvolvimento de Novas Tecnologias, Portugal","IT, Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Lisboa, Portugal","DEE, FCT Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Paulo","lastName":"Montezuma","id":"37348727400"},{"name":"Rui Dinis","affiliation":["IT, Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Lisboa, Portugal","DEE, FCT Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Dinis","id":"37269209500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4545-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4544-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4546-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7905927","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":358},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Receiving antennas","Frequency-domain analysis","Transmitting antennas","Complexity theory","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","computational complexity","equalisers","frequency-domain analysis","MIMO communication","smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity MRC-based receivers","low-complexity EGC-based receivers","SC-FDE modulation","massive MIMO scheme","high-data wireless transfer rates","smart phones","communication process","antenna arrays","multistream communication","MIMO systems","SC-FDE scheme","single-carrier frequency domain equalization","power efficiency","low-envelope fluctuation","low-complexity receivers","matrix inversion operation","IB-DFE","iterative block decision feedback equalizer","equal gain combiner scheme","maximum ratio combiner scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO systems","low complexity receivers","SC-FDE","IB-DFE"]}],"abstract":"Nowadays, the demand of high data wireless transfer rates is growing with the big and fast grow of smart phones.

Therefore a different path of ideas has been followed and the communication process has been taken to the next level by the usage of big arrays of antennas and multi-stream communication (MIMO systems) and wider bandwidths. These systems can be combined with SC-FDE (Single-Carrier Frequency Domain Equalization) schemes to improve the power efficiency in uplink due to the low envelope fluctuations.

Network densification is a promising approach to improve the area spectral efficiency, but to acquire massive channel state information (CSI) for effective interference management becomes a formidable task. In this paper, we propose a novel interference management method which only requires the network connectivity information, i.e., the knowledge of the presence of strong links, and statistical information of the weak links. To acquire such mixed network connectivity information incurs significant less overhead than complete CSI, and thus this method is scalable to large network sizes. To maximize the sum-rate with the mixed network connectivity information, we formulate a rank minimization problem to cancel strong interference and suppress weak interference, which is then solved by a Riemannian trust-region algorithm. Such algorithm is robust to initial points and has a fast convergence rate. Simulation result shows that our approach achieves a higher data rate than the state-of-the-art methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905934/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7905934/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16836603","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A low-rank approach for interference management in dense wireless networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-rank approach for interference management in dense wireless networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0000708.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055531S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897403","isNumber":"7905762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897403","xplore-issue":"7905762","articleId":"7905934","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7905941,"authors":[{"name":"Vutha Va","affiliation":["Wireless Networking and Communications Group, The University of Texas at Austin"],"firstName":"Vutha","lastName":"Va","id":"38518896800"},{"name":"Haris Vikalo","affiliation":["Wireless Networking and Communications Group, The University of Texas at Austin"],"firstName":"Haris","lastName":"Vikalo","id":"38339065600"},{"name":"Robert W.

Enabling mmWave communications requires appropriate beamforming, which is conventionally realized by a lengthy beam training process. Such beam training will be a challenge for applying mmWave to mobile environments. As a solution, a beam tracking method requiring to train only one beam pair to track a path in the analog beamforming architecture is developed. Considering its low complexity which is suitable for mobile settings, the extended Kalman filter is chosen as the tracking filter. Several effects impacting the performance of the proposed tracking algorithm, such as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and array size, are investigated. It is found that at the same SNR, narrower beams, which are more sensitive to angular changes, can provide more accurate estimate. Too narrow beams, however, degrade tracking performance because beam misalignment could happen during the measurement. Finally, a comparison to prior work is given where it is shown that our approach is more suitable for fast-changing environments thanks to the low measurement overhead.","doi":"10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905941","startPage":"743","endPage":"747","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897403/7905762/07905941.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905762","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beam tracking for mobile millimeter wave communication systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905941/","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Beam tracking for mobile millimeter wave communication systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","accessionNumber":"16836783","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7905941/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beam tracking for mobile millimeter wave communication systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0000743.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092616S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897403","isNumber":"7905762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897403","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"7905762","articleId":"7905941","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7905942,"authors":[{"name":"Che-Chuan Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Huang University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Che-Chuan","lastName":"Yeh","id":"37086123820"},{"name":"Kai-Neng Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Huang University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kai-Neng","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37085733279"},{"name":"Yuan-Hao Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Huang University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuan-Hao","lastName":"Huang","id":"37404504600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4545-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4544-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4546-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7905942","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":734},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Precoding","Optimized production technology","MIMO","Indexes","Array signal processing","Baseband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","communication complexity","correlation methods","direction-of-arrival estimation","MIMO communication","mobile radio","precoding","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity partially updated beam tracking algorithm","mmwave MIMO system","millimeter wave MIMO system","5G communication","mmwave channel","scattering","radio transmission","baseband multiple-input multiple-output precoding","beamforming","computational complexity","mobile environment","partially updated algorithm","optimal precoder-combiner correlation","continuous drifting channel model","AoA","AoD","mobile station","MS","velocity 15 km/h"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming","Beam Tracking","Hybrid Precoding","MIMO","Millimeter Wave"]}],"abstract":"Millimeter wave (mmWave) system attracts much research attention because it provides very wide bandwidth for 5G communications.

account the non-linear power amplifier (PA) efficiency in a multi-user multiple-input single-output system. The subarray selection problem is formulated using the concept of perspective formulation with additional penalty term in the objective function. To tackle the resulting challenging mixed-Boolean non-convex optimization problem, we rely on continuous relaxation and successive convex approximation framework where a convex problem is solved in each iteration. Numerical results demonstrate the achieved energy efficiency gains of the subarray selection and show that non-linear PA efficiency has a significant impact on the optimization. We also observe that on contrast to using linear PA efficiency model, the non-linear PA efficiency model yields the fact that it is better to stay silent rather than transmit with very low transmit power.","doi":"10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905945","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897403/7905762/07905945.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905945","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","startPage":"763","endPage":"767","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient joint transmit beamforming and subarray selection with non-linear power amplifier efficiency","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7905945","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient joint transmit beamforming and subarray selection with non-linear power amplifier efficiency","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905945/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7905945/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16836656","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient joint transmit beamforming and subarray selection with non-linear power amplifier efficiency","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0000763.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058296S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897403","isNumber":"7905762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897403","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7905762","articleId":"7905945","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7905955,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085504157"},{"name":"Jianshu Chen","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA"],"firstName":"Jianshu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37716524000"},{"name":"H.

A learning based approach is developed: binary classifiers are trained to approximate the maximum a-posteriori probability (MAP) detectors that each identifies the status of a distinct line. An efficient neural network architecture in which features are shared for inferences of all line statuses is developed. This architecture enjoys a significant computational complexity advantage in the training and testing processes. The developed classifiers based on neural networks are evaluated in the IEEE 30-bus system.

Energy harvesting wireless systems utilize energy from the environment and provide a green solution. On the other hand, cognitive radio (CR) wireless systems harvest spectrum from licensed users reducing spectrum crunch. These two techniques can be synthesized in an energy harvesting cognitive radio (EHCR) system to efficiently manage precious resources, i.e., power and spectrum. However, since the availability of both spectrum and energy is not deterministic, such a system can suffer from large delay at the transmission stage. This paper aims at providing an exact solution to the transmission time minimization problem of an EHCR system. The challenge comes from the multiple constraints. In addition to the available energy and spectrum constraints, the CR system will have to have peak power constraint to avoid interference to the licensed user. This results in a non-convex mixed-integer optimization problem for which we develop an exact solution using geometric water-filling with peak power constraints (GWFPP). We also use a recursion machinery to solve the delay minimization problem. Such a system will save energy for the power grid and satisfy user with low-latent communication. Numerical example and complexity analysis illustrate exactness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905970/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","accessionNumber":"16836547","htmlLink":"/document/7905970/","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Transmission time minimization of an energy harvesting cognitive radio system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission time minimization of an energy harvesting cognitive radio system","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0000886.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055705S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897403","isNumber":"7905762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897403","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7905762","articleId":"7905970","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7905986,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Amine Arfaoui","affiliation":["Texas A&M University at Qatar"],"firstName":"Mohamed Amine","lastName":"Arfaoui","id":"37086042498"},{"name":"Zouheir Rezki","affiliation":["University of Idaho"],"firstName":"Zouheir","lastName":"Rezki","id":"37294101200"},{"name":"Ali Ghrayeb","affiliation":["Texas A&M University at Qatar","Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI), Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Ghrayeb","id":"37278225300"},{"name":"Mohamed Slim Alouini","affiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Mohamed Slim","lastName":"Alouini","id":"37274291900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4545-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4544-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4546-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7905986","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":237},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7905986","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","MISO","Radio frequency","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Optimization","Robustness","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","free-space optical communication","Gaussian channels","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmitter","TGN","truncated generalized normal distribution","achievable secrecy rate","single eavesdropper","multiple-input single-output visible light communication Gaussian wiretap channel","MISO VLC wiretap channel","optimal beamforming"]}],"abstract":"We investigate in this paper the achievable secrecy rate of the multiple-input single-output (MISO) visible light communication (VLC) Gaussian wiretap channel with single user and single eavesdropper.

Specifically, a transmitter sends one confidential message to a legitimate receiver, which must be kept perfectly secure from several external multi-antenna eavesdroppers. Assuming imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter, our goal is to design the input transmit covariance, such that the worst-case secrecy energy efficiency (WC-SEE) is maximized, subject to the quality of service (QoS) and total transmit power constraints. Due to the nonconvexity of this problem, an equivalent parametric reformulation, based on the fractional programming theory, is proposed to recast this problem as a sequence of semidefinite programs. By this means, the maximum WC-SEE can be found via a root search algorithm. Moreover, we also give an approach to constructing a rank-one optimal covariance matrix of the confidential message from our proposed algorithm, which implies the optimality of transmit beamforming to achieve the maximum WC-SEE. Numerical results are presented to verify the efficacy of our proposed method.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Receivers","Optimization","Programming","Quality of

This paper describes a method for exploiting the complex information for ATR by using a convolutional neural network (CNN) that accepts fully complex input features. We show a performance leap from 87.30% to 99.21% accuracy on real collected wide-angle SAR data with the use of complex features.","doi":"10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905999","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897403/7905762/07905999.pdf","startPage":"1037","endPage":"1041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complex input convolutional neural networks for wide angle SAR ATR","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7905999/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Complex input convolutional neural networks for wide angle SAR ATR","htmlLink":"/document/7905999/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16836678","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complex input convolutional neural networks for wide angle SAR ATR","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0001037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056424S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897403","isNumber":"7905762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897403","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7905762","articleId":"7905999","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7906009,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Jiang","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37272626400"},{"name":"Wenbo Zhang","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37878498300"},{"name":"Yin Li","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Yin","lastName":"Li","id":"37085663315"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4545-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4544-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4546-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7906009","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":245},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrices","MIMO radar","Antenna arrays","Object detection","Radar antennas","Signal to noise ratio","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","covariance matrices","deconvolution","MIMO radar","object detection","probability","radar cross-sections","radar detection","radar signal processing","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["target detection","RCS amplitude estimation","large-scale MIMO radar","free probability theory","large-scale multiple-input multiple-output radar","array antennas","snapshots","radar signal processing methods","statistical covariance matrix","FPT","MIMO radar echo signals","high-dimensional random matrix","asymptotic free behavior","multiplicative free deconvolution","eigenvalues","Newton-Girard formula","target existence","radar cross section","RCS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO radar","target detection","free probability theory","large dimensional random matrix"]}],"abstract":"In the paper, we consider large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar, in which the numbers of array antennas and snapshots are in the same order of magnitude.

In addition, the ST (jammer) does not know the channels' gains of the jammer (ST). After sensing each of the frequency bands, the ST and the jammer decide how to transmit information and how to block these transmissions respectively. In this respect, both the ST and the jammer incur a communication cost and the SR sends an acknowledgment (ACK) if it decodes the information correctly. Otherwise, it sends a negative ACK (NACK). The strategic and distributed power allocation between the ST and the jammer is modeled as a stochastic game in which we employ a multiplicative weight no-regret learning mechanism to obtain an equilibrium point.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906013/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","accessionNumber":"16836649","htmlLink":"/document/7906013/","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Learning equilibria for power allocation games in cognitive radio networks with a jammer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning equilibria for power allocation games in cognitive radio networks with a jammer","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0001104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082557S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897403","isNumber":"7905762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897403","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7905762","articleId":"7906013","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7906015,"authors":[{"name":"Janis N\u00f6tzel","affiliation":["F\u00edsica Te\u00f2rica: Informaci\u00f3 i Fen\u00f2mens Qu\u00e0ntics, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain","Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Theoretische Informationstechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Janis","lastName":"N\u00f6tzel","id":"38193630000"},{"name":"Christian Arendt","affiliation":["BMW Group, M\u00fcnchen, Germany","Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Theoretische Informationstechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Arendt","id":"37085993520"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4545-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4544-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4546-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7906015","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906015","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Fading channels","Antenna arrays","Context","Probability distribution","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antennas","channel estimation","demodulation","error statistics","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel statistics","error correction","bit error rate estimation","central processing unit","bit stream","predecoding","demodulation","DAS","spatially separated antennas","vehicular connectivity","distributed antenna systems","blind channel estimation","dependent component analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["vehicular connectivity","distributed antenna systems","unsupervised learning","blind estimation","dependent component analysis"]}],"abstract":"This contribution is motivated by a key question that car manufacturers have to face in the context of vehicular connectivity: What is the benefit of a higher number of spatially separated antennas mounted on a vehicle resulting in a so-called `distributed antenna system' (DAS)? We study this question in a situation where demodulation and pre-decoding of the incoming signal is performed independently at each antenna. The resulting bit stream is fed to a central processing unit, where bit error rate estimation and error correction are performed. It turns out that an increase in number of antennas from 1 to 2-5 unleashes completely new features of the antenna system. In this contribution, we provide the conceptual study of an algorithm that exploits these new features. It has the advantage of learning the channel statistics blindly-no pilot sequences are necessary in an idealized scenario.","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897403/7905762/07906015.pdf","startPage":"1116","endPage":"1121","doi":"10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7906015","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7906015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905762","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using dependent component analysis for blind channel estimation in distributed antenna systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906015/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Using dependent component analysis for blind channel estimation in distributed antenna systems","htmlLink":"/document/7906015/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","accessionNumber":"16836646","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using dependent component analysis for blind channel estimation in distributed antenna systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0001116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0503S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897403","isNumber":"7905762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897403","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7905762","articleId":"7906015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7906016,"authors":[{"name":"Kareem Bonna","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rutgers University"],"firstName":"Kareem","lastName":"Bonna","id":"37086178213"},{"name":"Predrag Spasojevi\u0107","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rutgers University"],"firstName":"Predrag","lastName":"Spasojevi\u0107","id":"37282992100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4545-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4544-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4546-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7906016","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"abstract":"Single Input Multiple Output (SIMO) Blind Channel Identification (BCI) using Subspace-based Methods, notably the Cross-Relations (CR) and Noise-Subspace (SS) Methods, are sensitive to selection of the channel order.

deep learning of big EEG data for epileptic seizure prediction","abstract":"Developing a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for seizure prediction can help epileptic patients have a better quality of life. However, there are many difficulties and challenges in developing such a system as a real-life support for patients. Because of the nonstationary nature of EEG signals, normal and seizure patterns vary across different patients. Thus, finding a group of manually extracted features for the prediction task is not practical. Moreover, when using implanted electrodes for brain recording massive amounts of data are produced. This big data calls for the need for safe storage and high computational resources for real-time processing. To address these challenges, a cloud-based BCI system for the analysis of this big EEG data is presented. First, a dimensionality-reduction technique is developed to increase classification accuracy as well as to decrease the communication bandwidth and computation time. Second, following a deep-learning approach, a stacked autoencoder is trained in two steps for unsupervised feature extraction and classification. Third, a cloud-computing solution is proposed for real-time analysis of big EEG data. The results on a benchmark clinical dataset illustrate the superiority of the proposed patient-specific BCI as an alternative method and its expected usefulness in real-life support of epilepsy patients.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906022/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16836672","htmlLink":"/document/7906022/","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cloud-based deep learning of big EEG data for epileptic seizure prediction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud-based deep learning of big EEG data for epileptic seizure prediction","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0001151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.260324S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897403","isNumber":"7905762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897403","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7905762","articleId":"7906022","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7906025,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmoud Essalat","affiliation":["Advanced Communications Research Institute (ACRI), Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Essalat","id":"37085991215"},{"name":"Mahdi Boloursaz Mashhadi","affiliation":["Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Tehran, IR"],"firstName":"Mahdi Boloursaz","lastName":"Mashhadi","id":"37085996506"},{"name":"Farokh Marvasti","affiliation":["Advanced Communications Research Institute (ACRI), Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Farokh","lastName":"Marvasti","id":"37356612700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4545-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4544-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4546-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7906025","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":546},"abstract":"PPG based heart rate (HR) monitoring has recently attracted much attention with the advent of wearable devices such as smart watches and smart bands. However, due to severe motion artifacts (MA) caused by wristband stumbles, PPG based HR monitoring is a challenging problem in scenarios where the subject performs intensive physical exercises. This work proposes a novel approach to the problem based on supervised learning by Neural Network (NN). By simulations on the benchmark datasets [1], we achieve acceptable estimation accuracy and improved run time in comparison with the literature. A major contribution of this work is that it alleviates the need to use simultaneous acceleration signals. The simulation results show that although the proposed method does not process the simultaneous acceleration signals, it still achieves the acceptable Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.39 Beats Per Minute (BPM) on the benchmark data set.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Signal processing","Biology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","medical signal processing","photoplethysmography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["supervised heart rate tracking","wrist-type photoplethysmographic signals","wearable devices","smart watches","smart bands","motion artifacts","wristband stumbles","PPG based HR monitoring","supervised learning","neural network","NN","benchmark datasets","mean absolute error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Photoplethysmograph (PPG)","Heart Rate Monitoring","Neural Network","Motion Artifact Reduction","Simultaneous Acceleration Signals"]}],"doi":"10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7906025","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897403/7905762/07906025.pdf","startPage":"1166","endPage":"1170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7906025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supervised heart rate tracking using wrist-type photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals during physical exercise without simultaneous acceleration signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906025","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Supervised heart rate tracking using wrist-type photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals during physical exercise without simultaneous acceleration signals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906025/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7906025/","accessionNumber":"16836636","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supervised heart rate tracking using wrist-type photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals during physical exercise without simultaneous acceleration signals","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0001166.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055145S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897403","isNumber":"7905762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897403","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7905762","articleId":"7906025","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":7906044,"authors":[{"name":"Luiz F.

Still, sampling set selection remains an open issue. Indeed, although conditions for graph signal reconstruction from noiseless samples were derived, the presence of noise makes sampling set selection combinatorial and NP-hard in general. Performance bounds are available only for randomized sampling schemes, even though greedy search remains ubiquitous in practice. This work sets out to justify the success of greedy sampling by introducing the concept of approximate supermodularity and updating the classical greedy bound to account for this class of functions. Then, it quantifies the approximate supermodularity of two important reconstruction figures of merit, namely the log det of the error covariance matrix and the mean-square error, showing that they can be optimized with worst-case guarantees using greedy sampling.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906044/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7906044/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16836811","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Near-optimality of greedy set selection in the sampling of graph signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-optimality of greedy set selection in the sampling of graph signals","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0001265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067132S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897403","isNumber":"7905762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897403","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7905762","articleId":"7906044","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":7906055,"authors":[{"name":"Mostafa Rahman\u0131","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Mostafa","lastName":"Rahman\u0131","id":"38232527600"},{"name":"George Atia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Atia","id":"37284105700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4545-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4544-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4546-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7906055","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Principal component analysis","Data models","Computational complexity","Standards","Sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","learning (artificial intelligence)","principal component analysis","random processes","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust PCA approach","random column-row sampling method","robust principal component analysis","data sketch","full scale data","computational complexity","sample characterization","sample complexity","mathematical analysis","numerical simulations","robust subspace learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Robust PCA","Randomized Method","Outlier","Big Data","Subspace Recovery","Low Rank Matrix","Data Sketching"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906055","doi":"10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7906055","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7906055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905762","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897403/7905762/07906055.pdf","startPage":"1320","endPage":"1324","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable and robust PCA approach with random column/row sampling","abstract":"This paper develops and analyzes a randomized design for robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

We assume that the distributed nodes observe sparse signals which share the same but unknown sparsity pattern. Each node obtains measurements via random projections and further quantizes its measurement vector element-wise to 1-bit. We develop two decentralized variants of the binary iterative hard thresholding (BIHT) algorithm where each node communicates only with its one hop neighbors and exchanges its measurement information. This stage is followed by index fusion stage. For first and second algorithms, index fusion is performed at the end of and during BIHT iterations, respectively. The global estimate of the support set in both the algorithms is obtained by fusing all the final local estimates. Experimental results show that the proposed collaborative algorithms have better (or at least similar) performance compared to the centralized version.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897403/7905762/07906062.pdf","startPage":"1354","endPage":"1358","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","doi":"10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7906062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7906062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905762","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized joint sparsity pattern recovery using 1-bit compressive sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Q measurement","Indexes","Signal processing algorithms","Peer-to-peer computing","Covariance matrices","Sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","iterative methods","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decentralized joint sparsity pattern recovery","1-bit compressive sensing","1-bit compressive measurements","sparse signals","sparsity pattern","measurement vector","binary iterative hard thresholding","index fusion stage","BIHT iterations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing","1-bit compressive sensing","sparsity pattern recovery","information fusion","binary iterative hard thresholding (BIHT)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906062/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized joint sparsity pattern recovery using 1-bit compressive sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7906062/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16836625","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized joint sparsity pattern recovery using 1-bit compressive sensing","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0001354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07815S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897403","isNumber":"7905762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897403","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7905762","articleId":"7906062","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7906064,"authors":[{"name":"Heeseong Yang","affiliation":["KAIST, Department of Electrical Engineering, Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Heeseong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085350243"},{"name":"Joohwan Chun","affiliation":["KAIST, Department of Electrical Engineering, Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Joohwan","lastName":"Chun","id":"37272877200"},{"name":"Haris Vikalo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Haris","lastName":"Vikalo","id":"38339065600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4545-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4544-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4546-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7906064","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Direction-of-arrival estimation","Estimation","Merging","Linear antenna arrays","Covariance matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","computational complexity","convergence","direction-of-arrival estimation","signal classification","smoothing methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonnegative gridless compressive sensing","coprime arrays","direction-of-arrival estimation","DOA","atomic norm minimization","successive-atom-merging cyclic coordinate descent","atom update","continuous space subdomains","atom merging","fast convergence","feasible computational complexity","joint sparsity reconstruction method","JLASSO","MUSIC method","spatial smoothing","SS-MUSIC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["gridless compressive sensing","co-prime arrays","direction of arrival","line spectral estimation"]}],"abstract":"The direction-of-arrival estimation in co-prime arrays is formulated as gridless compressive sensing where the atoms can be anywhere in a continuous domain.

In this paper, we investigate and compare two deterministic algorithms for taking measurements based on a compressive-sensing-based approach for rapid and reliable detection of faulty elements in massive multi-input multi-output antenna arrays. We exploit the fact that the measurement matrix for a uniform linear antenna array reduces to a partial discrete Fourier transform matrix with rows corresponding to the measurements' locations. With the aid of the investigated algorithms, the measurements can be wisely taken to reduce the measurement matrix's worst-case coherence, which affects the detection probability of the defective antenna elements. In particular, one of the algorithms aims at constructing a measurement matrix with fewer distinct inner product values to reduce the worst-case coherence. The second algorithm is based on bounding the inner product between any pair of measurement matrix columns. Our study shows that uniform measurements can adversely affect the detection probability of the defective antenna elements, while using either one of the investigated deterministic algorithms leads to remarkable performance improvement.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906069/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7906069/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16836754","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Deterministic measurement procedures for diagnosis of massive uniform linear antenna arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deterministic measurement procedures for diagnosis of massive uniform linear antenna arrays","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0001388.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052697S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897403","isNumber":"7905762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897403","xplore-issue":"7905762","articleId":"7906069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7906074,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Wang","affiliation":["Research Department, Hisilicon Technologies Co.

However, existing CS-based channel estimation (CSCE) methods have to deal with a large-size reconstruction problem for sparse channel recovery, which causes high computational cost and long computation time. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a fast channel estimation (FCE) technique. It utilizes the fact that the sparse structure of the channel matrix can be mapped to reveal useful channel parameters such as the angular and fading information of propagation paths. Based on such mapping, we decouple the channel estimation problem into three sub-problems: angle of arrival detection, angle of departure detection, and path gain estimation. The three sub-problems have reduced size and are solved sequentially, resulting in much lower complexity. Numerical results show that the FCE method runs much faster than the CSCE method to achieve the same accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast channel estimation approach for millimeter-wave massive MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","doi":"10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7906074","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897403/7905762/07906074.pdf","startPage":"1413","endPage":"1417","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7906074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905762","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906074","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906074/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A fast channel estimation approach for millimeter-wave massive MIMO systems","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7906074/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16836614","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast channel estimation approach for millimeter-wave massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0001413.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054479S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897403","isNumber":"7905762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897403","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7905762","articleId":"7906074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7906076,"authors":[{"name":"Tilahun Melkamu Getu","affiliation":["Ecole de technologie superieure, Montreal, QC, CA"],"firstName":"Tilahun Melkamu","lastName":"Getu","id":"37085647282"},{"name":"Wessam Ajib","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00c0 Montr\u00e9al (UQ\u00c0M), Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Wessam","lastName":"Ajib","id":"37294527900"},{"name":"Rene Landry","affiliation":["Ecole de technologie superieure, Montreal, QC, CA"],"firstName":"Rene","lastName":"Landry","id":"37282943300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4545-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4544-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4546-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7906076","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","radiofrequency interference","signal processing","tensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["oversampling-based algorithm","RF interference excision efficiency","SIMO systems","unintentional interferers","intentional interferers","radiofrequency interference","terrestrial communications","satellite communications","tensor-based signal processing","oversampled multilinear subspace estimation and projection algorithm","o-MLSEP algorithm","MI-RFI excision","single-input multiple-output systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RFI","RFI excision","oversampling","multi-linear subspace estimation","multi-linear projection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906076","doi":"10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7906076","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7906076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905762","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897403/7905762/07906076.pdf","startPage":"1423","endPage":"1427","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Oversampling-based algorithm for efficient RF interference excision in SIMO systems","abstract":"For intentional or unintentional interferers, radio frequency interference (RFI) is being prevalent in both satellite and terrestrial communications.

Recently, a lot of attention was drawn to the problem of recovering the sparse vector from quantized CS measurements. Especially interesting is the case, when extreme quantization is enforced that captures only the sign of the measurements. The problem becomes even more difficult if the measurements are corrupted by noise. In this paper we consider additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). To solve this problem, we employ the highly efficient generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm and provide closed-form expressions for the nonlinear steps.

Recently, it has been shown that the temporal correlation between neighboring frames can be exploited in order to enhance the reconstruction quality of non-regularly sampled video data. In this paper, a new recursive multi-frame reconstruction approach is proposed in order to further increase the reconstruction quality. By using a new reference order, previously reconstructed frames can be used for the subsequent motion estimation and a new weighting function allows for the incorporation of multiple pixels projected onto the same position. With the new recursive multi-frame approach, a visually noticeable average gain in PSNR of up to 1.13 dB with respect to a state-of-the-art single-frame reconstruction approach can be achieved. Compared to the existing multi-frame approach, a gain of 0.31 dB is possible. SSIM results show the same behavior as PSNR results. Additionally, the pre-reconstruction step of the existing multi-frame approach can be avoided and the new algorithm is, in general, capable of real-time processing.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Motion estimation","Spatial resolution","Gain","Signal resolution","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image enhancement","image reconstruction","image resolution","image sampling","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recursive frequency selective reconstruction","nonregularly sampled video data","high resolution images","image enhancement"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PCS.2016.7906325","publicationTitle":"2016 Picture Coding Symposium (PCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Picture Coding Symposium (PCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897355/7906305/07906325.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7906305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCS.2016.7906325","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recursive frequency selective reconstruction of non-regularly sampled video data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906325","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Recursive frequency selective reconstruction of non-regularly sampled video data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906325/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2016","htmlLink":"/document/7906325/","accessionNumber":"16836467","conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recursive frequency selective reconstruction of non-regularly sampled video data","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"a17jonscher.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110274S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897355","isNumber":"7906305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897355","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7906305","articleId":"7906325","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7906327,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Herglotz","affiliation":["Chair of Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU)"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Herglotz","id":"38469335300"},{"name":"Rafael Rosales","affiliation":["Chair of Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU)"],"firstName":"Rafael","lastName":"Rosales","id":"38021056700"},{"name":"Michael Gla\u00df","affiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Bayern, DE"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Gla\u00df","id":"37087069528"},{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Teich","affiliation":["Chair of Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU)"],"firstName":"J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Teich","id":"37276355800"},{"name":"Andr\u00e9 Kaup","affiliation":["Chair of Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU)"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e9","lastName":"Kaup","id":"37285096200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5966-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5967-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7822"}],"articleNumber":"7906327","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"abstract":"Finding the best possible encoding decisions for compressing a video sequence is a highly complex problem.

Interest (ROI) coding is a common method for data reduction in scenarios where bandwidth is crucial like in aerial video surveillance from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In order to save bits, non-ROI areas are typically reduced in quality or not transmitted at all and thus, an accurate ROI classification is mandatory. Moving objects (MOs) are often considered as ROIs and consequently have to be accurately detected onboard. However, common detection approaches either rely on computationally demanding processing which is not available at small UAVs with only limited energy, are model based or cannot provide a sufficient detection precision. While not detected MOs lead to a degraded representation at the decoder, erroneously detected MOs lead to an unnecessary high bit rate. We tackle all these issues utilizing an efficient object proposal computation. Based on a dual-threshold strategy applied to image differences, we propose a linear prediction-supported block matcher. Compared to a simple thresholding approach, it shows superior performance and is robust to threshold tuning. By integrating superpixels into the framework, we further recover the complete shape of the MOs. Finally, an efficient tracking-by-detection system is employed to produce accurate detections from the proposals, thereby recovering missed MOs and denying wrong proposals, making the coding more efficient. We achieve an improved detection precision of up to 76 % compared to a simple difference image-based approach. By using a general ROI coding framework we reduce the bit rate of our test set by 70 % compared to common HEVC.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Moving object tracking for aerial video coding using linear motion prediction and block matching","publicationTitle":"2016 Picture Coding Symposium (PCS)","doi":"10.1109/PCS.2016.7906333","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Picture Coding Symposium (PCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897355/7906305/07906333.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCS.2016.7906333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7906305","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906333","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906333/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Moving object tracking for aerial video coding using linear motion prediction and block matching","conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7906333/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16836447","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Moving object tracking for aerial video coding using linear motion prediction and block matching","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"a25meuel.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086643S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897355","isNumber":"7906305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897355","xplore-issue":"7906305","articleId":"7906333","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7906342,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Chi Chen","affiliation":["InterDigital Communications, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chun-Chi","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086028690"},{"name":"Xiaoyu Xiu","affiliation":["InterDigital Communications, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaoyu","lastName":"Xiu","id":"37403037400"},{"name":"Yuwen He","affiliation":["InterDigital Communications, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yuwen","lastName":"He","id":"37085405131"},{"name":"Yan Ye","affiliation":["InterDigital Communications, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Ye","id":"37085498465"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5966-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5967-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7822"}],"articleNumber":"7906342","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":353},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Integrated circuits","Encoding","Lighting","Motion compensation","Bidirectional control","Adaptive optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized biprediction method","video coding","GBi technique","biprediction weights","prediction unit level","PU level","CU level","coding unit level","weight value","inter coding tools","merge mode","affine prediction","JEM-2.0 anchor","decoding burden"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a generalized bi-prediction (GBi) technique to extend the notion of the existing weighted bi-prediction to prediction unit (PU) level.

The candidate set of weights in the GBi mode includes a total of 7 weights, including 1/2 used for conventional bi-prediction. An index pointing to the entry of a weight value in the candidate weight set is signaled. At most one index per CU is signaled and the corresponding weight values are shared across all the bi-prediction PUs and all color components in that CU. Besides, GBi can also be extended to inter coding tools, such as, merge mode and affine prediction that support bi-prediction.

The successive generations of standard have always found a better way to further de-correlate the residual signals and thus improve the coding efficiency. Recently, MPEG and the ITU have jointly launched the Joint Video Exploration Team (or JVET) to prepare the next generation of video coding standard. In this context, a new approach called Adaptive Multiple Transforms (or AMT) has been introduced. Despite the provided coding efficiency, the AMT solution raises several issues especially regarding the complexity of the selected set of transforms. This can be an important issue, particularly for a future industrial adoption. In this paper, a low-complexity transform set for AMT is proposed, which aims at providing a significant reduction of the required computational power. The proposed method has been implemented in the JEM-2.0 and tested under the JVET test conditions where it provides a substantial complexity reduction of -56.5% compared to the current AMT transform set with similar R-D performance.","doi":"10.1109/PCS.2016.7906348","publicationTitle":"2016 Picture Coding Symposium (PCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Picture Coding Symposium (PCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897355/7906305/07906348.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCS.2016.7906348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7906305","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity adaptive multiple transforms for post-HEVC video coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906348","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity adaptive multiple transforms for post-HEVC video coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906348/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16836441","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7906348/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity adaptive multiple transforms for post-HEVC video coding","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"a40biatek.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088446S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897355","isNumber":"7906305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897355","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7906305","articleId":"7906348","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7906359,"authors":[{"name":"Zhe Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Zhe","lastName":"Wang","id":"37857245700"},{"name":"Yousef Baroud","affiliation":["Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Yousef","lastName":"Baroud","id":"37085642470"},{"name":"Seyyed Mahdi Najmabadi","affiliation":["Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Seyyed Mahdi","lastName":"Najmabadi","id":"37085637131"},{"name":"Sven Simon","affiliation":["Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Sven","lastName":"Simon","id":"37266660100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5966-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5967-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7822"}],"articleNumber":"7906359","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"abstract":"A pixel domain algorithm for low complexity perceptual image coding is proposed.

The downsampled pixel is encoded if the differences are within the JND thresholds, and otherwise the original pixels are encoded with a quantization parameter selected based on the JND model. Noise shaping is employed to suppress potential visual artifacts due to quantization error propagation. The coding error at any pixel location can be guaranteed to be within the corresponding JND threshold.

Moreover, a measurement rate allocation algorithm is also proposed, which utilizes the rate-distortion optimization (RDO) to allocate the measurement rate for each block.

Initial experiments show that at very low bit rates the SMoE approach can provide competitive performance to H.264.","doi":"10.1109/PCS.2016.7906369","publicationTitle":"2016 Picture Coding Symposium (PCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Picture Coding Symposium (PCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897355/7906305/07906369.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCS.2016.7906369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7906305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video representation and coding using a sparse steered mixture-of-experts network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906369/","displayDocTitle":"Video representation and coding using a sparse steered mixture-of-experts network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16836475","htmlLink":"/document/7906369/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video representation and coding using a sparse steered mixture-of-experts network","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"a61lange.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057678S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897355","isNumber":"7906305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897355","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7906305","articleId":"7906369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7906371,"authors":[{"name":"Masaki Onuki","affiliation":["Graduate School of BASE, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Koganei, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaki","lastName":"Onuki","id":"37085436002"},{"name":"Yuichi Tanaka","affiliation":["Graduate School of BASE, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Koganei, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuichi","lastName":"Tanaka","id":"37396738600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5966-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5967-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7822"}],"articleNumber":"7906371","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Transform coding","Transforms","Convex functions","Optimization methods","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","frequency-domain analysis","image coding","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["\u21131-regularized optimization","undersampled prefilters","de facto image coding method","convex optimization method","low bit rate case","undersampled time-domain lapped transform","cost function minimization","frequency domain","alternating direction method","multipliers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906371","doi":"10.1109/PCS.2016.7906371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCS.2016.7906371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7906305","publicationTitle":"2016 Picture Coding Symposium (PCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Picture Coding Symposium (PCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897355/7906305/07906371.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"\u2113<inf>1</inf>-Regularized optimization of undersampled prefilters for image coding","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a convex optimization method of prefilters for image coding. JPEG, which is the de facto image coding method, generally produces some errors, e.g., blocking artifacts, under the low bit rate case. The undersampled time-domain lapped transform (TDLT) can efficiently reduce the errors. To improve the performance of the undersampled TDLT, its prefilter is determined by minimizing the errors between the original image and the image upsampled from the downsampled one. This approach enhances the performance but there exists a room for further improvements since the image derived by the prefilter would not become a smoothed image whose charactaristic is important for image coding.

This paper evaluates how encoders targeting a parallel architecture such as a GPU can increase their throughput in use cases where very high data rates are used. The compression efficiency in the less significant bit-planes is then often poor and it is beneficial to enable the Selective Arithmetic Coding Bypass style (fast mode) in order to trade a small loss in compression efficiency for a reduction of the computational complexity. More importantly, this style exposes a more finely grained parallelism that can be exploited to execute the raw coding passes, including bit-stuffing, in a sample-parallel fashion. For a latency-or memory critical application that encodes one frame at a time, EBCOT's tier-1 is sped up between 1.1x and 2.4x compared to an optimized GPU-based implementation. When a low GPU occupancy has already been addressed by encoding multiple frames in parallel, the throughput can still be improved by 5% for high-entropy images and 27% for low-entropy images. Best results are obtained when enabling the fast mode after the fourth significant bit-plane. For most of the test images the compression rate is within 1% of the original.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7906305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCS.2016.7906388","publicationTitle":"2016 Picture Coding Symposium (PCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Picture Coding Symposium (PCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897355/7906305/07906388.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/PCS.2016.7906388","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sample-parallel execution of EBCOT in fast mode","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Sample-parallel execution of EBCOT in fast mode","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7906388/","publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16836424","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906388/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sample-parallel execution of EBCOT in fast mode","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"a80bruns.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05505S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897355","isNumber":"7906305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897355","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7906305","articleId":"7906388","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7906392,"authors":[{"name":"Rujun Wei","affiliation":["Cooperative Medianet Innovation Center, Shanghai, China","Institute of Image Communication and Network Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University","The State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University"],"firstName":"Rujun","lastName":"Wei","id":"37085610988"},{"name":"Rong Xie","affiliation":["Cooperative Medianet Innovation Center, Shanghai, China","Institute of Image Communication and Network Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Xie","id":"37543843900"},{"name":"Li Song","affiliation":["Cooperative Medianet Innovation Center, Shanghai, China","Institute of Image Communication and Network Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University","The State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Song","id":"37399512900"},{"name":"Liang Zhang","affiliation":["Cooperative Medianet Innovation Center, Shanghai, China","Institute of Image Communication and Network Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085357539"},{"name":"Wenjun Zhang","affiliation":["Cooperative Medianet Innovation Center, Shanghai, China","Institute of Image Communication and Network Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"],"firstName":"Wenjun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37278428800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5966-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5967-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7822"}],"articleNumber":"7906392","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":171},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filtering algorithms","Encoding","Interpolation","Filtering","Prediction algorithms","Software","Video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","interpolation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved intraangular prediction method","interpolation filter","boundary filter","four-tap interpolation filter algorithm","fractional position","Gaussian interpolation filter","DCT-based filter","extended boundary prediction filter","prediction error reduction","AI configuration","coding gain","HEVC reference software"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906392","abstract":"In this paper, two improved intra angular prediction methods are proposed to enhance coding performance.

The most commonly used projection format is the equirectangular panoramic projection, which results into a significant amount of redundant samples in the polar areas. The redundant samples incur extra bitrate and increase the encoding/decoding time. In this paper, we study regional down-sampling (RDS) for achieving better compression and smaller encoding/decoding time for omnidirectional content. We extend the persistent RDS method applied equally to all pictures to be applied to selected pictures only in our proposed temporal RDS method and then compare the persistent and temporal RDS methods. The simulation results indicate that both the persistent and temporal RDS improve the rate-distortion (RD) performance compared to the conventional coding of equirectangular panoramas, while the temporal RDS method has less sequence-wise RD performance variation and slightly better RD performance on average when compared to the persistent RDS technique. Alongside the coding methods, we study spherical quality measurement methods for VR images/video and analyze the coding methods with these quality metrics. Moreover, we propose a uniformly sampled spherical quality metric in order to evaluate the coding distortion of omnidirectional videos.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7906305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCS.2016.7906403","publicationTitle":"2016 Picture Coding Symposium (PCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Picture Coding Symposium (PCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7897355/7906305/07906403.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/PCS.2016.7906403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of regional down-sampling methods for coding of omnidirectional video","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of regional down-sampling methods for coding of omnidirectional video","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7906403/","publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16836432","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906403/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of regional down-sampling methods for coding of omnidirectional video","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"a95ghaznaviyouvalari.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041764S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7897355","isNumber":"7906305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7897355","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7906305","articleId":"7906403","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7906471,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaojie Sun","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8039128/7906471/sun-2696381-small.gif","p":["Zhaojie Sun received the B.S. degree in mathematical sciences in\n 2013, from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, where he is currently working\n toward the Ph.D. degree with the National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications.

In this paper, a novel EDAS-equivalent criterion, relaying on matrix dimension reduction, is proposed to reduce the search complexity. Based upon this criterion, for small-scale SM-MIMO systems, a pair of transmit antenna selection (TAS) schemes, namely, the tree search based antenna selection (TSAS), and the decremental antenna selection (D-AS) schemes, are developed. Specifically, the TSAS scheme works by iteratively splitting the original Euclidean distance (ED) matrix into submatrices with smaller dimensions. TSAS achieves the same bit error rate (BER) performance as that of the exhaustive search at the cost of exponential search complexity. To address this issue, D-AS is carried out by excluding one specific transmit antenna from all the possible candidates in each iteration based on the channel information. D-AS is able to offer a near-optimal BER performance with a further reduction in terms of the search complexity. Moreover, we extend the D-AS scheme to LS-SM-MIMO systems by sorting all the ED elements with the low-complexity heapsort algorithm. Our simulation results show that the proposed D-AS algorithm outperforms conventional TAS schemes conceived for LS-SM-MIMO systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit Antenna Selection Schemes for Spatial Modulation Systems: Search Complexity Reduction and Large-Scale MIMO Applications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2696381","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8039128/07906471.pdf","startPage":"8010","endPage":"8021","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2696381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8039128","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906471","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906471/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Transmit Antenna Selection Schemes for Spatial Modulation Systems: Search Complexity Reduction and Large-Scale MIMO Applications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7906471/","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17188061","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501095 and 61671134"},{"fundingName":"National High-Tech R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2015AA01A709"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Fund of National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University","grantNumber":"2015D09"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit Antenna Selection Schemes for Spatial Modulation Systems: Search Complexity Reduction and Large-Scale MIMO Applications","sourcePdf":"tvt-xiao-2696381-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161365S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8039128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"8039128","articleId":"7906471","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7906479,"authors":[{"name":"Carsten Wulff","affiliation":["Nordic Semiconductor ASA, Trondheim, Norway","Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7956372/7906479/wulff-2685463-small.gif","p":["Carsten Wulff (M\u201908) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D., with a focus on open-loop sigma-delta modulators and analog-to-digital converters in nanoscale CMOS technologies, degrees in electrical engineering from the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway, in 2002 and 2008, respectively.","From 2006 to 2007, he was a Visiting Researcher with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.

We first evaluate the individual secrecy performance by deriving the closed-form expressions in terms of positive secrecy capacity probability, secrecy outage probability, and effective secrecy throughput (EST). Besides the expected impact of the SIC order, we find, in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, the secrecy performance is only determined by the transmitter's relative distance to eavesdropper over legitimate receiver rather than the SNR. Such a result prompts us to propose an SIC order scheduling scheme (alternative scheme) on basis of the transmitters' relative distances from the shortest to the longest. It is proved optimal in achieving total maximum EST in high SNR regime. Finally, we also investigate the problem of optimal power allocation to each transmitter under the constraint of the limited total power. An interesting solution to this problem is disclosed with the aid of numerical analysis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ZF-SIC Based Individual Secrecy in SIMO Multiple Access Wiretap Channel","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2696032","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07906483.pdf","startPage":"7244","endPage":"7253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2696032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906483","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906483/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","displayDocTitle":"ZF-SIC Based Individual Secrecy in SIMO Multiple Access Wiretap Channel","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7906483/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"16904696","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572070 and 61371069"},{"fundingName":"Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education","grantNumber":"20130009110015"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"ZF-SIC Based Individual Secrecy in SIMO Multiple Access Wiretap Channel","sourcePdf":"access-jiang-2696032-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122393S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7906483","onlineDate":"20 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7906492,"authors":[{"name":"Lipeng Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Lipeng Zhu (S\u201914) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in\n electrical engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2012, and from Wuhan\n University, Wuhan, China, in 2015, respectively.

However, the fact that instability events rarely occur would lead to a challenging class imbalance problem. Besides, short-term feature extraction from scarce instability seems extremely difficult for conventional learning machines. Faced with such a dilemma, this paper develops a systematic imbalance learning machine for online short-term voltage stability assessment. A powerful time series shapelet (discriminative subsequence) classification method is embedded into the machine for sequential transient feature mining. A forecasting-based nonlinear synthetic minority oversampling technique is proposed to mitigate the distortion of class distribution. Cost-sensitive learning is employed to intensify bias toward those scarce yet valuable unstable cases. Furthermore, an incremental learning strategy is put forward for online monitoring, contributing to adaptability and reliability enhancement along with time. Simulation results on the Nordic test system illustrate the high performance of the proposed learning machine and of the assessment scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2017.2696534","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2017.2696534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8059716","startPage":"2533","endPage":"2543","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8059716/07906492.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906492","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system stability","Voltage measurement","Stability criteria","Power system dynamics","Thermal stability","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","power engineering computing","power system dynamic stability","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["systematic imbalance learning machine","sequential transient feature mining","cost-sensitive learning","Nordic test system","incremental learning","synchrophasor measurements","feature extraction","short-term voltage stability assessment","machine learning","power system dynamic stability assessment","time series shapelet classification","nonlinear synthetic minority oversampling","online monitoring"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Class imbalance","cost-sensitive","incremental learning","phasor measurements","shapelets","short-term voltage stability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Imbalance Learning Machine-Based Power System Short-Term Voltage Stability Assessment","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17240784","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7906492/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 April 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906492/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51677097"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Imbalance Learning Machine-Based Power System Short-Term Voltage Stability Assessment","sourcePdf":"tii-lu-2696534-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082685S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8059716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"8059716","articleId":"7906492","onlineDate":"20 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":7906494,"authors":[{"name":"Mahdieh S.

The main advantage of the proposed control strategy is that it guarantees stability and satisfactory transient performance against the variations of grid impedance. Moreover, it is able to decouple the d and q channels of the control system, which enables independent regulation of the real and reactive output power of the DG unit.

For the architecture of the compact full duplex radio, we combine an analog self-interference canceler-based dual polarization with high cross-polarization discrimination and long-term evolution (LTE)-based per-subcarrier digital self-interference canceler. While we consider the compactness and power efficiency of an analog solution, we focus on the digital canceler design with robustness to a frequency-selective channel and high compatibility with a conventional LTE system. For an over-the-air wireless experiment of full duplex testbed with a two-user-pair, we implement a full duplex MIMO physical layer, supporting 20-MHz bandwidth, on an Field-Programmable Gate Array-based software-defined radio platform. Furthermore, we propose a novel timing synchronization method to construct a more viable full duplex MIMO link. By having the full duplex link prototype fully operating in real time, we present the first characterization of the proposed compact full duplex MIMO performance depending on the transmit power of the full duplex node. We also show the link quality between nodes. One of the crucial insights of this paper is that the full duplex operation of a user is capable of acquiring the throughput gain if the user has self-interference capability with guaranteed performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07906500.pdf","startPage":"16601","endPage":"16617","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2690904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2690904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact Full Duplex MIMO Radios in D2D Underlaid Cellular Networks: From System Design to Prototype Results","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Device-to-device communication","MIMO","Interference","Prototypes","Throughput","Transmitting antennas","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","field programmable gate arrays","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","radio equipment","radiofrequency interference","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software defined radio platform","field programmable gate array","full duplex MIMO physical layer","conventional LTE system","frequency selective channel","digital canceler design","persubcarrier digital self-interference canceler","LTE","long-term evolution","cross-polarization discrimination","dual polarization","analog self-interference canceler","device-to-device","cellular link","MIMO architecture","full duplex multiple-input multiple-output architecture","D2D underlaid cellular networks","compact full duplex MIMO radios"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Full duplex MIMO radio","self-interference cancellation","device-to-device communication","cellular networks"]}],"topic":"Recent Advances in Full-Duplex Radios and Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906500/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Compact Full Duplex MIMO Radios in D2D Underlaid Cellular Networks: From System Design to Prototype Results","volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7906500/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17140309","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"MSIP (Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning), South Korea, through the IT Consilience Creative Program supervised by the Institute for Information & Communications Technology Promotion (IITP)","grantNumber":"IITP-2017-2017-0-01015"},{"fundingName":"ICT R&D program of MSIP/IITP (2015-0-00300, Multiple Access Technique with Ultra-Low Latency and High Efficiency for Tactile Internet Services in IoT Environments)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Compact Full Duplex MIMO Radios in D2D Underlaid Cellular Networks: From System Design to Prototype Results","sourcePdf":"access-chae-2690904-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083445S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Recent Advances in Full-Duplex Radios and Networks"],"articleId":"7906500","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7906501,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangpeng Xie","affiliation":["School of Automation, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","Institute of Advanced Technology, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/8006322/7906501/xie-2693323-small.gif","p":["Xiangpeng Xie received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in engineering from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2004 and 2010, respectively.","From 2012 to 2014, he was a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the Department of Control Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.

First, a novel framework of the fuzzy FE observer is established with the help of a maximum-minimum-priority-based switching mechanism. Then, for every activated switching case, a targeted result is achieved by the aid of exploring an important property of improved homogenous polynomials. Since the helpful information of the underlying system can be duly updated and effectively utilized at every sampled point, the conservatism of previous results is availably reduced. Furthermore, the proposed result is further improved by eliminating those redundant terms of the introduced matrix-valued variables. Simulation results based on a discrete-time nonlinear truck-trailer model are provided to show the advantages of the theoretic result that is developed in this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906501/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"47","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2017","accessionNumber":"17081458","htmlLink":"/document/7906501/","pubMedId":"28436917","displayDocTitle":"Fault Estimation Observer Design for Discrete-Time Takagi\u2013Sugeno Fuzzy Systems Based on Homogenous Polynomially Parameter-Dependent Lyapunov Functions","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61403209 and 61533010"},{"fundingName":"Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"XNY-040"},{"fundingName":"NUPTSF Talent Project","grantNumber":"1311"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Estimation Observer Design for Discrete-Time Takagi\u2013Sugeno Fuzzy Systems Based on Homogenous Polynomially Parameter-Dependent Lyapunov Functions","sourcePdf":"tcyb-xie-2693323-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114187S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"8006322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8006322","articleId":"7906501","onlineDate":"20 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7906502,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent Jaeck","affiliation":["Institut de Saint Louis, Saint Louis, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7936705/7906502/jaeck-2696418-small.gif","p":["Vincent Jaeck received the Degree in electronics and telecommunications from the Limoges\u2019s National Superior School of Engineering, Limoges, France, in 2012, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Electronic and Telecommunications Institute of Rennes, Rennes, France, in 2016.","He joined Thales Air Systems, Rungis, France, in 2016, as an Antennas Engineer.

Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed strategies attain better performance compared with intuitive benchmark schemes. Moreover, it is revealed that the position of the legitimate monitor plays an important role on the eavesdropping performance for the two strategies.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2017.2696305","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/7901503/07906504.pdf","startPage":"917","endPage":"921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2017.2696305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7901503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proactive Eavesdropping in Relaying Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906504/","displayDocTitle":"Proactive Eavesdropping in Relaying Systems","volume":"24","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16870998","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7906504/","dateOfInsertion":"09 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671406"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"(LR15F010001)"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project of China","grantNumber":"2017ZX03001002-003"},{"fundingName":"JSPS KAKENHI","grantNumber":"17K06435"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proactive Eavesdropping in Relaying Systems","sourcePdf":"lsp-zhong-2696305-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099792S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"7901503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"7901503","articleId":"7906504","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7906505,"authors":[{"name":"Ehsan Jokar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7992992/7906505/jokar-2688859-small.gif","p":["Ehsan Jokar received the B.Sc. degree in electronic engineering from Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran, in 2010, and the M.Sc. degree in electronic engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2013.","His research activities involve cytomorphic and neuromorphic engineering including digital and analog circuit design, machine learning, and fuzzy systems."]},"firstName":"Ehsan","lastName":"Jokar","id":"37061415100"},{"name":"Hamid Soleimani","affiliation":["Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7992992/7906505/solei-2688859-small.gif","p":["Hamid Soleimani (S\u201916) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electronic engineering from Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran, in 2010 and 2012, respectively.","He is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Bio-Inspired VLSI Circuits and Systems Group, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Imperial College London, under the supervision of Prof. E.

This paper presents a novel current-input current-output circuit supporting a systematic synthesis procedure of log-domain circuits capable of computing bilateral dynamical systems with considerably low power consumption and acceptable precision. Here, the application of the method is demonstrated by synthesizing four different case studies: 1) a relatively complex 2-D nonlinear neuron model; 2) a chaotic 3-D nonlinear dynamical system Lorenz attractor having arbitrary solutions for certain parameters; 3) a 2-D nonlinear Hopf oscillator, including bistability phenomenon sensitive to initial values; and 4) three small neurosynaptic networks comprising three FHN neuron models variously coupled with excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The validity of our approach is verified by nominal and Monte Carlo simulated results with realistic process parameters from the commercially available AMS 0.35-\u03bcm technology. The resulting continuous-time, continuous-value, and low-power circuits exhibit various bifurcation phenomena, nominal time-domain responses in good agreement with their mathematical counterparts and fairly acceptable process variation results (less than 5% STD).","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2017.2688859","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2017.2688859","startPage":"2013","endPage":"2025","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7992992/07906505.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7992992","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systematic Computation of Nonlinear Bilateral Dynamical Systems With a Novel Low-Power Log-Domain Circuit","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906505/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Systematic Computation of Nonlinear Bilateral Dynamical Systems With a Novel Low-Power Log-Domain Circuit","volume":"64","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17057441","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7906505/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Hans Rausing Scholarship"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systematic Computation of Nonlinear Bilateral Dynamical Systems With a Novel Low-Power Log-Domain Circuit","sourcePdf":"tcsi-soleimani-2688859-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088662S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7992992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7992992","articleId":"7906505","onlineDate":"20 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7906509,"authors":[{"name":"Donald S.

In this paper, we address monaural speech separation in reverberant and noisy environments. We perform dereverberation and denoising using supervised learning with a deep neural network. Specifically, we enhance the magnitude and phase by performing separation with an estimate of the complex ideal ratio mask. We define the complex ideal ratio mask so that direct speech results after the mask is applied to reverberant and noisy speech. Our approach is evaluated using simulated and real room impulse responses, and with background noises. The proposed approach improves objective speech quality and intelligibility significantly. Evaluations and comparisons show that it outperforms related methods in many reverberant and noisy environments.","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2017.2696307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7938821","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2017.2696307","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/7938821/07906509.pdf","startPage":"1492","endPage":"1501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Frequency Masking in the Complex Domain for Speech Dereverberation and Denoising","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Time-Frequency Masking in the Complex Domain for Speech Dereverberation and Denoising","volume":"25","issue":"7","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7906509/","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"16932142","pubMedId":"30112422","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906509/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"Air Force Office of Scientific Research","grantNumber":"FA9550-12-1-0130"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000055","fundingName":"National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders","grantNumber":"R01 DC012048"},{"fundingName":"Ohio Supercomputer Center"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Frequency Masking in the Complex Domain for Speech Dereverberation and Denoising","sourcePdf":"taslp-williamson-2696307-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093604S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"7938821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"7938821","articleId":"7906509","onlineDate":"20 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7906512,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandra L\u2019Heureux","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Western University, London, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7906512/lheur-2696365-small.gif","p":["Alexandra L\u2019Heureux received the B.E.Sc. and M.E.Sc. degrees in software engineering from Western University, Canada, in 2013 and 2015, respectively, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

The realization of this grand potential relies on the ability to extract value from such massive data through data analytics; machine learning is at its core because of its ability to learn from data and provide data driven insights, decisions, and predictions. However, traditional machine learning approaches were developed in a different era, and thus are based upon multiple assumptions, such as the data set fitting entirely into memory, what unfortunately no longer holds true in this new context. These broken assumptions, together with the Big Data characteristics, are creating obstacles for the traditional techniques. Consequently, this paper compiles, summarizes, and organizes machine learning challenges with Big Data. In contrast to other research that discusses challenges, this work highlights the cause-effect relationship by organizing challenges according to Big Data Vs or dimensions that instigated the issue: volume, velocity, variety, or veracity. Moreover, emerging machine learning approaches and techniques are discussed in terms of how they are capable of handling the various challenges with the ultimate objective of helping practitioners select appropriate solutions for their use cases. Finally, a matrix relating the challenges and approaches is presented. Through this process, this paper provides a perspective on the domain, identifies research gaps and opportunities, and provides a strong foundation and encouragement for further research in the field of machine learning with Big Data.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2696365","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2696365","startPage":"7776","endPage":"7797","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07906512.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Machine Learning With Big Data: Challenges and Approaches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906512/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Machine Learning With Big Data: Challenges and Approaches","volume":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","accessionNumber":"16904604","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","htmlLink":"/document/7906512/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"NSERC CRD at Western University","grantNumber":"477530-14"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Machine Learning With Big Data: Challenges and Approaches","sourcePdf":"access-grolinger-2696365-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.193967S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"256","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7906512","onlineDate":"20 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-27"},{"_id":7906514,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Xu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8031005/7906514/xu-2696461-small.gif","p":["Chen Xu (M'17) was born in Hubei, China, in 1988.

So it is difficult for shunt active power filter (SAPF) to damp parallel resonance. This paper investigates parallel resonance detection with square-wave current active injection and selective compensation control with closed-loop regulation of point of common coupling (PCC) voltage for SAPF. The principles of parallel resonance and its frequency detection are analyzed by means of equivalent circuit. Through injecting given square-wave current lasting for 0.5 s, SAPF could fast detect parallel resonance with the help of spectrum analysis of resonance power index. In order to improve power quality of both PCC voltage and grid current, SAPF is controlled to suppress specified harmonic currents from nonlinear load and selectively damp parallel resonance at the same time. In addition, ordinary proportional-integral plus advanced repetitive controller in parallel is used to improve current tracking performance. Experiment test results are provided to verify the validity of proposed detection and control methods.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2017.2696461","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2017.2696461","startPage":"8066","endPage":"8078","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8031005/07906514.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8031005","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel Resonance Detection and Selective Compensation Control for SAPF With Square-Wave Current Active Injection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Parallel Resonance Detection and Selective Compensation Control for SAPF With Square-Wave Current Active Injection","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2017","volume":"64","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7906514/","accessionNumber":"17169513","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906514/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"NSFC 51277086 and NSFC 51577078"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Resonance Detection and Selective Compensation Control for SAPF With Square-Wave Current Active Injection","sourcePdf":"tie-chen-2696461-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.228585S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8031005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8031005","articleId":"7906514","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7906516,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Qin","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8031005/7906516/qin-2696462-small.gif","p":["Wei Qin (S\u201914) was born in Jiangsu, China, in 1991.

Applying these codes in SSD-based systems incurs additional number of Program/Erase (P/E) cycles on each disk, which may accelerate the wear-out of disks. This means that while erasure codes improve reliability of SSD-based systems, they impose a side-effect that may degrade reliability as the number of P/E cycles increases. This paper investigates the benefit and side-effect of erasure codes on reliability of SSD-based systems. The investigation attempts to find out the parameters which improve/damage reliability. This study has been evaluated using the DiskSim and SOYA simulators, and exploiting different configurations for a storage system running nine real workloads. In the simulation, the effect of five parameters on the improvement/damage of reliability is studied; these parameters are mapping P/E cycles with failure rate, disk failure rate, disk repair time, number of disks, and coding pattern of erasure codes. Simulation results show that in almost all cases, the effect of erasure codes on reliability improvement is on average 16 percent greater than their effect on reliability degradation.","doi":"10.1109/TETC.2017.2693424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8824015","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TETC.2017.2693424","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245516/8824015/07906530.pdf","startPage":"435","endPage":"446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Can Erasure Codes Damage Reliability in SSD-Based Storage Systems?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Can Erasure Codes Damage Reliability in SSD-Based Storage Systems?","volume":"7","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept. 1 2019","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7906530/","publicationDate":"1 July-Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"18954545","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906530/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Can Erasure Codes Damage Reliability in SSD-Based Storage Systems?","sourcePdf":"tetc-alinezhadchamazcoti-2693424-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120185S","chronDate":"July-Sept. 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"6245516","isNumber":"8824015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245516","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8824015","articleId":"7906530","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7906531,"authors":[{"name":"Yicheng Sun","affiliation":["NRIEE, Nanjing, China","School of Electronic and Optical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yicheng","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085582093"},{"name":"Guohua Gu","affiliation":["NRIEE, Nanjing, China","School of Electronic and Optical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Guohua","lastName":"Gu","id":"37085571062"},{"name":"Xiubao Sui","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Optical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiubao","lastName":"Sui","id":"37845306400"},{"name":"Yuqi Li","affiliation":["NRIEE, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yuqi","lastName":"Li","id":"37086026521"},{"name":"Shuangshuang Xu","affiliation":["CEC Panda LCD Technology Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shuangshuang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085668679"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0655"},{"format":"CD","value":"1943-0647"}],"articleNumber":"7906531","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":596},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"Phase value of each zone of the BPAF.","type":"graphic","fileSize":"104 KB","file":"/ielx7/4563994/7906113/7906531/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2696519.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/4563994/7906113/7906531/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2696519.jpg"},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical filters","Optical imaging","Optical sensors","Spatial resolution","Adaptive optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","image filtering","image resolution","optical filters","spatial light modulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pure-phase spatial light modulator","4F optical system","diffraction-limited optical system","binary pure-phase annular filter","compressive sensing","super-resolution imaging"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Superresolution","optical system","phase-only filters"]}],"abstract":"Super-resolution is an important goal for the diffraction-limited optical system.

Both analytical and simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the use of the NOMA assisted multicast-unicast scheme yields a significant improvement in spectral efficiency compared with orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes which realize multicasting and unicasting services separately. Since unicast messages are broadcast to all the users, how the use of NOMA can prevent those multicast receivers intercepting the unicasting messages is also investigated, where it is shown that the secrecy unicasting rate achieved by NOMA is always larger than or equal to that of OMA.

However, it is unclear whether content pushing can improve the energy efficiency of delay-constrained wireless communication systems over fading channels. With pushing, the energy consumption can be reduced due to the extended transmission time duration. But if the user never needs the pushed content, pushing may lead to wasted energy. Based on the random content request delay, this paper derives the user request probability thresholds that determine whether a content file should be pushed under two different quality-of-service requirements, namely, average delay and delay-outage constraints. Moreover, optimal strategies to allocate transmission power in content pushing and on-demand delivery stages are also proposed. It is shown that the energy efficiency of systems with pushing can be significantly improved as the content request probability increases. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed power allocation strategies for different delay constraints, compared with the corresponding on-demand schemes.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6287639/7859429/7906544-aam.pdf","topic":"Wireless Cachiing Technique for 5G","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906544/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2017","accessionNumber":"17124290","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7906544/","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficient Wireless Pushing With Request Delay Information and Delivery Delay Constraint","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000144","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1420575"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1456793"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671269 and 61621091"},{"fundingName":"National 973 Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB336600"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Energy Efficient Wireless Pushing With Request Delay Information and Delivery Delay Constraint","sourcePdf":"access-chen-2696024-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131988S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Wireless Cachiing Technique for 5G"],"articleId":"7906544","onlineDate":"20 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7906545,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph Lemley","affiliation":["Collage of Engineering and Informatics, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7906545/lemle-2696121-small.gif","p":["Joseph Lemley (S\u201917) received the B.S. degree in computer science and the master\u2019s degree in computational science from Central Washington University in 2006 and 2016, respectively.

There are many techniques to address this, including data augmentation, dropout, and transfer learning. In this paper, we introduce an additional method, which we call smart augmentation and we show how to use it to increase the accuracy and reduce over fitting on a target network. Smart augmentation works, by creating a network that learns how to generate augmented data during the training process of a target network in a way that reduces that networks loss. This allows us to learn augmentations that minimize the error of that network. Smart augmentation has shown the potential to increase accuracy by demonstrably significant measures on all data sets tested. In addition, it has shown potential to achieve similar or improved performance levels with significantly smaller network sizes in a number of tested cases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906545/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"16870796","htmlLink":"/document/7906545/","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Smart Augmentation Learning an Optimal Data Augmentation Strategy","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001602","fundingName":"SFI Strategic Partnership Program on Next Generation Imaging for Smartphone and Embedded Platforms by Science Foundation Ireland and FotoNation Ltd","grantNumber":"13/SPP/I2868"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002081","fundingName":"Irish Research Council Employment Based Programme Award","grantNumber":"EBPPG/2016/280"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Smart Augmentation Learning an Optimal Data Augmentation Strategy","sourcePdf":"access-lemley-2696121-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054731S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"133","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7906545","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7906552,"authors":[{"name":"Shan Yin","affiliation":["Rolls-Royce@NTU Corporate Lab, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore","Microsystem and Terahertz Research Center, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8062949/7906552/yin-2696490-small.gif","p":["Shan Yin (S\u201912\u2013M\u201916) received the B.Eng. degree in\n microelectronics from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2010, and the\n Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, in 2016.","In 2013, he was a Research Student and then a Research Fellow with the Rolls-Royce@NTU Corporate Lab, NTU.

In single-level cell (SLC) flash memory, ICI arises when 1 0 1 patterns are programmed either in the horizontal or vertical directions. Since data pages are written sequentially in horizontal wordlines, one can mitigate the effects of horizontal ICI by applying conventional constrained codes that forbid the 1 0 1 pattern. This approach does not address the problem of vertical ICI, however. In this paper, a row-by-row coding technique that eliminates vertical 1 0 1 patterns while preserving the sequential wordline programming order is presented. This scheme, though efficient, necessarily suffers a rate loss of almost 20%. We therefore propose another coding scheme, combining a weak constraint on vertical 1 0 1 patterns with a systematic error-correcting code, that can mitigate vertical ICI errors while achieving a higher overall coding rate, provided that the vertical ICI error probability is sufficiently small. Some extensions for multi-level cell (MLC) flash memory are discussed as well.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2696530","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8068314/07906562.pdf","startPage":"4101","endPage":"4113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8068314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2696530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Row-by-Row Coding Schemes for Inter-Cell Interference in Flash Memory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906562","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/26/8068314/7906562-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Row-by-Row Coding Schemes for Inter-Cell Interference in Flash Memory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906562/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17243589","htmlLink":"/document/7906562/","volume":"65","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-1405119 and CCF-1619053"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007255","fundingName":"ISEF Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001735","fundingName":"Weizmann Institute of Science-National Postdoctoral Award Program for Advancing Women in Science"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Row-by-Row Coding Schemes for Inter-Cell Interference in Flash Memory","sourcePdf":"tcomm-buzaglo-2696530-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158068S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8068314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8068314","articleId":"7906562","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7906567,"authors":[{"name":"Aapo Aapro","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8006337/7906567/aapro-2696494-small.gif","p":["Aapo Aapro (S\u201915) received the M.Sc.

LCL -filter creates resonances in the converter dynamics which shall be damped for ensuring robust performance of the converter. Active damping methods can be used to attenuate the resonant behavior effectively. Accordingly, the output impedance is affected and the grid-interaction sensitivity of the converter varies with the active damping design. In order to carry out impedance-based stability analysis or assessment of the harmonic rejection capability, an accurate analytical model to predict the output impedance is necessary. This paper investigates the output impedance properties of capacitor-current-feedback active damping, which are so far not considered thoroughly in the literature. The output impedance modification with the active damping design is explained, thus, the stability and harmonic rejection capability of the converter can be improved. Furthermore, in order to validate the model, experimental measurements of the output impedance with active damping are presented for the first time in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2017.2696494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2017.2696494","startPage":"7532","endPage":"7541","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8006337/07906567.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8006337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of Active Damping on Output Impedance of Three-Phase Grid-Connected Converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Active Damping on Output Impedance of Three-Phase Grid-Connected Converter","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2017","volume":"64","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7906567/","accessionNumber":"17136007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906567/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Active Damping on Output Impedance of Three-Phase Grid-Connected Converter","sourcePdf":"tie-aapro-2696494-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079212S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8006337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"8006337","articleId":"7906567","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7906572,"authors":[{"name":"Tanmay Kulkarni","affiliation":["Bioelectronics Laboratory, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7932554/7906572/kulka-2696260-small.gif","p":["Tanmay Kulkarni (S\u201915) received the bachelor\u2019s degree from the K.

Compared with classical TFA methods, the proposed method can generate a more energy concentrated TF representation and allow for signal reconstruction. The proposed SET method is inspired by the recently proposed synchrosqueezing transform (SST) and the theory of the ideal TFA. To analyze a signal, it is important to obtain the time-varying information, such as the IF and instantaneous amplitude. The SST is to squeeze all TF coefficients into the IF trajectory. Differ from the squeezing manner of SST, the main idea of SET is to only retain the TF information of STFT results most related to time-varying features of the signal and to remove most smeared TF energy, such that the energy concentration of the novel TF representation can be enhanced greatly.

The sensor is designed using the full-wave electromagnetic solver and its equivalent circuit model is obtained. A numerical model of the proposed sensor is developed for extracting the magnetic and the dielectric properties of the sample under test in terms of change in resonance frequency after loading the device with the test specimen.

In the considered system, the users who have data to transmit in the uplink only can be empowered by the WPT in the downlink from a base station (BS) with large scale multiple antennas. The problem of optimizing the energy efficiency of the considered system is formulated with consideration of beamforming design, antenna selection, power allocation, and time division protocol based on the practical consideration, i.e., imperfect channel state information at the BS. In particular, the proposed antenna selection scheme is intended to find the optimal number of antennas and then employ the energy beamforming. Moreover, In order to find the optimal power and time allocation, a scheme based on nonlinear fractional programming is utilized. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes and their superior performance over other existing schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

The PI is tunable to allow 7-bit calibration of 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 LO phases. A systematic 2-D calibration scheme that is applicable to both the receiver and transmitter is described.

Its philosophy is to map coded bits directly to multidimensional sparse codewords, and the message passing algorithm (MPA) is utilized to detect the multiuser signals. However, the relatively high computation of MPA detection may lower the performance when SCMA is implemented in practical applications. The partial marginalization MPA (PM-MPA) helps to reduce the computation of original MPA detection. In this paper, an improved detection scheme based on PM-MPA is proposed. Our analysis and simulation shows that compared with PM-MPA, the improved PM-MPA (IPM-MPA) can obtain a lower bit error ratio. Besides, the simulation also shows that, to achieve the same performance, the IPM-MPA is less complex than PM-MPA.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8534511/07906597.pdf","startPage":"3289","endPage":"3297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low Complexity Detection Algorithm for Fixed Up-Link SCMA System in Mission Critical Scenario","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2017.2696028","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8534511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2017.2696028","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906597","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906597/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","displayDocTitle":"A Low Complexity Detection Algorithm for Fixed Up-Link SCMA System in Mission Critical Scenario","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2018","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18582224","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7906597/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671183 and 91438205"},{"fundingName":"Major Consulting Projects of Chinese Academy of Engineering","grantNumber":"2016-ZD-05-07"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Space-Ground Integrated Information Technology","grantNumber":"2015_SGIIT_KFJJ_TX_02"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low Complexity Detection Algorithm for Fixed Up-Link SCMA System in Mission Critical Scenario","sourcePdf":"jiot-jia-2696028-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.19059S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8534511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8534511","articleId":"7906597","onlineDate":"20 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7906602,"authors":[{"name":"Runchun Wang","affiliation":["The MARCS Institute for Brain, Behaviour, and Development, Western Sydney University, Penrith, N.S.W., Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/7933280/7906602/wang-2666883-small.gif","p":["Runchun Wang (M\u201913) received the M.Sc. degree in electrical\n engineering from the Shanghai Jiatong University, Shanghai, China, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree in neuromorphic\n engineering from Western Sydney University, Sydney, Australia, in 2013.

NEF is a framework that is capable of synthesising large-scale cognitive systems from subnetworks and we have previously presented an FPGA implementation of the NEF that successfully performs nonlinear mathematical computations. That work was developed based on a compact digital neural core, which consists of 64 neurons that are instantiated by a single physical neuron using a time-multiplexing approach. We have now scaled this approach up to build a pattern recognition system by combining identical neural cores together. As a proof of concept, we have developed a handwritten digit recognition system using the MNIST database and achieved a recognition rate of 96.55%. The system is implemented on a state-of-the-art FPGA and can process 5.12 million digits per second. The architecture and hardware optimisations presented offer high-speed and resource-efficient means for performing high-speed, neuromorphic, and massively parallel pattern recognition and classification tasks.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/4156126/7933280/07906602.pdf","startPage":"574","endPage":"584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neuromorphic Hardware Architecture Using the Neural Engineering Framework for Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2017.2666883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7933280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2017.2666883","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906602","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906602/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 May 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","displayDocTitle":"Neuromorphic Hardware Architecture Using the Neural Engineering Framework for Pattern Recognition","dateOfInsertion":"24 May 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16898977","pubMedId":"28436888","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"11","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7906602/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP140103001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neuromorphic Hardware Architecture Using the Neural Engineering Framework for Pattern Recognition","sourcePdf":"tbcas-thakur-2666883-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098549S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"7933280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7933280","articleId":"7906602","onlineDate":"23 May 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7906603,"authors":[{"name":"Qing-Hua Tang","affiliation":["School of Optical and Electronic Information, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Qing-Hua","lastName":"Tang","id":"37086117069"},{"name":"Yang-Hua Li","affiliation":["School of Optical and Electronic Information, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yang-Hua","lastName":"Li","id":"37086118397"},{"name":"Wen-Guang Li","affiliation":["School of Optical and Electronic Information, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Wen-Guang","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0002-1600-7640","id":"37597581300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"7906603","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":667},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906603","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Impedance","Bandwidth","Broadband communication","Frequency conversion","Wireless communication","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UHF power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["second octave power amplifier design","resistive-resistive series","continuous class-F/F-1 modes","resistive second-harmonic impedance","resistive third-harmonic impedances","reactive third-harmonic impedance","waveform engineering method","frequency 0.4 GHz to 2.3 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadband","power amplifier (PA)","series of continuous modes (SCMs)"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents a novel methodology for resistive-resistive series of continuous class-F/F\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup>\n modes (Res.-Res.

Two types of distributed observer algorithms are proposed to solve the consensus problem by utilizing continuous and intermittent position measurements, respectively, where each observer does not interact with any other observers. For the case of continuous communication between network agents, some convergence conditions are derived for reaching consensus in the network with a single constant delay or multiple time-varying delays on the basis of the eigenvalue analysis and the descriptor method. When the network agents can only obtain intermittent position data from local neighbors at discrete time instants, the consensus in the network without time delay or with nonuniform delays is investigated by using the Wirtinger's inequality and the delayed-input approach. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the theoretical analysis.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multi-agent systems","Delays","Protocols","Delay effects","Observers","Position measurement","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","multi-agent systems","time-varying systems","topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed position-based consensus","second-order multiagent systems","double-integrator dynamics","directed topology","distributed observer algorithms","single constant delay","time-varying delays","discrete time instants","eigenvalue analysis","descriptor method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Continuous/intermittent position measurement","multiagent system","reduced-order observer","second-order consensus","time delay"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7959588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2017.2691714","startPage":"1860","endPage":"1871","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/7959588/07906607.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2017.2691714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Position-Based Consensus of Second-Order Multiagent Systems With Continuous/Intermittent Communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 April 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Distributed Position-Based Consensus of Second-Order Multiagent Systems With Continuous/Intermittent Communication","accessionNumber":"17040621","pubMedId":"28436912","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","volume":"47","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7906607/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906607/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61273218, 61304172, 61272530, 61573096, 61673104 and 61673078"},{"fundingName":"\u201c333 Engineering\u201d Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China","grantNumber":"BRA2015286"},{"fundingName":"Scientific Research Fund of Henan Provincial Education Department","grantNumber":"16A413004"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China","grantNumber":"2242016K41030"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006407","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province of China","grantNumber":"16309, 162102310261 and 172102210212"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003489","fundingName":"Research Foundation for Advanced Talents of Henan University of Technology","grantNumber":"31401548"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003489","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Henan Provincial Colleges and Universities in Henan University of Technology","grantNumber":"2016RCJH01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Position-Based Consensus of Second-Order Multiagent Systems With Continuous/Intermittent Communication","sourcePdf":"tcyb-cao-2691714-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109208S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7959588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7959588","articleId":"7906607","onlineDate":"20 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7906615,"authors":[{"name":"Lixia Xiao","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Sichuan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8067706/7906615/lxiao-2696380-small.gif","p":["Lixia Xiao received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in 2010 and 2013,\n respectively, from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, where she is currently\n working toward the Ph.D. degree with the National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications.

It employs the hybrid concept of differential spatial modulation (DSM) and space-time block coding (STBC) to exploit the diversity benefits of STBC without the channel state information (CSI). In the STBC-DSM scheme, information bits are conveyed via the antenna matrix (AM) indices, as well as STBC blocks. Specifically, a novel AM set is first designed such that the transmitter requires only sparse (one or two) frequency radio (RF) chains. Then, the proposed STBC-DSM scheme is extended to the large-scale MIMO scenarios, and a low-complexity near-optimal detection algorithm is developed. Finally, an upper bound for the average bit error probability of the proposed scheme is derived. Both analytical and simulation results have shown that the proposed scheme is capable of achieving considerable performance gains over the existing DSM and differential Alamouti schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2696380","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8067706/07906615.pdf","startPage":"8821","endPage":"8834","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8067706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2696380","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-Time Block Coded Differential Spatial Modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906615","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Space-Time Block Coded Differential Spatial Modulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906615/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17243512","htmlLink":"/document/7906615/","volume":"66","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501095 and 61471090"},{"fundingName":"National High-Tech R and D Program of China (\u201c863\u201d Project)","grantNumber":"2015AA01A709"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"ZYGX2015J011"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-Time Block Coded Differential Spatial Modulation","sourcePdf":"tvt-xiao-2696380-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.224211S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8067706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8067706","articleId":"7906615","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7906623,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37085421076"},{"name":"Shangjie Feng","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Shangjie","lastName":"Feng","id":"37085884161"},{"name":"Xiaohu Ge","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohu","lastName":"Ge","id":"37287703200"},{"name":"Guoqiang Mao","affiliation":["University of Technology Sydney and National ICT Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Guoqiang","lastName":"Mao","id":"37298234600"},{"name":"Lajos Hanzo","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"firstName":"Lajos","lastName":"Hanzo","orcid":"0000-0002-2636-5214","id":"37276255400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"7906623","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":767},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906623","abstract":"In this paper, we consider a two-hop full-duplex multi-relay channel (FD-MRC) for exploiting the high spectral efficiency of FD systems and the diversity gains of multi-relay systems. Employing a decode-andforward (DF) relaying protocol, the single best relay is selected from those relays that have successfully decoded the source message, which then helps forward the source message to the destination. Meanwhile, a new message is broadcast by the source, and all the N relays, including the selected best one, attempt to decode this new message. In view of the effect of both inter-relay interference and self-interference, a one-step correlation exists between the relay decoding results in successive time slots. Then, a Markov chain-based analytical model is utilized for analyzing the exact outage probability of FD-MRC. Furthermore, a close-to-full diversity order of (N - 1 + \u03bc) is analytically proved to be attainable for FD-MRC, where \u03bc is a factor characterizing the efficiency of SI mitigation.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2696512","startPage":"9550","endPage":"9554","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8067706/07906623.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2696512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8067706","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Performance of Full-Duplex Multi-Relay Channels With DF Relays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Interference","Decoding","Rough surfaces","Diversity methods","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decode and forward communication","decoding","diversity reception","Markov processes","probability","protocols","radiofrequency interference","relay networks (telecommunication)","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["source message","N relays","self-interference","FD-MRC","DF relays","FD systems","multirelay systems","relaying protocol","interrelay interference","diversity gains","two-hop full-duplex multirelay channel","decode-and-forward relaying protocol","one-step correlation","Markov chain-based analytical model","exact outage probability","close-to-full diversity order","SI mitigation efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Diversity","full-duplex, relays","interference","outage probability","relay selection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906623/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","displayDocTitle":"On the Performance of Full-Duplex Multi-Relay Channels With DF Relays","volume":"66","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7906623/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17243569","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61461136004"},{"fundingName":"NFSC Major International Joint Research Project","grantNumber":"61210002"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002767","fundingName":"Hubei Provincial Science and Technology Department","grantNumber":"2016AHB006"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds"},{"fundingName":"Central Universities","grantNumber":"2015XJGH011"},{"fundingName":"China International Joint Research Center of Green Communications and Networking","grantNumber":"2015B01008"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Performance of Full-Duplex Multi-Relay Channels With DF Relays","sourcePdf":"tvt-hanzo-2696512-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075843S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8067706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8067706","articleId":"7906623","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7906630,"authors":[{"name":"Devendra Singh Gurjar","affiliation":["Discipline of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Indore, Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8067706/7906630/gurja-2696047-small.gif","p":["Devendra Singh Gurjar (S\u201913) received the B.Tech. degree in\n electronics and communications engineering from the Uttar Pradesh Technical University, Lucknow, India, in 2011 and\n the M.Tech. degree in wireless communications and computing from the Indian Institute of Information Technology\n Allahabad, Allahabad, India, in 2013.

Herein, we employ transmit/receive beamforming at source nodes and analog network coding (ANC) at the relay node in the presence of CSI imperfections due to channel estimation errors (CEE) and feedback delay. With such a practical setup, we first deduce the pertinent instantaneous end-to-end signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) after performing partial self-interference cancellation. Then, by imposing asymmetric traffic requirements in two opposite directions, we conduct an accurate analysis of overall outage probability (OOP) of the considered system. We further derive a tight lower bound on OOP that has a simple and compact closed-form representation. Moreover, based on the asymptotic OOP expression at high SNR, we examine the achievable diversity order of the system. In addition, we acquire an upper bound expression of ergodic sum-rate (ESR) and simplify it further in useful compact form for high SNR regime. Besides, we investigate the optimization problems of relay position to minimize the OOP and to maximize the ESR. Numerical and simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and highlight the impact of CEE and feedback delay under various traffic patterns on the overall system performance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2696047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8067706","startPage":"8807","endPage":"8820","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8067706/07906630.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamforming in Traffic-Aware Two-Way Relay Systems With Channel Estimation Error and Feedback Delay","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906630/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7906630/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Beamforming in Traffic-Aware Two-Way Relay Systems With Channel Estimation Error and Feedback Delay","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17243510","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"66","issue":"10","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001843","fundingName":"Science and Engineering Research Board"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006143","fundingName":"Department of Science and Technology"},{"fundingName":"Government of India","grantNumber":"SERC/ETA-0325/2012"},{"fundingName":"Brazilian Ministry of Planning, Development, and Management","grantNumber":"DIPLA 005/2016 and SEST 11/2016"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002322","fundingName":"CAPES","grantNumber":"FORTE 23038.007604/2014-69"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming in Traffic-Aware Two-Way Relay Systems With Channel Estimation Error and Feedback Delay","sourcePdf":"tvt-upadhyay-2696047-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104087S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8067706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8067706","articleId":"7906630","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7906642,"authors":[{"name":"Lara Codeca","affiliation":["Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5117645/7904753/7906642/7906642-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lara Codec\u00e1 is Ph.D. student at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT) of the University of Luxembourg (UL).

Among the multiple challenges arising from technology nodes lower than 20nm, we can mention high leakage current (i.e., high static power consumption), reduced performance gain, reduced reliability, complex manufacturing processes leading to low yield and complex testing procedures, and extremely costly masks. In other words, ICs manufactured with the latest technology nodes are less and less efficient (w.r.t. both performance and energy consumption) than forecasted by the Moore's law. Moreover, manufactured devices are becoming less and less reliable, meaning that errors can appear during the normal lifetime of a device with a higher probability than with previous technology nodes. Fault tolerant mechanisms are therefore required to ensure the correct behavior of such devices at the cost of extra area, power and timing overheads. Finally, process variations force engineers to add extra guard bands (e.g., higher supply voltage or lower clock frequency than required under normal circumstances) to guarantee the correct functioning of manufactured devices. In the recent years, the Approximate Computing (AC) paradigm has emerged. AC is based on the intuitive observation that, while performing exact computation requires a high amount of resources, allowing selective approximation or occasional violation of the specification can provide gains in efficiency (i.e., less power consumption, less area, higher manufacturing yield) without significantly affecting the output quality [1]. This invited talk will first discuss the basic concepts of the AC paradigm and then will focus on the Design & Test of Integrated Circuits for AC-based systems. From the design point of view, a methodology able to automatically explore the impact of different approximation techniques on a given input algorithm will be presented. The methodology does not need to specify which part(s) of the algorithm should be approximated and how. It only requires the definition of the acceptable output degradation from the user. Aiming at defining a general method for considering arbitrary approximate computing techniques, IDEA has been developed, which is a design exploration tool able to find approximate versions for an algorithm described in software (i.e., coded in C/C++), by mutating the original code [2]. The mutated (i.e., approximated) version of the algorithm is then synthetized by using a High-Level Synthesis tool to obtain a HDL code. The latter is finally mapped into an FPGA to estimate the benefits of the approximation in terms of area reduction and performances. IDEA is composed of two main components: (i) a source-to-source compiler, the Clang-Chimera, which analyzes the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to apply user-defined code mutators, and (ii) a Branch & Bound optimizer, in order to search for the best functional approximation version of the given C/C++ code. Regarding the test of integrated circuits, we start from the consideration that AC-based systems can intrinsically accept the presence of faulty hardware (i.e., hardware that can produce errors). This paradigm is also called \u201ccomputing on unreliable hardware\u201d. The hardware-induced errors have to be analyzed to determine their propagation through the system layers and eventually determining their impact on the final application. In other words, an AC-based system does not need to be built using defect-free ICs. Indeed, AC-based systems can manage at higher-level the errors due to defectives ICs, or those errors simply do not significantly impact the final applications. Under this assumption, we can relax test and reliability constraints of the manufactured ICs [3]. One of the ways to achieve this goal is to test only for a subset of faults instead of targeting all possible faults. In this way, we can reduce the manufacturing cost since we eventually reduce the number of test patterns and thus the test time.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7906734","publicationTitle":"2017 18th IEEE Latin American Test Symposium (LATS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 18th IEEE Latin American Test Symposium (LATS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7899159/7906734/07906737.pdf","doi":"10.1109/LATW.2017.7906737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LATW.2017.7906737","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximate computing: Design & test for integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 March 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906737/","displayDocTitle":"Approximate computing: Design & test for integrated circuits","htmlLink":"/document/7906737/","conferenceDate":"13-15 March 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate computing: Design & test for integrated circuits","confLoc":"Bogota, Colombia","sourcePdf":"LATS2017IP3hf.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054059S","chronDate":"13-15 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7899159","isNumber":"7906734","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7899159","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7906734","articleId":"7906737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7906747,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Benevenuti","affiliation":["Graduate Program in Microelectronics (PGMICRO), Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Brazil"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Benevenuti","id":"37086015856"},{"name":"Fernanda Lima Kastensmidt","affiliation":["Graduate Program in Microelectronics (PGMICRO), Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Brazil"],"firstName":"Fernanda Lima","lastName":"Kastensmidt","id":"37294370400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0415-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0416-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7906747","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":284},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Circuit faults","Cryptography","Fault detection","Sensors","Redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","fault diagnosis","fault tolerant computing","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit layout","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault attack detection evaluation","SRAM-based FPGA","extended fault injection","attack detection capability","countermeasure effectiveness","security sensitive design modules","functional module redundancy","FPGA floorplan","fault detection mesh","configuration memory","laser attack","Xilinx 7 Series device","substitution box","S-box","Rijndael symmetric cryptography","AES","Advanced Encryption Standard"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Programmable circuits","fault injection","security"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906747","abstract":"In this paper we present an extended fault injection approach to configuration memory of SRAM-based FPGAs consisting of inter frame many bits upsets to be used as an evaluation tool for attack detection capability and countermeasure effectiveness in security sensitive design modules.

Moreover, ANNs can also be used to accelerate parts out of an algorithm which the data can be approximated using NPUs (Neural Processing Units). FPGAs are intrinsically parallel making these devices a good choice to implement an ANN. However, SRAM-based FPGAs are very susceptible to neutron-induced soft errors. Consequently, an ANN running in SRAM-based FPGAs devices must be characterized under soft errors. This work shows the soft error effects of a feedforward ANN under fault injection emulation performed in the bitstream of the FPGA. The number of critical bits able to provoke errors and failures in the output of the network are analyzed.

Radiation-hardened (rad-hard) electronics used in this domain is regulated under severe and complex political and commercial treaties. In order to refrain from these undesired political and commercial barriers COTS FPGAs (despite the fact of their low reliability) have been considered as a promising alternative to replace rad-hard ICs. Moreover, SRAM-based FPGAs are pretermitted with respect to flash or anti-fuse devices. In this scenario, this paper analyses, by means of heavy-ion accelerator experiments, the Single-Event Upset (SEU) tolerance of the Microsemi ProAsic3E A3PE1500 COTS FPGA.

These experimental results allow us to consider this component as a strong candidate to replace rad-hard FPGAs, if its use is combined with strict system-level fault-tolerant strategies for error detection and correction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906772/","conferenceDate":"13-15 March 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 March 2017","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16837107","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7906772/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of single-event upsets in a Microsemi ProAsic3E FPGA","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of single-event upsets in a Microsemi ProAsic3E FPGA","confLoc":"Bogota, Colombia","sourcePdf":"LATS2017RS93hf.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072196S","chronDate":"13-15 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7899159","isNumber":"7906734","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7899159","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7906734","articleId":"7906772","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7906790,"authors":[{"name":"Ankit Agarwal","affiliation":["Electronics & Communication Engineering Department, Agra College, Agra, India"],"firstName":"Ankit","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37086113971"},{"name":"Nisha Verma","affiliation":["Electronics & Communication Engineering Department, Agra College, Agra, India"],"firstName":"Nisha","lastName":"Verma","id":"37086116495"},{"name":"Himani Tiwari","affiliation":["Electronics & Communication Engineering Department, Agra College, Agra, India"],"firstName":"Himani","lastName":"Tiwari","id":"37086116910"},{"name":"Juhi Singh","affiliation":["Electronics & Communication Engineering Department, Agra College, Agra, India"],"firstName":"Juhi","lastName":"Singh","id":"37086110602"},{"name":"Varun Maheshwari","affiliation":["Electronics & Communication Engineering Department, Agra College, Agra, India"],"firstName":"Varun","lastName":"Maheshwari","id":"37085500114"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4177-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4178-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7906790","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":360},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and development of phasor measurement unit on FPGA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906790","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Phasor measurement units","Voltage measurement","Reactive power","Global Positioning System","Power measurement","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer interfaces","data communication equipment","field programmable gate arrays","Global Positioning System","phasor measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter interface","UART interface","GPS","Global Positioning System","GPRMC","recommended minimum specific Global Navigation Satellite System","GENESYS XILINX VIRTEX 5 XC5VLX50T FPGA board","field programmable gate array","pipelined architecture","microcontroller","microprocessor","electrical quantity measurement","wide area monitoring","coordinated measurement technology","PMU","data logging","central control station","power system control","power system monitoring","power system protection","power measurement","current measurement","voltage measurement","electrical distribution system","electrical transmission system","phasor measurement unit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Communication Module","Concurrent architecture","Field Programmable Gate Arrays","Global Positioning System","Phasor Measurement Unit"]}],"abstract":"In any electrical transmission and distribution system, measurement of voltage, current and different power are necessarily for smooth functioning of a power system. The magnitude and phasor of these quantities are used in implementing different relays for power system protection, monitoring, control, communicating data to central control station, data logging and self-diagnosis. Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) is a coordinated measurement technology which provides wide area monitoring, protection and controlling of system. Since electric distribution networks are widely extended, control systems can carry out measurements of electrical quantities simultaneously. A sequential implementation of PMU based on microprocessor/microcontroller increases the time taken in computing the results and it affects the efficiency of the controlling system. In this paper the pipelined architecture based PMU is implemented on Field Programmable Gate Arrays, which senses-processes-communicates at the same time. The PMU is implemented on GENESYS XILINX VIRTEX 5 XC5VLX50T FPGA board with communication facility. Recommended Minimum Specific Global Navigation Satellite System (GPRMC) header is obtained by connecting Global Positioning System (GPS) to the PMU. Results are displayed on hyper terminal with help of Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter (UART) interface.","doi":"10.1109/R10-HTC.2016.7906790","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/R10-HTC.2016.7906790","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Region 10 Humanitarian Technology Conference (R10-HTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Region 10 Humanitarian Technology Conference (R10-HTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7898714/7906774/07906790.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7906774","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906790/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Design and development of phasor measurement unit on FPGA","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16837084","htmlLink":"/document/7906790/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and development of phasor measurement unit on FPGA","confLoc":"Agra, India","sourcePdf":"IEEEHTC2016ELC138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080509S","chronDate":"21-23 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7898714","isNumber":"7906774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7898714","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7906774","articleId":"7906790","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7906792,"authors":[{"name":"Pushkar Singh","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication, JSS Acadmey of Technical Education, Noida, India"],"firstName":"Pushkar","lastName":"Singh","id":"37086036259"},{"name":"Sanghamitra Saikia","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Tezpur University, Tezpur, India"],"firstName":"Sanghamitra","lastName":"Saikia","id":"37086032106"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4177-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4178-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7906792","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4377},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Irrigation","Temperature sensors","Prototypes","Temperature measurement","Control systems","Soil moisture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised instrumentation","crops","environmental factors","flow measurement","flow sensors","intelligent sensors","irrigation","moisture measurement","public domain software","pumps","soil","temperature measurement","temperature sensors","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arduino-based smart irrigation","water flow sensor","soil moisture sensor","temperature sensor","ESP8266 WiFi module","Controlled Environment Agriculture","CEA","computer controlled water irrigation system","lightning","ventilation","farming","arduino based controlled irrigation system","environmental factor","interactive website","pump","sprinkler","quality crop"]}],"abstract":"Emergence of Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) ranging from computer controlled water irrigation system to lightning and ventilation has changed the conventional scenario of farming.

In such case, power consumption and network bandwidth become a major concern. We need a low power device that transmits messages through a less verbose protocol. Owing to the ubiquitous availability of WiFi, all the appliances within home can be connected through a common gateway.

This in turn has led to speedy installations of base station transmitters, thus making the process of planning and fine-tuning the location of these BS transmitters very difficult. To plan and optimize mobile cellular networks for acceptable level of service coverage and quality at the mobile station terminals, radio network engineers rely on propagation loss prediction models. This research work investigates the application of a neural hybridized model for field signal strength attenuation prediction. The hybridized model combines a conventional Log-distance model and an adaptive neural network model. The adaptive neural model employs a multilayer Levenberg Marquardt back propagation algorithm to reimburse for the prediction errors obtained by means of using only the conventional model in urban microcellular environment. After applying a number of first order statistical indicators such standard deviation and root mean square error for a comprehensive performance evaluation, the hybrid - based algorithm provides more accurate prediction results with measured values compared to the conventional approach. The computationally effective prediction technique of the hybrid based neural network model can be used for standardization and enhancement of the conventional field strength propagation loss prediction methods.","doi":"10.1109/R10-HTC.2016.7906853","pdfPath":"/iel7/7898714/7906774/07906853.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Region 10 Humanitarian Technology Conference (R10-HTC)","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Region 10 Humanitarian Technology Conference (R10-HTC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/R10-HTC.2016.7906853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7906774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid neural network approach for predicting signal propagation loss in urban microcells","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906853/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid neural network approach for predicting signal propagation loss in urban microcells","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","accessionNumber":"16837059","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7906853/","conferenceDate":"21-23 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid neural network approach for predicting signal propagation loss in urban microcells","confLoc":"Agra, India","sourcePdf":"IEEEHTC2016SOFT20.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041697S","chronDate":"21-23 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7898714","isNumber":"7906774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7898714","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7906774","articleId":"7906853","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-25"},{"_id":7906883,"authors":[{"name":"Katherine Bourzac","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Katherine","lastName":"Bourzac","id":"37085816956"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9235"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9340"}],"articleNumber":"7906883","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1403},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/"}],"abstract":"Today's computers shuttle data around a byzantine system of several different kinds of short- and long-term memory.

Small and shiny, packing 74 minutes of music, it seemed magical, even more magical when you noticed that you could treat a disc pretty badly before physical damage affected the way it played.

In most cases, insiders have authorized access in file systems containing such data which they misuse or exfiltrate for financial profit. Moreover, external parties can compromise identity credentials of valid file system users by means of exploiting security vulnerabilities, phishing attacks etc. Therefore, in order to protect sensitive information from such attackers, security measures, e.g., access control and encryption are often combined with anomaly detection. Anomaly detection is based on the key observation that the access behavior of an attacker is significantly different from the regular access pattern of a benign user. However, due to the complexity of users' interactions with a file system, the modeling of user profiles is a challenging problem. As a result, most of the existing anomaly detection techniques suffer from poor user profiles that contribute to high false positive and high false negative rates. In this paper, we propose an approach that as a first step discovers the users' tasks (sets of file accesses that represent distinct file system activities) by applying frequent sequence mining on the access log. In the next step, our approach builds robust temporal user profiles by extensively analyzing the timestamp information of users' file system accesses and thus precisely models the relation between the users' tasks and their temporal properties using a multilevel temporal data structure. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our approach on a real dataset.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 14th Annual Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust (PST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7899233/7906913/07906928.pdf","startPage":"207","endPage":"210","publicationTitle":"2016 14th Annual Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust (PST)","doi":"10.1109/PST.2016.7906928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PST.2016.7906928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7906913","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Building robust temporal user profiles for anomaly detection in file system accesses","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Data structures","Buildings","Access control","Automata","Time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["file system authorized access","sensitive data protection","financial profit","regular access pattern","anomaly detection technique","robust temporal user profile","multilevel temporal data structure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906928/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Building robust temporal user profiles for anomaly detection in file system accesses","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7906928/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16837188","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Building robust temporal user profiles for anomaly detection in file system accesses","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"Session_One-Paper_115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05334S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7899233","isNumber":"7906913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7899233","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7906913","articleId":"7906928","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7906930,"authors":[{"name":"Janice Ca\u00f1edo","affiliation":["Auburn Cyber Research Center, Samuel Ginn College of Engineering Auburn University"],"firstName":"Janice","lastName":"Ca\u00f1edo","id":"37086050344"},{"name":"Anthony Skjellum","affiliation":["Auburn Cyber Research Center, Samuel Ginn College of Engineering Auburn University"],"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Skjellum","id":"37347707700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4379-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4380-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7906930","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":5191},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological neural networks","Sensors","Security","Logic gates","Neurons","Delays","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","Internet of Things","internetworking","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine learning","IoT system security","Internet of Things","wired network","wireless network","IoT gateway","artificial neural network","anomaly detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Internet of Things","Security","Machine Learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906930","abstract":"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a massive group of devices containing sensors or actuators connected together over wired or wireless networks.

When implementing security within an IoT network, there are several challenges including heterogeneity within the system as well as the quantity of devices that need to be addressed. To approach the challenges in securing IoT devices, we propose using machine learning within an IoT gateway to help secure the system. We investigate using Artificial Neural Networks in a gateway to detect anomalies in the data sent from the edge devices.

While pseudonyms are, in most cases, sufficient, mechanisms must be put in place to prevent malicious adversaries from registering great numbers of sybil identities. Preventing such sybil attacks becomes an especially significant challenge when the existence of a trusted party cannot be assumed. Several countermeasures against sybil attacks on decentralized systems have been proposed that are based on leveraging information from the social graph between participating users. While promising, existing solutions typically require knowledge of the complete social graph, which is a privacy issue, or are tailored towards specific applications like distributed hash tables. In this paper, we propose an approach for registering general-purpose pseudonyms in a completely decentralized manner while keeping social relationships private. Joining users collect confirmations from a fraction of already registered users while being aware only of their own neighbors in the social graph. Using the presented SybilHedge algorithm, sybil attackers are limited in the number of confirmations they can collect. We present an evaluation of the algorithm and discuss its practical application.","doi":"10.1109/PST.2016.7906946","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PST.2016.7906946","publicationTitle":"2016 14th Annual Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust (PST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 14th Annual Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust (PST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7899233/7906913/07906946.pdf","startPage":"121","endPage":"128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7906913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized and sybil-resistant pseudonym registration using social graphs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906946/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Decentralized and sybil-resistant pseudonym registration using social graphs","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16824922","htmlLink":"/document/7906946/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized and sybil-resistant pseudonym registration using social graphs","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"Session_One-Paper_66.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04929S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7899233","isNumber":"7906913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7899233","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7906913","articleId":"7906946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7906954,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid Ebadi","affiliation":["Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Ebadi","id":"37089110840"},{"name":"Thibaud Antignac","affiliation":["Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Thibaud","lastName":"Antignac","id":"37085430962"},{"name":"David Sands","affiliation":["Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Sands","id":"37437728300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4379-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4380-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7906954","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":262},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Privacy","Sampling methods","Data privacy","Sensitivity","Sociology","Machine learning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data privacy","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential privacy","effective enforcement mechanism","privacy budget","key mechanism","PINQ","formal theory","internal mechanics","sampling operation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906954","abstract":"Differential privacy enjoys increasing popularity thanks to both a precise semantics for privacy and effective enforcement mechanisms. Many tools have been proposed to spread its use and ease the task of the concerned data scientist. The most promising among them completely discharge the user of the privacy concerns by transparently taking care of the privacy budget. However, their implementation proves to be delicate, and introduce flaws by falsifying some of the theoretical assumptions made to guarantee differential privacy. Moreover, such tools rely on assumptions leading to over-approximations which artificially reduce utility. In this paper we focus on a key mechanism that tools do not support well: sampling. We demonstrate an attack on PINQ (McSherry, SIGMOD 2009), one of these tools, relying on the difference between its internal mechanics and the formal theory for the sampling operation, and study a range of sampling methods and show how they can be correctly implemented in a system for differential privacy.","doi":"10.1109/PST.2016.7906954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PST.2016.7906954","startPage":"664","endPage":"673","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 14th Annual Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust (PST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7899233/7906913/07906954.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 14th Annual Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust (PST)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7906913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling and partitioning for differential privacy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Sampling and partitioning for differential privacy","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7906954/","accessionNumber":"16824879","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906954/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling and partitioning for differential privacy","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"Session_One_Paper_71.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071682S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7899233","isNumber":"7906913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7899233","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7906913","articleId":"7906954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":7906962,"authors":[{"name":"Mehmood Baryalai","affiliation":["CS/IT, Massey University, NZ"],"firstName":"Mehmood","lastName":"Baryalai","id":"37086129589"},{"name":"Julian Jang-Jaccard","affiliation":["CS/IT, Massey University, NZ"],"firstName":"Julian","lastName":"Jang-Jaccard","id":"37086132654"},{"name":"Dongxi Liu","affiliation":["Data61, CSIRO, Australia"],"firstName":"Dongxi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37402810300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4379-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4380-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7906962","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":463},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906962","abstract":"The requirement for data privacy is limiting to exploit the full potential of what modern data analytic capability could offer.

The inherently complex nature and quantity of network data impedes detecting attacks in real world settings. In this paper, we utilize features of network flows, characterized by their entropy, together with an extended version of the original Replicator Neural Network (RNN) and deep learning techniques to learn models of normality. This combination allows us to apply anomaly-based intrusion detection on arbitrarily large amounts of data and, consequently, large networks. Our approach is unsupervised and requires no labeled data. It also accurately detects network-wide anomalies without presuming that the training data is completely free of attacks. The evaluation of our intrusion detection method, on top of real network data, indicates that it can accurately detect resource exhaustion attacks and network profiling techniques of varying intensities. The developed method is efficient because a normality model can be learned by training an RNN within a few seconds only.","doi":"10.1109/PST.2016.7906980","publicationTitle":"2016 14th Annual Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust (PST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 14th Annual Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust (PST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7899233/7906913/07906980.pdf","startPage":"317","endPage":"324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PST.2016.7906980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7906913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analyzing flow-based anomaly intrusion detection using Replicator Neural Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906980","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7906980/","displayDocTitle":"Analyzing flow-based anomaly intrusion detection using Replicator Neural Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16837193","htmlLink":"/document/7906980/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing flow-based anomaly intrusion detection using Replicator Neural Networks","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"Session_Three-Paper_74.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066789S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7899233","isNumber":"7906913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7899233","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7906913","articleId":"7906980","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7906988,"authors":[{"name":"Ujan Mukhopadhyay","affiliation":["Auburn Cyber Research Center Auburn University"],"firstName":"Ujan","lastName":"Mukhopadhyay","id":"37086108203"},{"name":"Anthony Skjellum","affiliation":["Auburn Cyber Research Center Auburn University"],"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Skjellum","id":"37085551709"},{"name":"Oluwakemi Hambolu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering Clemson University"],"firstName":"Oluwakemi","lastName":"Hambolu","id":"37086102217"},{"name":"Jon Oakley","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering Clemson University"],"firstName":"Jon","lastName":"Oakley","id":"37086104889"},{"name":"Lu Yu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering Clemson University"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086105576"},{"name":"Richard Brooks","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering Clemson University"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Brooks","id":"37273515000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4379-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4380-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7906988","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":68,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":5717},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Online banking","Data mining","Computers","Data structures","Algorithm design and analysis","Peer-to-peer computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","data mining","foreign exchange trading","peer-to-peer computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptocurrency systems","financial software systems","secure distributed ledger data structure","Blockchain","peer-to-peer systems","secure mining algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cryptocurrency","Mining","Blockchain"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7906988","abstract":"Cryptocurrencies have emerged as important financial software systems.

They rely on miners to validate transactions. Cryptocurrencies require strong, secure mining algorithms. In this paper we survey and compare and contrast current mining techniques as used by major Cryptocurrencies. We evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, and possible threats to each mining strategy.

Due to its superior performance and the protograph structure which facilitates high-speed encoding and decoding, the protograph codes have shown a high potential to tackle 2-D-ISI. However, so far, no work has been reported on the design of non-binary protograph-based low-density parity-check (NP-LDPC) codes for 2-D-ISI channels. In this paper, we first propose a modified protograph extrinsic information transfer analysis. In conjunction with the asymptotic ensemble weight distribution analysis, they both serve as theoretical tools to analyze the performance of NP-LDPC codes designed for the 2-D-ISI channels. By further applying a fast search approach, we construct two types of NP-LDPC codes for 2-D-ISI channels. Both theoretical analyses and simulated results show that the proposed codes outperform the existing binary LDPC codes that optimized for 2-D-ISI channels as well as the non-binary quasi-cyclic LDPC code, at both low and high SNR regions.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2017.2697075","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/8082142/07907160.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8082142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2017.2697075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Binary Protograph-Based LDPC Codes for 2-D-ISI Magnetic Recording Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7907160","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Non-Binary Protograph-Based LDPC Codes for 2-D-ISI Magnetic Recording Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907160/","externalId":"8108905","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17282729","htmlLink":"/document/7907160/","volume":"53","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"SUTD-MIT IDC"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401099 and 61501250"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Binary Protograph-Based LDPC Codes for 2-D-ISI Magnetic Recording Channels","sourcePdf":"tmag-kui-2697075-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088021S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"8082142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8082142","articleId":"7907160","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7907177,"authors":[{"name":"Wenying Du","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping, and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China","Collaborative Innovation Center of Geospatial Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/8233431/7907177/du-2686640-small.gif","p":["Wenying Du received the B.S. degree in geographic information system\n from the North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power, Zhengzhou, China, in 2011.

Based on the balloon snake (B-snake) method, an outstanding representative of TIPS, this paper proposed the automatic B-snake (AB-snake) method capable of automatic initialization and topology transformation to overcome the drawbacks of nonautomatic initialization and topology inflexibility of the B-snake method while ensuring both high accuracy and efficiency of TFPS. Six GF-1 wide field view satellite images covering different inner island numbers, water body sizes, boundary complexities, boundary clarities, and background complexities were used as experimental images. To test its feasibility and advantages, the extracted results of the AB-snake method were compared with those of the B-snake and the orthogonal topology adaptive snake (OT-snake) methods, a newer representative of TFPS. The results demonstrated that the AB-snake method could effectively implement automatic initialization and topology transformation, successfully meeting its design objectives. Four indices, including correctness, completeness, area overlap measure, and efficiency, were adopted to quantitatively assess the performances of the B-snake, the AB-snake, and the OT-snake methods. The results suggested that the proposed AB-snake method not only significantly outperformed the B-snake method in topology collision handling but also demonstrated great advantages over the OT-snake method in accuracy. The applicability, sensitivity, parameter selection, and limitations of the AB-snake method were also elaborated.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Boundary conditions","Satellite communication","Topology","Remote sensing","Water resources","Informatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","geophysical image processing","image segmentation","remote sensing","topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic balloon snake method","topology adaptive water boundary extraction","GF-1 satellite imagery","topology adaptive boundary extraction","topology inflexible parametric snakes","topology flexible parametric snakes","automatic B-snake","automatic initialization","topology transformation","nonautomatic initialization","topology inflexibility","B-snake method","AB-snake method","orthogonal topology adaptive snake methods","OT-snake method","topology collision handling","TIPS","TFPS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic initialization","balloon snake (B-snake)","boundary extraction","topology flexibility","water"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2686640","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/8233431/07907177.pdf","startPage":"5381","endPage":"5394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8233431","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2686640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Balloon Snake Method for Topology Adaptive Water Boundary Extraction: Using GF-1 Satellite Imagery as an Example","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7907177","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Balloon Snake Method for Topology Adaptive Water Boundary Extraction: Using GF-1 Satellite Imagery as an Example","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907177/","volume":"10","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7907177/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17452363","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Union Foundation of Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China","grantNumber":"6141A02022318"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003819","fundingName":"Creative Research Groups of Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province of China","grantNumber":"2016CFA003"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2013AA01A608"},{"fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China Program","grantNumber":"41301441"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Balloon Snake Method for Topology Adaptive Water Boundary Extraction: Using GF-1 Satellite Imagery as an Example","sourcePdf":"jstars-pt2-du-2686640-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093321S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"8233431","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","xplore-issue":"8233431","articleId":"7907177","onlineDate":"21 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7907179,"authors":[{"name":"Liangliang Zheng","affiliation":["Fine Mechanics and Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun Institute of Optics, Changchun, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7932554/7907179/zheng-2696562-small.gif","p":["Liangliang Zheng received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mechanical and electronic engineering from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2005 and 2007, respectively.

Therefore, in order to achieve images with high signal-to-noise ratio by the TDI CCD sensor, the noise model of the imaging system is investigated. First, the design of the imaging circuit system is presented, and the main noises of the system are analyzed, such as the TDI CCD sensor, amplifiers, and so on. Then a theoretical noise model of the imaging system is established as a priori information. An improved least square fitting method of parameter estimation is proposed. To validate the theoretical model and the proposed method, extensive tests are carried out to obtain multiple uniform images on a developed TDI CCD imaging system.

We formulate the relay power minimization problem under both the secrecy rate constraint and the EH constraint, which is non-convex and hard to tackle. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-level optimization approach, which involves 1-D search and the semi-definite relaxation. In addition, we testify that the SDR can obtain the rank-one optimal solution.

The relay forwards the decoded and interleaved information sequence even though the information part may contain error(s), according to the lossy forward strategy. In spatially independent MIMO channels, we find that the diversity order of the relay network can be interpreted and formulated by the well-known max-flow min-cut theorem. Moreover, we extend the analysis to the case of spatially correlated MIMO channels.

In Liguria, a coastal region of Northwestern Italy, climate and vegetation conditions are different from Lombardy; in both winter and summer, severe forest fires frequently occur. This study is based on the investigation of winter fire regimes characterizing the aforementioned regions, using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. In particular, we compare the RST-FIRES and the well-established MOD14/MYD14 fire detection products in order to assess their performance in detecting winter fires in Northern Italy. The study shows as a result that, despite the advantages offered by selfadaptive algorithms like RST-FIRES at local/regional scale, wildfires occurring in Lombardy during the winter season are challenging to identify by satellite. In Liguria region, where morphological and weather conditions favor flame propagation, they seem to be better detectable from space. This study aims at investigating issues affecting satellite monitoring of winter fires by encouraging the usage of a multiplatform observing system, integrating data provided by the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) aboard Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites, for better supporting fire management activities.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2670059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2670059","startPage":"3297","endPage":"3313","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/8000454/07907195.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8000454","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Issues and Possible Improvements in Winter Fires Detection by Satellite Radiances Analysis: Lesson Learned in Two Regions of Northern Italy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","displayDocTitle":"Issues and Possible Improvements in Winter Fires Detection by Satellite Radiances Analysis: Lesson Learned in Two Regions of Northern Italy","publicationDate":"July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"02 August 2017","volume":"10","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7907195/","accessionNumber":"17132592","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907195/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"DG Civil Protection of Lombardy Region"},{"fundingName":"ERSAF (Lombardy Region)"},{"fundingName":"University of Milano Bicocca"},{"fundingName":"IReR","grantNumber":"2006B008 and 2007B022"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Issues and Possible Improvements in Winter Fires Detection by Satellite Radiances Analysis: Lesson Learned in Two Regions of Northern Italy","sourcePdf":"jstars-marchese-2670059-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.254217S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"8000454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","xplore-issue":"8000454","articleId":"7907195","onlineDate":"21 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7907197,"authors":[{"name":"Yuchen Guo","affiliation":["School of Software, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/7922633/7907197/guo-2696747-small.gif","p":["Yuchen Guo received the B.Sc. degree from the School of Software, and the B.Ec. degree from the School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Software.

Conventional ZSL approaches usually adopt a two-step recognition strategy, in which the test sample is projected into an intermediary space in the first step, and then the recognition is carried out by considering the similarity between the sample and target classes in the intermediary space. Due to this redundant intermediate transformation, information loss is unavoidable, thus degrading the performance of overall system. Rather than adopting this two-step strategy, in this paper, we propose a novel one-step recognition framework that is able to perform recognition in the original feature space by using directly trained classifiers. To address the lack of labeled samples for training supervised classifiers for the target classes, we propose to transfer samples from source classes with pseudo labels assigned, in which the transferred samples are selected based on their transferability and diversity. Moreover, to account for the unreliability of pseudo labels of transferred samples, we modify the standard support vector machine formulation such that the unreliable positive samples can be recognized and suppressed in the training phase. The entire framework is fairly general with the possibility of further extensions to several common ZSL settings. Extensive experiments on four benchmark data sets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, in various settings.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7922633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2017.2696747","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7922633/07907197.pdf","startPage":"3277","endPage":"3290","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2017.2696747","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zero-Shot Learning With Transferred Samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","displayDocTitle":"Zero-Shot Learning With Transferred Samples","volume":"26","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7907197/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"16880416","dateOfInsertion":"09 May 2017","pubMedId":"28436875","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907197/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571269 and 61671267"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000288","fundingName":"Royal Society Newton Mobility","grantNumber":"IE150997"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero-Shot Learning With Transferred Samples","sourcePdf":"tip-ding-2696747-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09125S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7922633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7922633","articleId":"7907197","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7907198,"authors":[{"name":"Insun Jang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul"],"bio":{"p":["Insun Jang (zerantoss@korea.ac.kr) received his B.S. degree from Korea University, Seoul, in 2011.

Compared with the conventional separate N-output isolated converter, which employs 2N primary switches, only N+1 switches are required in the primary side of proposed converters to independently regulate N secondary output voltages. Therefore, the number of switches is greatly reduced, contributing to lower cost. In this paper, detailed topology derivation is first introduced. A diversity of integrated multiple output topologies is derived with different cell connections and different cell configurations, including the asymmetrical flyback, forward as well as a half-bridge. Their performance characteristics are different and thus they are suitable for different applications. Then, in order to obtain a comprehensive insight of the proposed converters, a simplified dual-output asymmetrical flyback converter with three primary switches is taken as an example to be introduced in detail. Each output voltage in the converter is regulated with individual duty cycle, and zero voltage-switching operation is achieved for all switches over the whole load range. Finally, experimental results based on a prototype circuit with two 12-V/3-A and 5-V/4.8-A outputs are also provided to validate converter effectiveness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907199/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","volume":"64","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"17048537","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7907199/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Topology Derivation and Analysis of Integrated Multiple Output Isolated DC\u2013DC Converters With Stacked Configuration for Low-Cost Applications","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51377144 and 51611130196"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topology Derivation and Analysis of Integrated Multiple Output Isolated DC\u2013DC Converters With Stacked Configuration for Low-Cost Applications","sourcePdf":"tcsi-deng-2683506-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.164776S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7992992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7992992","articleId":"7907199","onlineDate":"21 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7907206,"authors":[{"name":"Enea Cippitelli","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7932554/7907206/cippi-2697077-small.gif","p":["Enea Cippitelli received the bachelor\u2019s degree and the master\u2019s (Hons.) degree in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree from Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy, in 2010, 2012, and 2017, respectively.

The interest in radar and RGB-D sensors is related to their capability to enable contactless and non-intrusive monitoring, which is an advantage for practical deployment and users' acceptance and compliance, compared with other sensor technologies, such as video-cameras, or wearables. Furthermore, the possibility of combining and fusing information from The heterogeneous types of sensors is expected to improve the overall performance of practical fall detection systems.

A per-subcarrier (PSC) channel equalizer was derived under the assumption of low frequency selectivity. However, this equalization scheme cannot be directly applied to highly frequency selective channels without performance degradation. In this letter, we analyze the received signal after demodulation without any assumption on the channel selectivity. We develop a general closed-form expression for the equivalent channel seen at the demodulator. Furthermore, we design the associate channel equalizer. Simulation results demonstrate that the developed equalizer performs as equally with the previous PSC equalizer in the case of low frequency selectivity, and outperforms the PSC equalizer in highly frequency selective channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/7901503/07907209.pdf","startPage":"897","endPage":"901","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2017.2697079","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2017.2697079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7901503","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7907209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the FFT-FBMC Equalization in Selective Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equalizers","Demodulation","Indexes","OFDM","Frequency modulation","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","demodulation","equalisers","fast Fourier transforms","frequency selective surfaces","modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FFT-FBMC equalization analysis","fast Fourier transform filter-bank multicarrier modulation","multiple-input multiple-output technique","MIMO technique","intrinsic interference elimination","persubcarrier channel equalizer","PSC channel equalizer","frequency selective channel","demodulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel equalization","FFT-FBMC","filter-bank multicarrier","frequency selective channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907209/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the FFT-FBMC Equalization in Selective Channels","volume":"24","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7907209/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16862727","dateOfInsertion":"04 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001665","fundingName":"French National Research Agency (ANR) Project ACCENT5","grantNumber":"ANR-14-CE28-0026-02"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the FFT-FBMC Equalization in Selective Channels","sourcePdf":"lsp-zakaria-2697079-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050293S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"7901503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7901503","articleId":"7907209","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7907212,"authors":[{"name":"Fatma Benkhelifa","affiliation":["Division of Computer, Electrical, and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7511293/7930359/7907212/benkh-2696976-small.gif","p":["Fatma Benkhelifa (S\u201912) was born in Tunis, Tunisia.

The secondary transmitter (ST) selects only one antenna, which maximizes the received signal-to-noise ratio at the secondary receiver (SR) and minimizes the interference induced at the primary receiver (PR). Moreover, PR is an energy harvesting node using the antenna switching, which assigns a subset of its antennas to harvest the energy and assigns the rest to decode its information data. The objective of this paper is to show that the SS is advantageous for both SR and PR sides and leads to a win-win situation. To illustrate the incentive of the SS in CR network, we evaluate the energy and data performance metrics in terms of the average harvested energy, the power outage, and the mutual outage probability, which declares a data outage event if the PR or SR is in an outage. We present some special cases and asymptotic results of the derived analytic results. Through the simulation results, we show the impact of various simulation parameters and the benefits due to the presence of ST.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/7511293/7930359/07907212.pdf","startPage":"204","endPage":"222","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking","doi":"10.1109/TGCN.2017.2696976","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGCN.2017.2696976","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7930359","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7907212","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proactive Spectrum Sharing for SWIPT in MIMO Cognitive Radio Systems Using Antenna Switching Technique","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","MIMO","Interference","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cognitive radio","energy harvesting","MIMO communication","radio spectrum management","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["proactive spectrum sharing","simultaneous wireless information power transfer","SWIPT","multiple-input multiple-output cognitive radio network","MIMO cognitive radio systems","antenna switching technique","secondary transmitter","received signal-to-noise ratio","secondary receiver","primary receiver","energy harvesting node","information data decoding","power outage","mutual outage probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio (CR)","spectrum sharing (SS)","energy harvesting (EH)","antenna switching (AS)","transmit antenna selection","average harvested energy","power outage (PO)","primary/secondary data outage probability","mutual outage probability (MOP)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907212/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Proactive Spectrum Sharing for SWIPT in MIMO Cognitive Radio Systems Using Antenna Switching Technique","volume":"1","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7907212/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16885163","dateOfInsertion":"17 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004052","fundingName":"Sensor Research Initiative through the Office of Sponsored Research, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proactive Spectrum Sharing for SWIPT in MIMO Cognitive Radio Systems Using Antenna Switching Technique","sourcePdf":"tgcn-benkhelifa-2696976-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126397S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7511293","isNumber":"7930359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7511293","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7930359","articleId":"7907212","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7907214,"authors":[{"name":"Alberto Mengali","affiliation":["University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8068314/7907214/menga-2696952-small.gif","p":["Alberto Mengali was born in Pisa in 1987.

Lately, contention resolution diversity slotted ALOHA (CRDSA) and its variants have contributed to a drastic improvement in throughput compared with the traditional slotted ALOHA protocols. In this paper, we further enhance the CRDSA flexibility and performance along different physical layer dimensions. Based on simulation results, we show that there is still room for improvement in terms of throughput and, using heuristic methods, we find an optimized distribution of the packets power that is entering the demodulator for an additive white Gaussian noise channel. Applying this power distribution, which is easy to implement at the terminal in open loop and in a decentralized manner, is shown to achieve significantly enhanced performance. By introducing multi-frequency CRDSA, a drastic reduction in the terminal's peak power requirement is attained. Furthermore, we investigate spread spectrum CRDSA, which improves the robustness of the scheme against irresolvable packet collisions allowing for enhanced energy efficiency. To support the work presented herein, we have developed a computationally efficient yet accurate methodology for estimating CRDSA performance, a novel approximate centrally coordinated CRDSA achievable sum rate analysis accounting for modulation and forward error correction constraints, as well as a more accurate loop probability analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907214/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","volume":"65","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"17256481","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7907214/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing the Physical Layer of Contention Resolution Diversity Slotted ALOHA","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing the Physical Layer of Contention Resolution Diversity Slotted ALOHA","sourcePdf":"tcomm-degaudenzi-2696952-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122254S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8068314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"8068314","articleId":"7907214","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7907218,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The arrays consisted of seven divergent hexagonal waveguides with different separations between the waveguides at the exit of the crystal. Optical characterization in the visible (633 nm) and near infrared (800 nm) was performed. The obtained modal profiles show multimodal behavior in the visible and nearly single-mode at 800 nm. The propagation losses were measured to be 1.6-3.0 dB/cm in all the cases. Microluminescence maps were obtained showing the presence of defects only at the damage tracks and a residual stress that slightly affects the waveguide core in the vicinity of the tracks. This affected area is responsible for a modal profile distortion that can be clearly seen at 633 nm, but does not modify the modal profiles in the near infrared. Our results show a very good performance of the fabricated structures and suggest a promising potential use in photonic applications (i.e., photonic lanterns) that can be easily implemented in other transparent materials.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2017.2696163","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7932275/07907222.pdf","startPage":"2520","endPage":"2525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2017.2696163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7932275","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Depressed-Cladding 3-D Waveguide Arrays Fabricated With Femtosecond Laser Pulses","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7907222","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"July1, 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907222/","displayDocTitle":"Depressed-Cladding 3-D Waveguide Arrays Fabricated With Femtosecond Laser Pulses","volume":"35","issue":"13","publicationDate":"1 July1, 2017","accessionNumber":"16898830","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7907222/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Junta de Castilla y Le\u00f3n","grantNumber":"UIC016 and SA046U16"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003329","fundingName":"MINECO","grantNumber":"FIS2013-44174-P and FIS2015-71933-REDT"},{"fundingName":"Spanish Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n y Ciencia","grantNumber":"MAT2013-47395-C4-1-R and MAT2016-75362-C3-1-R"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004593","fundingName":"Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid"},{"fundingName":"Formaci\u00f3n de Personal Investigador (FPI-UAM)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Depressed-Cladding 3-D Waveguide Arrays Fabricated With Femtosecond Laser Pulses","sourcePdf":"jlt-castillo-2696163-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067579S","chronDate":"July1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7932275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7932275","articleId":"7907222","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7907225,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Zhang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu"],"bio":{"p":["Ke Zhang (zhangke@uestc.edu.cn) is a lecturer and Ph.D. degree candidate in the School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu.

To further reduce the latency and the transmission cost of the computation off-loading, we propose a cloud-based mobileedge computing (MEC) off-loading framework in vehicular networks. In this framework, we study the effectiveness of the computation transfer strategies with vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication modes. Considering the time consumption of the computation task execution and the mobility of the vehicles, we present an efficient predictive combination-mode relegation scheme, where the tasks are adaptively off-loaded to the MEC servers through direct uploading or predictive relay transmissions.

In this paper, we solve this challenging problem by considering fixed-time synchronization of complex networks (CNs) with impulsive effects. By designing a new Lyapunov function and constructing comparison systems, a sufficient condition formulated by matrix inequalities is given to ensure that all the dynamical subsystems in the CNs are synchronized with an isolated system in a settling time, which is independent of the initial values of both the CNs and the isolated system. Then, by partitioning impulse interval and using the convex combination technique, sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities are provided. Our synchronization criteria unify synchronizing and desynchronizing impulses. Compared with the existing controllers for fixed-time and finite-time techniques, the designed controller is continuous and does not include any sign function, and hence, the chattering phenomenon in most of the existing results is overcome. An optimal algorithm is proposed for the estimation of the settling time. Numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of our new results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907236/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","volume":"62","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"17284902","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7907236/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fixed-Time Synchronization of Complex Networks With Impulsive Effects via Nonchattering Control","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61673078"},{"fundingName":"HKU CRCG","grantNumber":"201511159067"},{"fundingName":"Council of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region"},{"fundingName":"CityU","grantNumber":"11204514"},{"fundingName":"CityU","grantNumber":"11300415"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fixed-Time Synchronization of Complex Networks With Impulsive Effects via Nonchattering Control","sourcePdf":"tac-yang-2691303-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.17732S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"8082390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"8082390","articleId":"7907236","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7907238,"authors":[{"name":"Israel Alejandro Arriaga-Trejo","affiliation":["CONACYT - Autonomous University of Zacatecas, Zacatecas, C.

Their design typically involves the minimization of a nonlinear function that strives to make equal to zero the correlation coefficients in a region of interest. In this letter, the design of unimodular sequences whose aperiodic autocorrelation and aperiodic complementary autocorrelation vanish for a given set of lags is proposed. The sequences are obtained by minimizing a generalized weighted integrated sidelobe level that depends on their complete second-order characterization. Numerical results show that the proposed sequences are ideally suited to identify strictly linear as well as widely linear systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/7953750/07907238.pdf","startPage":"1153","endPage":"1157","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2017.2696950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2017.2696950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7953750","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7907238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Unimodular Sequences With Good Autocorrelation and Good Complementary Autocorrelation Properties","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Minimization","Linear programming","Channel estimation","Signal processing algorithms","Linear systems","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation theory","minimisation","nonlinear functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unimodular sequence design","good complementary autocorrelation properties","complex sequences","aperiodic autocorrelation properties","time domain properties","nonlinear function minimization","weighted integrated side-lobe level","second-order characterization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complementary correlation","correlation","unimodular sequences"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907238/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Design of Unimodular Sequences With Good Autocorrelation and Good Complementary Autocorrelation Properties","volume":"24","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7907238/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"16969739","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007350","fundingName":"Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda","grantNumber":"3066"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Unimodular Sequences With Good Autocorrelation and Good Complementary Autocorrelation Properties","sourcePdf":"lsp-arriagatrejo-2696950-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137205S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"7953750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7953750","articleId":"7907238","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7907239,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Wang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7907239/wang-2693440-small.gif","p":["Xiang Wang received the B.Eng. degree from Hunan University.

In F-RANs, distributed edge caching techniques among remote radio heads (RRHs) and user equipment (UE) can effectively alleviate the burdens on the fronthaul toward the base band unit pool and the bandwidth of the RANs. However, it is still not clear as to how social relationships affect the performance of edge caching schemes. This paper attempts to analyze the impact of mobile social networks (MSNs) on the performance of edge caching in F-RANs. We propose a Markov-chain-based model to analyze edge caching among edge nodes (i.e., RRHs and MSNs), as well as data sharing among the potential MSNs from the viewpoint of content diffusion in the F-RANs. Moreover, we analyze the edge caching schemes among UE to minimize the bandwidth consumption in the RANs. Finally, the optimal edge caching strategies among RRHs in terms of caching locations and time are introduced to minimize the bandwidth consumption of fronthaul and storage costs in the F-RANs. Simulation results show that the proposed edge caching schemes among UE and RRHs are able to reduce the bandwidth consumption of RANs and fronthaul effectively.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2693440","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07907239.pdf","startPage":"8492","endPage":"8501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2693440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Social-Aware Edge Caching in Fog Radio Access Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7907239","topic":"Wireless Cachiing Technique for 5G","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","displayDocTitle":"Social-Aware Edge Caching in Fog Radio Access Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907239/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16904729","htmlLink":"/document/7907239/","volume":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61374189"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China","grantNumber":"ZYGX2016Z011"},{"fundingName":"EU FP7 Project CLIMBER","grantNumber":"PIRSES-GA-2012-318939"},{"fundingName":"EU FP7 Project CROWN","grantNumber":"GA-2013-610524"},{"fundingName":"UK EPSRC Project NIRVANA","grantNumber":"EP/L026031/1"},{"fundingName":"UK EPSRC Project DANCER","grantNumber":"EP/K002643/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"Program of the China Scholarship Council","grantNumber":"201506070049"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Social-Aware Edge Caching in Fog Radio Access Networks","sourcePdf":"access-leng-2693440-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157443S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Wireless Cachiing Technique for 5G"],"articleId":"7907239","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7907241,"authors":[{"name":"Ryan Shea","affiliation":["Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7907241/shea-2696953-small.gif","p":["Ryan Shea (S\u201908\u2013M\u201916) is currently a University Research Associate in big data systems at Simon Fraser University.

Since, the previous visualization methods of multivariable volume data are not intuitive and difficult to operate, we propose a novel framework of visualizing multivariable volume data, which combines subspace clustering with radial coordinate visualization (RadViz) from the global pattern analysis to the local feature exploration. Since multivariable data generally have a large data size, the feature sampling is performed to extract some representative points. In order to explore the features interactively, the sample points extracted from high-dimensional space are projected into a low-dimensional space. Through selecting different sample points interactively, users can switch and explore different subspaces in real-time. For the further analysis of the local details in the selected subspace, we utilize the RadViz technique to present the data patterns in the subspace. Thus, the relationships of the data among different dimensions can be recognized intuitively. The result of the experiment shows that our method can help users explore the complex features in volume data deeply and express the data patterns among different dimensions exactly. The constructed system based on subspace analysis and multidimensional projection visualization can improve the efficiency of analyzing multivariable volume data and guarantee the real-time volume rendering.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Transfer functions","Rendering (computer graphics)","Feature extraction","Clustering methods","Data mining","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","data visualisation","feature extraction","interactive systems","pattern clustering","rendering (computer graphics)","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multidimensional projection visualization","complex features","data patterns","RadViz technique","sample point selection","low-dimensional space","high-dimensional space","large data size","feature sampling","local feature exploration","global pattern analysis","radial coordinate visualization","subspace clustering","scientific visualization","real-time volume rendering","subspace analysis","interactive multivariable volume data visualization","SAMP-Viz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multivariable volume data","subspace clustering","RadViz","volume rendering","multidimensional projection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2696739","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07907253.pdf","startPage":"7636","endPage":"7647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2696739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAMP-Viz: An Interactive Multivariable Volume Visualization Framework Based on Subspace Analysis and Multidimensional Projection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7907253","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SAMP-Viz: An Interactive Multivariable Volume Visualization Framework Based on Subspace Analysis and Multidimensional Projection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907253/","volume":"5","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","htmlLink":"/document/7907253/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16904736","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41671379"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China for Young Scholars","grantNumber":"41101434"},{"fundingName":"Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China","grantNumber":"20130043110016"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007847","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jilin Province","grantNumber":"20140101179JC"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"SAMP-Viz: An Interactive Multivariable Volume Visualization Framework Based on Subspace Analysis and Multidimensional Projection","sourcePdf":"access-zhang-2696739-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110661S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7907253","onlineDate":"21 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7907280,"authors":[{"name":"Saiprasad Ravishankar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6745852/8098624/7907280/ravis-2697206-small.gif","p":["Saiprasad Ravishankar received the B.Tech. degree in electrical\n engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India, in 2008, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in\n electrical and computer engineering, in 2010 and 2014, respectively, from the University of Illinois at\n Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, IL, USA, where he was an Adjunct Lecturer in the Department of Electrical and Computer\n Engineering during Spring 2015, and a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Coordinated Science Laboratory until\n August 2015.

More recently, data-driven adaptation of synthesis dictionaries has shown promise compared to analytical dictionary models. However, dictionary learning problems are typically nonconvex and NP-hard, and the usual alternating minimization approaches for these problems are often computationally expensive, with the computations dominated by the NP-hard synthesis sparse coding step. This paper exploits the ideas that drive algorithms such as K-SVD, and investigates in detail efficient methods for aggregate sparsity penalized dictionary learning by first approximating the data with a sum of sparse rank-one matrices (outer products) and then using a block coordinate descent approach to estimate the unknowns. The resulting block coordinate descent algorithms involve efficient closed-form solutions. Furthermore, we consider the problem of dictionary-blind image reconstruction, and propose novel and efficient algorithms for adaptive image reconstruction using block coordinate descent and sum of outer products methodologies. We provide a convergence study of the algorithms for dictionary learning and dictionary-blind image reconstruction. Our numerical experiments show the promising performance and speed-ups provided by the proposed methods over previous schemes in sparse data representation and compressed sensing-based image reconstruction.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8098624","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCI.2017.2697206","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745852/8098624/07907280.pdf","startPage":"694","endPage":"709","doi":"10.1109/TCI.2017.2697206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Sum of Outer Products Dictionary Learning (SOUP-DIL) and Its Application to Inverse Problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Sum of Outer Products Dictionary Learning (SOUP-DIL) and Its Application to Inverse Problems","volume":"3","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7907280/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17352648","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2017","pubMedId":"29376111","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907280/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"ONR","grantNumber":"N00014-15-1-2141"},{"fundingName":"DARPA Young Faculty Award","grantNumber":"D14AP00086"},{"fundingName":"ARO MURI","grantNumber":"W911NF-11-1-0391 and 2015-05174-05"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"NIH","grantNumber":"U01 EB018753"},{"fundingName":"UM-SJTU Seed Grant"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Sum of Outer Products Dictionary Learning (SOUP-DIL) and Its Application to Inverse Problems","sourcePdf":"tci-ravishankar-2697206-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155183S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6745852","isNumber":"8098624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6745852","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8098624","articleId":"7907280","onlineDate":"21 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7907290,"authors":[{"name":"Yifan Wang","affiliation":["School of ITEE, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Yifan","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0001-7462-2679","id":"37540190000"},{"name":"Konstanty S.

Conventional systems make use of an overhead interrogator that reads a tag in a windscreen or a license plate. The alternative approach is to embed the interrogator in the road and exclusively read license plate tags. In this paper, the link budget of such a system is fully characterized assuming the ISO/IEC 18000-63 UHF Type-C RFID standard. The obtained results indicate that a microwave sensor that has an elevated toroidal radiation pattern at around a 20\u00b0-30\u00b0 elevation angle above the horizon is desired. This is a challenging task as road regulations dictate that the sensor cannot exceed a profile of 2.5 cm above the road surface. As an example of a sensor that meets those requirements, a modified discone antenna with an improved impedance matching method is presented. To reduce the antenna's profile and give the required mechanical strength to withstand the weight of different vehicles on the road, the area between the disc and the cone is filled with Acetal, which has a high dielectric constant. The proposed microwave sensor is fabricated and successfully tested in a real-road environment. The results confirm that the sensor meets the aforementioned strict requirements from the link budget analysis.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2017.2690679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8239722","startPage":"123","endPage":"128","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/8239722/07907290.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"In-Road Microwave Sensor for Electronic Vehicle Identification and Tracking: Link Budget Analysis and Antenna Prototype","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907290/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7907290/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"In-Road Microwave Sensor for Electronic Vehicle Identification and Tracking: Link Budget Analysis and Antenna Prototype","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17482736","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In-Road Microwave Sensor for Electronic Vehicle Identification and Tracking: Link Budget Analysis and Antenna Prototype","sourcePdf":"tits-wang-2690679-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073033S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"8239722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8239722","articleId":"7907290","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7907293,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Jun Zhou","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Nantong University, Nantong, China"],"firstName":"Wen-Jun","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086016381"},{"name":"Hui Tang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Nantong University, Nantong, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Tang","id":"37533617500"},{"name":"Jian-Xin Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Nantong University, Nantong, China"],"firstName":"Jian-Xin","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0002-8703-5294","id":"37280669500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"7907293","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":850},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7907293","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonant frequency","Electron tubes","Passband","Tuning","Band-pass filters","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","electric fields","microfluidics","microstrip filters","microstrip resonators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microfluidically tunable differential dual-mode patch filter","microfluidcally tunable differential bandpass filter","microfluidcally tunable differential BPF","frequency tunability","microfluidic channels","high dielectric constant fluid","dual-mode patch resonator","ground plane","E-field distributions","channel spaces","channel orientations","water filling sequence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Differential patch filter","microfluidic","precisely controlled passband","tunable bandpass filter (BPF)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2017.2690874","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7260/7921541/07907293.pdf","startPage":"461","endPage":"463","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2017.2690874","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7921541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Microfluidically Tunable Differential Dual-Mode Patch Filter","abstract":"This letter presents a novel microfluidcally tunable differential bandpass filter (BPF) with precisely controlled passband frequency.

Meanwhile, the frequency-tuning capability of the channels highly depends on the E-field distributions of the two modes on the patch. By properly choosing the orientations and spaces of the channels, the two-mode resonant frequencies can be simultaneously shifted up/down, and thus the frequency tuning states of the differential-mode passband can be precisely controlled with proper water-filling sequence.

In this paper, we study the distributed fusion estimation problem for networked time-varying systems with bounded noises, where the resource constraints (i.e., bandwidth or energy) and quantization effect are described by a unified model. A new local estimator with time-varying gain is designed by solving a class of convex optimization problems such that the square error of the estimator is bounded. When each local estimate is transmitted to the fusion center over communication networks, the selection probability criterion is derived such that the mean square error of the each compensating state estimate is bounded. Then, a convex optimization problem on the design of an optimal weighting fusion criterion is established in terms of linear matrix inequalities, which can be solved by standard software packages. Target tracking system with time-varying sampling period is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic

Two-Tone Radar Sensor for Concurrent Detection of Absolute Distance and Relative Movement for Gesture Sensing","abstract":"This letter presents a two-tone radar sensor system that can concurrently detect both absolute distance and relative movement. In contrast to the traditional two-tone radar, the proposed radar sensor can measure both distance and vibration. Moreover, it is more accurate in predicting the phase shift by leveraging the accuracy of nonlinear phase demodulation in the digital domain. Unlike the frequency-modulated continuous wave radar, the proposed radar system has simpler system architecture and does not require broadband signals. With a tone difference of 40MHz, the radar system can detect a distance up to 1.875m without ambiguity. Experiments show that the proposed radar system was able to not only capture the delaying movement of a Newton's cradle but to measure the distance with mm accuracy as well. It successfully detected the gesture motion of virtual slider, making it promising for sensing action gestures for human-computer interaction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907299/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","externalId":"3500504","publicationDate":"June 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7907299/","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16865659","volume":"1","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Two-Tone Radar Sensor for Concurrent Detection of Absolute Distance and Relative Movement for Gesture Sensing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Two-Tone Radar Sensor for Concurrent Detection of Absolute Distance and Relative Movement for Gesture Sensing","sourcePdf":"lsens-gu-2696520-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063139S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7782634","isNumber":"7919378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7782634","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7919378","articleId":"7907299","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7907301,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Kong","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/7896673/7907301/kong-2696786-small.gif","p":["Yu Kong (M\u201915) received the B.Eng. degree in automation from Anhui University in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the Beijing Institute of Technology, China, in 2012.

The key to this problem is to learn discriminative view-invariant features robust to view variations. In this paper, we address this problem by learning view-specific and view-shared features using novel deep models. View-specific features capture unique dynamics of each view while view-shared features encode common patterns across views. A novel sample-affinity matrix is introduced in learning shared features, which accurately balances information transfer within the samples from multiple views and limits the transfer across samples. This allows us to learn more discriminative shared features robust to view variations. In addition, the incoherence between the two types of features is encouraged to reduce information redundancy and exploit discriminative information in them separately. The discriminative power of the learned features is further improved by encouraging features in the same categories to be geometrically closer. Robust view-invariant features are finally learned by stacking several layers of features. Experimental results on three multi-view data sets show that our approaches outperform the state-of-the-art approaches.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7896673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2017.2696786","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7896673/07907301.pdf","startPage":"3028","endPage":"3037","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2017.2696786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deeply Learned View-Invariant Features for Cross-View Action Recognition","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/83/7896673/7907301-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","displayDocTitle":"Deeply Learned View-Invariant Features for Cross-View Action Recognition","volume":"26","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7907301/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16841248","dateOfInsertion":"03 May 2017","pubMedId":"28436876","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907301/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF IIS","grantNumber":"1651902"},{"fundingName":"ONR Young Investigator","grantNumber":"N00014-14-1-0484"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"U.S. Army Research Office Young Investigator","grantNumber":"W911NF-14-1-0218"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Deeply Learned View-Invariant Features for Cross-View Action Recognition","sourcePdf":"tip-kong-2696786-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120331S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7896673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7896673","articleId":"7907301","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7907303,"authors":[{"name":"Gui-Song Xia","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering, Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7955031/7907303/xia-2685945-small.gif","p":["Gui-Song Xia (M\u201910\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering and the M.S. degree in signal processing from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2005 and 2007, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in image processing and computer vision from the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) Laboratoire Traitement et Communication de l\u2019Information, TELECOM ParisTech, Paris, France, in 2011.","In 2011, he was a Post-Doctoral Researcher with the Centre de Recherche en Mathmatiques de la Decision, CNRS, Paris-Dauphine University, Paris, for one and a half years.

In recent years, it has become an active task in the remote sensing area, and numerous algorithms have been proposed for this task, including many machine learning and data-driven approaches. However, the existing data sets for aerial scene classification, such as UC-Merced data set and WHU-RS19, contain relatively small sizes, and the results on them are already saturated. This largely limits the development of scene classification algorithms. This paper describes the Aerial Image data set (AID): a large-scale data set for aerial scene classification. The goal of AID is to advance the state of the arts in scene classification of remote sensing images. For creating AID, we collect and annotate more than 10000 aerial scene images. In addition, a comprehensive review of the existing aerial scene classification techniques as well as recent widely used deep learning methods is given. Finally, we provide a performance analysis of typical aerial scene classification and deep learning approaches on AID, which can be served as the baseline results on this benchmark.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907303/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","volume":"55","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"16965454","dateOfInsertion":"22 June 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7907303/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"AID: A Benchmark Data Set for Performance Evaluation of Aerial Scene Classification","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41501462 and 91338113"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AID: A Benchmark Data Set for Performance Evaluation of Aerial Scene Classification","sourcePdf":"tgrs-xia-2685945-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.204329S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7955031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"501","xplore-issue":"7955031","articleId":"7907303","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7907315,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Zhang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7973115/7907315/zhang-2695188-small.gif","p":["Yang Zhang (M\u201913) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2011.

Simultaneously, it is desirable for the new 3-D MIMO channel model to be a further expansion of already well developed 2-D MIMO channel models to allow easy implementation and facilitate possible $3^{rd}$ generation partnership project standardization. This paper first shows our recent outfield channel measurement campaigns in urban macrocell scenarios with a planar antenna array and a crown-shaped antenna array installed on the base station and the user sides, respectively. A comprehensive methodology from the statistical analysis perspective to characterize the 3-D MIMO channel, particularly, in the elevation domain, is then elaborated upon. The framework of the new approach coincides with mainstream parametric stochastic models. Moreover, it is observed that, by recalculating the statistics of the large scale parameters as well as their cross-correlation matrix to rectify existent non-positive definite problem, adding distance dependent elevation angular spread and introducing a mixture of Von Mises Fisher distributions to describe the interdependence between azimuth and elevation, the accuracy of current standardized 3-D channel models can be improved upon. Finally, numerical results verify the validity of our proposal.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-D MIMO Parametric Stochastic Channel Model for Urban Macrocell Scenario","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2695188","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7973115/07907315.pdf","startPage":"4246","endPage":"4260","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2695188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7973115","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7907315","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907315/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","displayDocTitle":"3-D MIMO Parametric Stochastic Channel Model for Urban Macrocell Scenario","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7907315/","dateOfInsertion":"11 July 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17026604","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401321, 91538105 and 61372067"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2015JQ6221 and 2015JQ6259"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2014CB340206"},{"fundingName":"Open Project of the State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks","grantNumber":"ISN16-01"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Fund of the National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory","grantNumber":"2015D01"},{"fundingName":"Scientific Research Plan Projects of Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education","grantNumber":"16JK1498"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"B08038"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-D MIMO Parametric Stochastic Channel Model for Urban Macrocell Scenario","sourcePdf":"twc-zhang-2695188-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100965S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7973115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7973115","articleId":"7907315","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7907319,"authors":[{"name":"Seongkwon Jeong","affiliation":["Department of ICMC Convergence Technology, Soongsil University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seongkwon","lastName":"Jeong","orcid":"0000-0002-4974-337X","id":"37085335011"},{"name":"Jaejin Lee","affiliation":["Department of ICMC Convergence Technology, Soongsil University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jaejin","lastName":"Lee","orcid":"0000-0001-7791-3308","id":"37441013700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"7907319","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":267},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7907319","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Product codes","Decoding","Bit error rate","Equalizers","Signal to noise ratio","Tunneling magnetoresistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intersymbol interference","magnetic recording","parity check codes","product codes","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inter-track interference","system performance","recording system","iterative channel detection scheme","low-density parity check","LDPC product code","BPMR performance","modified extrinsic information data","bit-patterned media","data growth","high-density storage systems","next-generation magnetic recording systems","information bit","magnetic island","across-track islands","intersymbol interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit-patterned media recording (BPMR)","burst error","low-density parity check (LDPC) code","product code"]}],"abstract":"Because of the explosion in data growth, the requirement for high-density storage systems has increased.

In this paper, an iterative channel detection scheme with a low-density parity check (LDPC) product code for which the extrinsic information between the soft output Viterbi algorithm and the LDPC product code is used for the BPMR is proposed.

Most conventional studies have focused on joint base station and user equipment (BS-TIE) analog beamforming with the objective of improving the average signal to noise ratio performance before the baseband equalization. In contrast, this paper aims to optimize the BS-TIE analog beamforming vectors in the sense of minimizing the mean square error of the baseband equalized signal. Considering practical implementation requirement, we combine the gradient descent (GD) method and the iterative antenna training (IAT) technique, and propose an iterative local GD (ILGD) algorithm.

However, their behavior, and therefore their reliability, is limited by technology intrinsic constraints. Standard CMOS reliability analyses do not take into account RRAM-related misbehaviors. Consequently, new and more thorough characterization approaches are needed. Even more important, as RRAM is proposed to become a key piece in aerospace solutions, new radiation and temperature analyses should also be considered in reliability-oriented methodologies. This work presents a solution that completely characterizes RRAM and CMOS hybrid circuits under the combined effects of both technology and environmental error sources. The analysis strategy is based on three pillars: the definition of suitable models, the application of user-defined metrics to measure both circuit reliability and performance, and the efficient definition of the design space. These concepts are used by a powerful simulation framework, achieving automatic characterization of RRAM-based circuits by simultaneously considering multiple error sources. As a case of study, a thorough analysis of an RRAM read driver, including RRAM lifetime, circuit temperature, CMOS and RRAM variability, and radiation-both accumulated dose and single particle impacts-highlights the proposed approach capabilities.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2017.2697311","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2017.2697311","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel7/7729/7927511/07907328.pdf","startPage":"514","endPage":"522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7927511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Design and Analysis of Reliable RRAM-CMOS Hybrid Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907328/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"On the Design and Analysis of Reliable RRAM-CMOS Hybrid Circuits","volume":"16","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2017","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"16880151","htmlLink":"/document/7907328/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006050","fundingName":"CICYT projects TOLERA","grantNumber":"TEC2012-31292"},{"fundingName":"TOLERA2","grantNumber":"TEC2015-65902"},{"fundingName":"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Design and Analysis of Reliable RRAM-CMOS Hybrid Circuits","sourcePdf":"tnano-garciaredondo-2697311-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077058S","chronDate":"May  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"7927511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7927511","articleId":"7907328","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7907337,"authors":[{"name":"Hung Khanh Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/8497118/7907337/nguye-2696903-small.gif","p":["Hung Khanh Nguyen received the B.S. degree from the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, Vietnam, in 2010, and the M.S. degree from the Department of Electronics and Radio Engineering, Kyung Hee University, South Korea, in 2012.

To overcome this challenge, microgrids have been advocated as a viable solution to reduce variability and uncertainty associated with renewable generation by rescheduling their energy generation and storage resources based on grid flexibility requirements. In this paper, we propose an incentive mechanism design to motivate microgrids to participate in the peak ramp minimization problem for the system. By offering reimbursement for each microgrid to deviate from the original optimal operation point, the ramping capability requirement to match supply demand can be significantly reduced. We model and analyze the economic interaction between the distribution system operator (DSO) and microgrids using the Nash bargaining theory. The Nash bargaining solution (NBS) can be obtained by solving the centralized social welfare maximization problem. However, due to the distributed topology of the power network as well as independent decision-making nature of microgrids, the centralized design is not suitable for practical implementation. Therefore, we propose two distributed algorithms to achieve the NBS using the alternating direction method of multipliers decomposition technique, which can execute in either synchronous fashion or asynchronous fashion. The simulation results demonstrate the convergence performance of the proposed distributed algorithms as well as the efficacy of our model in achieving benefits for both microgrids and the DSO.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2017.2696903","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2017.2696903","startPage":"5774","endPage":"5785","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/8497118/07907337.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8497118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incentive Mechanism Design for Integrated Microgrids in Peak Ramp Minimization Problem","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/5165411/8497118/7907337-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Incentive Mechanism Design for Integrated Microgrids in Peak Ramp Minimization Problem","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2018","volume":"9","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7907337/","accessionNumber":"18181493","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907337/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CMMI-1434789, CMMI-1434771, CNS-1702850, CNS-1646607, ECCS-1547201, CCF-1456921, CNS-1443917 and ECCS-1405121"},{"fundingName":"Electric Power Analytics Consortium"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Incentive Mechanism Design for Integrated Microgrids in Peak Ramp Minimization Problem","sourcePdf":"tsg-nguyen-2696903-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0873S","chronDate":"Nov.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8497118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8497118","articleId":"7907337","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7907339,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Luo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/8231802/7907339/luo-2696540-small.gif","p":["Xiao Luo received the B.Eng.

In this context, this paper proposes a hierarchical scheme to control the power of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) to mitigate unit ramp cycling (URC) operations. A general-form representation of the URC operation is proposed for the first time. At the top level of the hierarchical scheme, a system net load variation range (NLVR) is constructed first to capture the uncertainty in WP forecasts, and then the PEV power is scheduled to reshape the NLVR so as to minimize the URC operations that can be caused by the possible net load realizations in the NLVR. Based on updated WP forecasts, the middle-level dispatch model exempts overscheduled anti-URC regulation onus on PEVs to promote PEV charging. At the bottom level, a decentralized PEV charging control strategy is used to implement the PEV power dispatch instruction. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme can avert the URC operations effectively, while preserve most of the desired PEV charging energy. Simulation results also show that the proposed scheme is more capable of withstanding WP forecast errors compared with its deterministic version and a benchmark scheme.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8231802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2017.2696540","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/8231802/07907339.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"69","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2017.2696540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hierarchical Scheme for Utilizing Plug-In Electric Vehicle Power to Hedge Against Wind-Induced Unit Ramp Cycling Operations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"A Hierarchical Scheme for Utilizing Plug-In Electric Vehicle Power to Hedge Against Wind-Induced Unit Ramp Cycling Operations","volume":"33","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7907339/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17482048","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907339/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hierarchical Scheme for Utilizing Plug-In Electric Vehicle Power to Hedge Against Wind-Induced Unit Ramp Cycling Operations","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-chan-2696540-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084711S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"8231802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8231802","articleId":"7907339","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7907341,"authors":[{"name":"Jungyup Jang","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology and Media Engineering, Seoul National University of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7944743/7907341/jang-2691779-small.gif","p":["Jungyup Jang received the B.S. degree in electronics and IT media engineering from the Seoul National University of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea, in 2010, the M.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, in 2012, and the Ph.D. degree in information technology and media engineering from the Seoul National University of Science and Technology, in 2017.

The open-loop MIMO precoder technique has been adopted in next generation broadcasting systems, such as digital video broadcasting-next generation handheld (DVB-NGH) and advanced television systems committee (ATSC) 3.0 standards. Furthermore, in DVB-NGH and ATSC 3.0, cross-polarized antennas have been employed in order to overcome the insufficient antenna separation for co-polarized antennas, which can enhance the performance over high correlation and LOS conditions. In this paper, we analyze and evaluate the performance of the open-loop MIMO precoders with cross-polarized antennas over correlated channels with an LOS component. We first study the statistical property of the MIMO channel with cross-polarized antennas on the basis of the measurement-based channel model. Next, we derive pairwise error probability (PEP) of the SM with the open-loop MIMO precoder. Through the PEP derivation, we evaluate the performance of each open-loop MIMO precoder against the spatial correlations and LOS component with the effect of cross-polarized antennas. The simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the open-loop MIMO precoders over various channel conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7944743/07907341.pdf","startPage":"4094","endPage":"4105","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2691779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2691779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7944743","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7907341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Open-Loop MIMO Precoder With Cross-Polarized Antennas Over Correlated Channels With an LOS Component","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Correlation","Channel models","Antennas","Standards","Antenna measurements","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","MIMO communication","precoding","probability","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["open-loop MIMO precoder performance","cross polarized antennas","correlated channels","LOS component","open-loop multiple-input multiple-output","MIMO precoders","channel information","spatial multiplexing","SM","line-of-sight","next generation broadcasting systems","advanced television systems committee standards","ATSC","pairwise error probability","PEP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross-polarized antennas","line-of-sight (LOS)","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","open-loop MIMO precoder","spatial correlation","spatial multiplexing (SM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907341/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Open-Loop MIMO Precoder With Cross-Polarized Antennas Over Correlated Channels With an LOS Component","volume":"16","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7907341/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16961608","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ICT R&D program of MSIP/IITP","grantNumber":"[2016-0-00144]"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Open-Loop MIMO Precoder With Cross-Polarized Antennas Over Correlated Channels With an LOS Component","sourcePdf":"twc-kim-2691779-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107494S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7944743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7944743","articleId":"7907341","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7907345,"authors":[{"name":"Christoph H.

This topic has regained interest, due to the high penetration of new types of loads and the increased availability of measurements in extended power grids. In this paper, an aggregated load model based on measurement data is formulated for dynamic simulations of large power systems. The proposed model employs variable-order transfer functions, enabling the accurate simulation of complex load dynamics. A complete methodology for the automatic derivation of the minimum-required model order is proposed with the model parameters calculated via a robust multisignal identification procedure. For this purpose, the vector fitting method is introduced as a technique for measurement-based load modeling. Several simulations are performed using the NEPLAN software to investigate the accuracy and the generalization capabilities of the proposed model. The model performance is thoroughly compared with other conventional load models, also using measurements recorded on a laboratory-scale microgrid.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907347/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7907347/","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17482020","volume":"33","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Measurement-Based Dynamic Load Modeling Using the Vector Fitting Technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement-Based Dynamic Load Modeling Using the Vector Fitting Technique","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-papagiannis-2697004-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166928S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"8231802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8231802","articleId":"7907347","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7907350,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro M.

(SSA-NC) is a cooperative transmission strategy that, under some conditions such as full channel state information (CSI), provides maximum degrees of freedom (DoF) in two-way relay networks. However, obtaining full CSI for SSA-NC requires a significant amount of training and feedback overhead. This paper focuses on the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Y channel and explicitly considers the required training and feedback at the users and relay. We derive the optimum signaling overhead of this channel to maximize the effective sum-rate of the SSA-NC scheme. We further investigate an important question: under what conditions does the SSA-NC scheme have a better sum-rate performance compared to other popular schemes with lower complexity such as multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) and time division multiple access (TDMA)? Since different schemes require different amounts of training/feedback overhead, our result demonstrates how the channel coherence interval plays an important role in their relative performance. Specifically, the SSA-NC scheme outperforms the other schemes only when the coherence interval is sufficiently large. This result highlights the importance of properly taking the training and feedback overhead and channel coherence interval into account when designing the communication scheme for the MIMO Y channel.","doi":"10.1109/COMNETSAT.2016.7907407","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Communication, Networks and Satellite (COMNETSAT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Communication, Networks and Satellite (COMNETSAT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7894605/7907393/07907407.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"13","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMNETSAT.2016.7907407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7907393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Y channel with imperfect CSI: Impact of training and feedback overhead","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7907407","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907407/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Y channel with imperfect CSI: Impact of training and feedback overhead","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16824627","htmlLink":"/document/7907407/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Y channel with imperfect CSI: Impact of training and feedback overhead","confLoc":"Surabaya, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"09_A_COM02-1570298459.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055456S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7894605","isNumber":"7907393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7894605","xplore-issue":"7907393","articleId":"7907407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7907408,"authors":[{"name":"Khairunnisa Alfiyanti Suharja","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Telkom University, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Khairunnisa Alfiyanti","lastName":"Suharja","id":"37086111397"},{"name":"Rina Pudji Astuti","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Telkom University, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Rina Pudji","lastName":"Astuti","id":"38246106000"},{"name":"Linda Meylani","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Telkom University, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Linda","lastName":"Meylani","id":"37085679836"},{"name":"Arfianto Fahmi","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Telkom University, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Arfianto","lastName":"Fahmi","id":"38237427900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5446-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5447-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7907408","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading channels","Multicarrier code division multiple access","OFDM","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MC-CDMA performance system","transmission system","frequency selective fading","OFDM","spectral efficiency","inphase interleaver","quadrature interleaver","rotating signal constellation","rotated modulation systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MC-CDMA","Rotated Modulation","power efficiency","modulation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7907408","abstract":"The transmission system with high data rate and high mobility is needed.

For this purpose, a statistical millimeter wave (mmwave) MIMO channel simulator is carefully designed using state of the art channel models. At the mmwave frequencies, human/vehicular mobility around the mobile users may partially or completely block the communication link. This give rise to the consideration of new channel modeling parameter i.e. probability of a user to be in LOS dynamics. Higher line of sight (LOS) probabilities may increase the spatial correlation among the multiuser channels. Therefore, quantification of the spatial separation of users in different scenarios with distinct LOS probabilities is crucial and it is the subject of investigation of this paper. Additionally, the mutual orthogonality of channels by changing the number of base station (BS) antennas and inter antenna element distance (IED) have also been investigated. Analysis shows that LOS blockage of certain scenario has more impact at the degree of orthogonality among users as compared to the number of BS antennas and the spacing between the antenna elements.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Channel models","Correlation","MIMO","Laplace equations","Millimeter wave communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled

division multiplexing (OFDM) signals is adapted from communication system. It can provide an excellent orthogonality that is required by MIMO radar transmitter. Another privilege of using OFDM signal is the flexibility in subcarrier allocation when multiple MIMO radar user is considered. This paper analyzed about the comparison of radar detection accuracy, and resolution of four OFDM MIMO radar waveforms, i.e. Conventional OFDM-MIMO radar waveform, and three types of interleaved technique which are different in the way of allocating the subcarrier frequency when multi user scenario is concerned. Interleaved OFDM waveforms that will be compared here are the model introduced by Wiesbeck et al, Yoke et al, and random subcarrier interleaving. The transmitted OFDM signal is designed in such a way that the multiple transmitters will only radiate at the unique subcarriers. In this paper, MUSIC algorithm is used to obtain the target angle of arrival (AoA) information and virtual array is applied to improve radar ability in multi targets detection that usually limited by the number of receiver antennas. Radar performance comparison will be discussed in terms of the target range, velocity and the AoA resolution, including their accuracy and sidelobe levels.","doi":"10.1109/COMNETSAT.2016.7907416","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Communication, Networks and Satellite (COMNETSAT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Communication, Networks and Satellite (COMNETSAT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7894605/7907393/07907416.pdf","startPage":"53","endPage":"59","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMNETSAT.2016.7907416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7907393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO radar waveform design using interleaved-OFDM technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7907416","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907416/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO radar waveform design using interleaved-OFDM technique","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16824616","htmlLink":"/document/7907416/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO radar waveform design using interleaved-OFDM technique","confLoc":"Surabaya, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"09_A_COM11-1570309925.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045995S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7894605","isNumber":"7907393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7894605","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7907393","articleId":"7907416","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":7907417,"authors":[{"name":"Waqas Ahmad","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Waqas","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"37085438669"},{"name":"Geamel Alyami","affiliation":["Wireless Center of Excellence (WiCE) - Florida Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Geamel","lastName":"Alyami","id":"37085990362"},{"name":"Ivica Kostanic","affiliation":["Wireless Center of Excellence (WiCE) - Florida Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Ivica","lastName":"Kostanic","id":"37297914500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5446-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5447-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7907417","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7907417","abstract":"In the conventional multiuser MIMO systems, user selection and scheduling has previously been used as an effective way to increase the sum rate performance of the system. However, the recent concepts of the massive MIMO systems (at centimeter wavelength frequencies) have shown that with higher spatial resolution of antenna arrays different users in the dense scenarios can be spatially separated. This in turn significantly reduces the signal processing efforts required for multiuser selection algorithms. On the other hand, recent measurements at millimeter wave frequencies show that multipath components only arrive from few angular directions leading to high spatial correlation between the paths and co-located users. This paper focus at the investigation of spatial separation among the users at the millimeter wave frequencies with fully digital linear zero-forcing transmit precoding considering various channel propagation parameters. Our analysis results convincingly give a proof that multiuser selection algorithms are still important for millimeter wave communication systems. Results also show that increased number of antenna elements does not give a major benefit to sum rate improvements as compared to the selection of correct number of users to be selected/scheduled.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Precoding","Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Millimeter wave communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","correlation methods","linear codes","millimetre wave antenna arrays","millimetre wave propagation","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","precoding","telecommunication scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser separation","performance analysis","millimeter wave channels","multiuser MIMO systems","user selection","user scheduling","sum rate performance","spatial resolution","antenna arrays","signal processing","multipath components","spatial correlation","spatial separation","fully digital linear zero-forcing transmit precoding","channel propagation parameters","multiuser selection algorithms","millimeter wave communication systems","antenna elements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mmWave channel model","Multipath clusters","large scale multiuser MIMO","user separation"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7907393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMNETSAT.2016.7907417","startPage":"60","endPage":"64","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Communication, Networks and Satellite (COMNETSAT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Communication, Networks and Satellite (COMNETSAT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7894605/7907393/07907417.pdf","doi":"10.1109/COMNETSAT.2016.7907417","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser separation and performance analysis of millimeter wave channels with linear precoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multiuser separation and performance analysis of millimeter wave channels with linear precoding","accessionNumber":"16824625","publicationDate":"2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7907417/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907417/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser separation and performance analysis of millimeter wave channels with linear precoding","confLoc":"Surabaya, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"09_A_COM12-1570309963.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098906S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7894605","isNumber":"7907393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7894605","xplore-issue":"7907393","articleId":"7907417","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7907443,"authors":[{"name":"Archontis Giannakidis","affiliation":["NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital, London, UK","Imperial College London, National Heart & Lung Institute, London, UK"],"firstName":"Archontis","lastName":"Giannakidis","id":"37871640900"},{"name":"Konstantinos Kamnitsas","affiliation":["NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital, London, UK"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Kamnitsas","id":"37086056195"},{"name":"Veronica Spadotto","affiliation":["NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital, London, UK"],"firstName":"Veronica","lastName":"Spadotto","id":"37088728369"},{"name":"Jennifer Keegan","affiliation":["NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital, London, UK"],"firstName":"Jennifer","lastName":"Keegan","id":"37273031200"},{"name":"Gillian Smith","affiliation":["NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital, London, UK"],"firstName":"Gillian","lastName":"Smith","id":"37088722435"},{"name":"Ben Glocker","affiliation":["NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital, London, UK"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Glocker","id":"37898965700"},{"name":"Daniel Rueckert","affiliation":["NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital, London, UK"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Rueckert","id":"37272737900"},{"name":"Sabine Ernst","affiliation":["NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital, London, UK"],"firstName":"Sabine","lastName":"Ernst","id":"37085806011"},{"name":"Michael A.

The detailed knowledge of the right ventricular anatomy is critical in ToF management. The segmentation of the right ventricle (RV) in CMR images from ToF patients is a challenging task due to the high shape and image quality variability. In this paper we propose a fully automatic deep learning-based framework to segment the RV from CMR anatomical images of the whole heart. We adopt a 3D multi-scale deep convolutional neural network to identify pixels that belong to the RV. Our robust segmentation framework was tested on 26 ToF patients achieving a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.8281\u00b10.1010 with reference to manual annotations performed by expert cardiologists. The proposed technique is also computationally efficient, which may further facilitate its adoption in the clinical routine.","doi":"10.1109/SITIS.2016.16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SITIS.2016.16","publicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Signal-Image Technology & Internet-Based Systems (SITIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Signal-Image Technology & Internet-Based Systems (SITIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7906442/7907426/07907443.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"46","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7907426","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907443/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 28 2016-Dec. 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"Fast Fully Automatic Segmentation of the Severely Abnormal Human Right Ventricle from Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Images Using a Multi-Scale 3D Convolutional Neural Network","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Nov.-1 Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16837286","htmlLink":"/document/7907443/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Fully Automatic Segmentation of the Severely Abnormal Human Right Ventricle from Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Images Using a Multi-Scale 3D Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Naples, Italy","sourcePdf":"5698a042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126185S","chronDate":"Nov. 28 2016-Dec. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7906442","isNumber":"7907426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7906442","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7907426","articleId":"7907443","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7907447,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Calimeri","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Calabria, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Calimeri","id":"37085812353"},{"name":"Aldo Marzullo","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Calabria, Italy"],"firstName":"Aldo","lastName":"Marzullo","id":"37086072938"},{"name":"Claudio Stamile","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT), Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Stamile","id":"37085624536"},{"name":"Giorgio Terracina","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Calabria, Italy"],"firstName":"Giorgio","lastName":"Terracina","id":"37282816800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5698-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5699-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7907447","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":277},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Retina","Optical imaging","Biomedical optical imaging","Neural networks","Optical computing","Optical fiber networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","medical image processing","neural nets","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optic disc detection","fine tuned convolutional neural networks","OD","retinal fundus image analysis","information extraction","pathologies prevention","CNN","DRIVE database","STARE database","DRIONS database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fundus Image","Optic Disc Detection","Convolutional Neural Networks","Transfer Learning","Fine Tuning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7907447","abstract":"The detection of the Optic Disc (OD) is an significant step in retinal fundus images analysis, it allows to extract relevant information that proved to be useful for the prevention of several pathologies, such as glaucoma, hypertension, diabetes and other cardiovascular diseases, which manifest their effects in the retina.

The features are extracted from the received signal that is considered in the time, frequency and wavelet domains. Also, to overcome the multiclass problem, a hierarchical structure is investigated based on binary support vector machine (SVM). The simulations demonstrate superior capabilities of the proposed features in accurately separating digitally modulated signals in an extremely noisy environment with very low SNR values.

Research on spoofing (or liveness) detection is therefore very active. A number of methods have been proposed in the literature, sometimes with very promising results, but limited robustness with respect to the large variety of biometric traits, sensors, and attacks encountered in real-life. Recently, methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are drawing great attention, given their success in many other image processing tasks. However, despite some promising results, they seem to suffer the same robustness problem, requiring heavy training to work properly. Here, we propose a new CNN architecture for biometric spoofing detection. Thanks to domain-specific knowledge, accounted for through a suitable loss function, a compact architecture is obtained, allowing reliable training also in the presence of small-size datasets. Experiments prove the proposal to provide state-of-art performance on several widespread datasets for face and iris liveness detection.","doi":"10.1109/SITIS.2016.38","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SITIS.2016.38","publicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Signal-Image Technology & Internet-Based Systems (SITIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Signal-Image Technology & Internet-Based Systems (SITIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7906442/7907426/07907465.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7907426","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907465/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 28 2016-Dec. 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"Biometric Spoofing Detection by a Domain-Aware Convolutional Neural Network","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Nov.-1 Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16837242","htmlLink":"/document/7907465/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biometric Spoofing Detection by a Domain-Aware Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Naples, Italy","sourcePdf":"5698a193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069728S","chronDate":"Nov. 28 2016-Dec. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7906442","isNumber":"7907426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7906442","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7907426","articleId":"7907465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7907483,"authors":[{"name":"Michalis Papakostas","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Texas, Arlington, USA"],"firstName":"Michalis","lastName":"Papakostas","id":"37085672428"},{"name":"Theodoros Giannakopoulos","affiliation":["Institute of Informatics & Telecommunications, National Center for Scientific Research Demokritos, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Theodoros","lastName":"Giannakopoulos","id":"37418352400"},{"name":"Fillia Makedon","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Texas, Arlington, USA"],"firstName":"Fillia","lastName":"Makedon","id":"37271700100"},{"name":"Vangelis Karkaletsis","affiliation":["Institute of Informatics & Telecommunications, National Center for Scientific Research Demokritos, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Vangelis","lastName":"Karkaletsis","id":"37442569200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5698-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5699-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7907483","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":274},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Legged locomotion","Monitoring","Training","Feature extraction","Activity recognition","Videos","Robot sensing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["assisted living","image classification","image colour analysis","image motion analysis","image recognition","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human activity short-term recognition","deep learning classification","frame-wise recognition","raw color information","RGB","convolutional neural network classification","CNN classifiers","motion activity classes","home monitoring environment","assisted living home environment","shallow classifiers","hand-crafted features"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["activity recognition","ADLs","deep learning","health monitoring"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a deep learning classification method for frame-wise recognition of human activities, using raw color (RGB) information.

In this work, we propose a novel approach to address the subtle problem of selfie detection for image database segregation on the web, given rapid rise in the number of selfies being clicked. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is modeled to learn a synergy feature in the common subspace of head and shoulder orientation, derived from Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features respectively. This synergy was captured by projecting the aforementioned features using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). We show that the resulting network's convolutional activations in the neighbourhood of spatial keypoints captured by SIFT are discriminative for selfie-detection. In general, proposed approach aids in capturing intricacies present in the image data and has the potential for usage in other subtle image analysis scenarios apart from just selfie detection. We investigate and analyse the performance of the popular CNN architectures (GoogleNet, Alexnet), used for other image classification tasks, when subjected to the task of detecting the selfies on the multimedia platform. The results of the proposed approach are compared with these popular architectures on a dataset of ninety thousand images comprising of roughly equal number of selfies and non-selfies. Experimental results on this dataset shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/SITIS.2016.61","startPage":"335","endPage":"342","publicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Signal-Image Technology & Internet-Based Systems (SITIS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SITIS.2016.61","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7907426","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Signal-Image Technology & Internet-Based Systems (SITIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7906442/7907426/07907488.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selfie Detection by Synergy-Constraint Based Convolutional Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907488/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Selfie Detection by Synergy-Constraint Based Convolutional Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7907488/","accessionNumber":"16837275","publicationDate":"2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","conferenceDate":"28 Nov.-1 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 28 2016-Dec. 1 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selfie Detection by Synergy-Constraint Based Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Naples, Italy","sourcePdf":"5698a335.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077441S","chronDate":"Nov. 28 2016-Dec. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7906442","isNumber":"7907426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7906442","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7907426","articleId":"7907488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7907544,"authors":[{"name":"Livia Marcellino","affiliation":["Dept. of Science and Technology, University of Naples Parthenope, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Livia","lastName":"Marcellino","id":"37085466125"},{"name":"Guglielmo Navarra","affiliation":["Dept. of Science and Technology, University of Naples Parthenope, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Guglielmo","lastName":"Navarra","id":"37086069362"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5698-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5699-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7907544","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":198},"abstract":"In this work, we present a parallel implementation of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) using CUDA programming model. Our approach is based on an iterative parallel version of the QR factorization by means Givens plane rotations using the Sameh and Kuck scheme. The parallel algorithm is driven by an outer loop executed on the CPU. Therefore, threads and blocks configuration is organized in order to use the shared memory and avoid multiple accesses to global memory. However, the main kernel provides coalesced accesses to global memory using contiguous indices. As case study, we consider the application of the SVD in the Overcomplete Local Principal Component Analysis (OLPCA) algorithm for the Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) denoising process. Our results show significant improvements in terms of performances with respect to the CPU version that encourage its usability for this expensive application.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th

fruit of recent developments in information technology, it provides access to many online services as well as remote computing resources as needed. To be more specific, cloud computing stands today as a satisfactory answer to the problem of storage and computing of data encountered by companies. It provides treatment and accommodation of their digital information via a fully outsourced infrastructure. The latter enables users to benefit from many online services without worrying about the technical aspects of their use. In the meanwhile, it limits costs generated by the management of these data. However, this advanced technology has immediately highlighted many serious security troubles. The major issue that prevents many companies to migrate to the cloud is the security of sensitive data hosted in the provider. Actually, the security problem related to this technology has slowed their expansion and restricted in a severe way their scope. The work in this paper deals to present a literature review of data security approaches for cloud computing, and evaluates them in terms of how well they support critical security services and what level of adaptation they achieve.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7907552/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 28 2016-Dec. 1 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16837296","htmlLink":"/document/7907552/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","conferenceDate":"28 Nov.-1 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Security Issues in Cloud Computing and Associated Alleviation Approaches","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security Issues in Cloud Computing and Associated Alleviation Approaches","confLoc":"Naples, Italy","sourcePdf":"5698a758.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080146S","chronDate":"Nov. 28 2016-Dec. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7906442","isNumber":"7907426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7906442","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7907426","articleId":"7907552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7907557,"authors":[{"name":"Ilyass Abouelaziz","affiliation":["LRIT, Mohamed V University in Rabat, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Ilyass","lastName":"Abouelaziz","id":"37085345859"},{"name":"Mohammed El Hassouni","affiliation":["DESTEC, FLSHR, Mohammed V University in Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"El Hassouni","id":"37320413000"},{"name":"Hocine Cherifi","affiliation":["3 LE2I UMR 6306 CNRS, University of Burgundy, Dijon, France"],"firstName":"Hocine","lastName":"Cherifi","id":"37323055700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5698-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5699-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7907557","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Feature extraction","Measurement","Databases","Three-dimensional displays","Quality assessment","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational geometry","learning (artificial intelligence)","mesh generation","neural nets","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["curvature based method","blind mesh visual quality assessment","no-reference quality assessment","computational method","human perceived quality prediction","distorted mesh","GRNN","mean curvature","perceptual feature","visual aspect representation","3D mesh","human subjective scores","general regression neural network training","visual quality","subject scores","competitive scores"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind mesh visual quality assessment","general regression neural network","mean curvature","mean opinion scores","predicted objective scores","feature learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7907557","abstract":"No-reference quality assessment is a challenging issue due to the non-existence of any information related to the reference and the unknown distortion type.

The objective is to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) under the constraints on per-antenna transmit power and proportional data rates among users. Since EE function is typically defined in fractional form, it is computationally complex to optimize the EE directly. We first convert the nonlinear fractional problem into an equivalent but better tractable problem, based on which we derive an iterative algorithm to obtain the global optimum of the considered problem. On top of being optimal, the solution is also lightweight since only a single-variable nonlinear equation needs to be solved. Furthermore, we can flexibly switch to another mode of operation which delivers relatively higher spectral efficiency (SE) at the expense of losing EE. Numerical simulations and complexity analysis validate that the proposed scheme achieves much higher SE and EE performance with stricter satisfaction of the proportional rate constraints and lower complexity, compared to the state-of-the-art scheme in literature.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Power Allocation for Distributed Antenna Systems With Proportional Fairness","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking","doi":"10.1109/TGCN.2017.2697452","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/7511293/7930359/07908934.pdf","startPage":"145","endPage":"157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGCN.2017.2697452","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7930359","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7908934","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7908934/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Power Allocation for Distributed Antenna Systems With Proportional Fairness","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7908934/","dateOfInsertion":"17 May 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16885168","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"MIMOS Berhad"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Power Allocation for Distributed Antenna Systems With Proportional Fairness","sourcePdf":"tgcn-tham-2697452-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115439S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7511293","isNumber":"7930359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7511293","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7930359","articleId":"7908934","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7908936,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7973115/7908936/wang-2696000-small.gif","p":["Wei Wang (S\u201908\u2013M\u201910\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, in 2004 and 2009, respectively.

In this paper, we consider the delay-aware fronthaul allocation problem for C-RANs. The stochastic optimization problem is formulated as an infinite horizon average cost Markov decision process. To deal with the curse of dimensionality, we derive a closed-form approximate priority function and the associated error bound using perturbation analysis. Based on the closed-form approximate priority function, we propose a low-complexity delay-aware fronthaul allocation algorithm solving the per-stage optimization problem. The proposed solution is further shown to be asymptotically optimal for sufficiently small residual interference. Finally, the proposed fronthaul allocation algorithm is compared with various baselines through simulations, and it is shown that significant performance gain can be achieved.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7973115/07908936.pdf","startPage":"4275","endPage":"4287","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2696000","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2696000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7973115","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7908936","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay-Aware Uplink Fronthaul Allocation in Cloud Radio Access Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Uplink","Delays","Wireless communication","Quantization (signal)","Optimization","Baseband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes","optimisation","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay-aware uplink fronthaul allocation problem","cloud radio access networks","stochastic optimization problem","infinite horizon average cost Markov decision process","closed-form approximate priority function","perturbation analysis","per-stage optimization problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud radio access networks","fronthaul link","delay optimization","perturbation analysis","Markov decision process"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7908936/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Delay-Aware Uplink Fronthaul Allocation in Cloud Radio Access Networks","volume":"16","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7908936/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17026582","dateOfInsertion":"11 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571396 and 61361166005"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"LR17F010001"},{"fundingName":"Research Grants Council of Hong Kong","grantNumber":"N_HKUST605/13"},{"fundingName":"Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by CAST and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2015XZZX001-03"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay-Aware Uplink Fronthaul Allocation in Cloud Radio Access Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-wang-2696000-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0828S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7973115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7973115","articleId":"7908936","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7908937,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph Connelly","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California at San Diego, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Joseph Connelly (S\u201912) was born in Milwaukee in 1991.

We consider the more general setting of linear coding for directed acyclic networks with finite commutative ring alphabets. Our results imply that for scalar linear network coding over commutative rings, fields can always be used when the alphabet size is flexible, but other rings may be needed when the alphabet size is fixed. We prove that if a network has a scalar linear solution over some finite commutative ring, then the (unique) smallest such commutative ring is a field. We also show that fixed-size commutative rings are quasi-ordered, such that all the scalar linearly solvable networks over any given ring are also scalar linearly solvable over any higher-ordered ring. We study commutative rings that are maximal with respect to this quasiorder, as they may be considered the best commutative rings of a given size. We prove that a commutative ring is maximal if and only if some network is scalar linearly solvable over the ring, but not over any other commutative ring of the same size. Furthermore, we show that maximal commutative rings are direct products of certain fields specified by the integer partitions of the prime factor multiplicities of the ring's size. Finally, we prove that there is a unique maximal commutative ring of size m if and only if each prime factor of m has multiplicity in {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}. As consequences, 1) every finite field is such a maximal ring and 2) for each prime p, some network is scalar linearly solvable over a commutative ring of size pk but not over the field of the same size if and only if k \u2209 {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2017.2697421","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/8232491/07908937.pdf","startPage":"274","endPage":"291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2017.2697421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8232491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear Network Coding Over Rings \u2013 Part I: Scalar Codes and Commutative Alphabets","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/18/8232491/7908937-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7908937/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Linear Network Coding Over Rings \u2013 Part I: Scalar Codes and Commutative Alphabets","volume":"64","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17447793","htmlLink":"/document/7908937/","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Linear Network Coding Over Rings \u2013 Part I: Scalar Codes and Commutative Alphabets","sourcePdf":"tit-zeger-2697421-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.169971S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"8232491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8232491","articleId":"7908937","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7908940,"authors":[{"name":"Zheda Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7973115/7908940/li-2696010-small.gif","p":["Zheda Li received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2010, and the M.S. degree (Hons.) in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California (USC), Los Angeles, CA, USA, in 2012, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the WiDeS Group, USC, led by Prof. A.

A tracking error system with measurable output is first derived from the output tracking problem, and unmeasured states are observed by an universal fuzzy state observer (UFSO), whereby adaptive fuzzy approximators and an universal adaptive gain are employed to estimate unknown dynamics and dominant unknown residuals, respectively. In conjunction with the rescaled UFSO and observation errors, the UAFC using output tracking error feedback is explicitly constructed, in a recursive manner, by employing the command filtered backstepping technique, whereby intermediate virtual signals and their first derivatives associated with complex dynamics can be reconstructed by second-order filters. Furthermore, adaptive mechanisms for fuzzy approximators and the universal gain pertaining to the UFSO and UAFC are derived from the Lyapunov synthesis. Theoretical analysis proves that all signals of the closed-loop system are bounded and the output tracking error and observation error can converge to an arbitrarily small region determined by a prescribed accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed UAFC scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking-Error-Based Universal Adaptive Fuzzy Control for Output Tracking of Nonlinear Systems with Completely Unknown Dynamics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2017.2697399","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/8327949/07908943.pdf","startPage":"869","endPage":"883","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2017.2697399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8327949","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7908943","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7908943/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","displayDocTitle":"Tracking-Error-Based Universal Adaptive Fuzzy Control for Output Tracking of Nonlinear Systems with Completely Unknown Dynamics","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7908943/","dateOfInsertion":"29 March 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17683436","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51009017 and 51379002"},{"fundingName":"Dalian Distinguished Young Scholars","grantNumber":"2016RJ10"},{"fundingName":"Plan for Dalian High-level Talents","grantNumber":"2015R065"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"3132016314"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking-Error-Based Universal Adaptive Fuzzy Control for Output Tracking of Nonlinear Systems with Completely Unknown Dynamics","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-wang-2697399-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141275S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"8327949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"8327949","articleId":"7908943","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7908945,"authors":[{"name":"Ramin Moghaddass","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ramin Moghaddass received the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada, in 2008.

The proposal of hierarchical ELM (H-ELM) extends ELM from single hidden layer feedforward networks to multilayer perceptron, greatly strengthening the applicability of ELM. Generally speaking, during training H-ELM, large-scale datasets (DSTs) are needed. Therefore, how to make use of H-ELM framework in processing big data is worth further exploration. This paper proposes a parallel H-ELM algorithm based on Flink, which is one of the in-memory cluster computing platforms, and graphics processing units (GPUs). Several optimizations are adopted to improve the performance, such as cache-based scheme, reasonable partitioning strategy, memory mapping scheme for mapping specific Java virtual machine objects to buffers. Most importantly, our proposed framework for utilizing GPUs to accelerate Flink for big data is general. This framework can be utilized to accelerate many other variants of ELM and other machine learning algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first kind of library, which combines in-memory cluster computing with GPUs to parallelize H-ELM.

For the electrical interface with a biological system, high-precision high-speed data recording and various types of stimulation capability are required. In addition, real-time signal processing is an important feature in the implementation of a real-time closed-loop system without unwanted substantial delay for feedback stimulation. Online spike sorting, the process of assigning neural spikes to an identified group of neurons or clusters, is a necessary step to make a closed-loop path in real time, but massive memory-space requirements commonly limit hardware implementations. Here, we present a 128-channel field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based real-time closed-loop bidirectional neural interface system. The system supports 128 channels for simultaneous signal recording and eight selectable channels for stimulation. A modular 64-channel analog front-end (AFE) provides scalability and a parameterized specification of the AFE supports the recording of various electrophysiological signal types with 1.59 \u00b1 0.76 $\\mu {V}$ root-mean-square noise. The stimulator supports both voltage-controlled and current-controlled arbitrarily shaped waveforms with the programmable amplitude and duration of pulse. An empirical algorithm for online real-time spike sorting is implemented in an FPGA. The spike-sorting is performed by template matching, and templates are created by an online real-time unsupervised learning process. A memory saving technique, called dynamic cache organizing, is proposed to reduce the memory requirement down to 6 kbit per channel and modular implementation improves the scalability for further extensions.","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2017.2697415","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7333/8168802/07908970.pdf","startPage":"2227","endPage":"2238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2017.2697415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8168802","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7908970","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 128-Channel FPGA-Based Real-Time Spike-Sorting Bidirectional Closed-Loop Neural Interface System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7908970/","displayDocTitle":"A 128-Channel FPGA-Based Real-Time Spike-Sorting Bidirectional Closed-Loop Neural Interface System","volume":"25","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7908970/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17397789","pubMedId":"28459692","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Pioneer Research Center Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea Funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning","grantNumber":"2012-0009464"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003696","fundingName":"Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute","grantNumber":"16ZH1210"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 128-Channel FPGA-Based Real-Time Spike-Sorting Bidirectional Closed-Loop Neural Interface System","sourcePdf":"tnsre-park-2697415-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110249S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"8168802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8168802","articleId":"7908970","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7908973,"authors":[{"name":"Mostafa Ahmed Mohamed Sayed","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Mostafa Ahmed Mohamed","lastName":"Sayed","orcid":"0000-0002-2825-8922","id":"37086102041"},{"name":"Rongke Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rongke","lastName":"Liu","id":"37289647500"},{"name":"Chenyu Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chenyu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086140888"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7908973","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":664},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Mutual information","Signal to noise ratio","Security","Resists","Receivers","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","channel coding","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scrambler design","secrecy transmission","physical layer security","polar coding secrecy","scrambling module","preassigned key","algorithm diffusion power","bit channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wiretap channel","polar coding system","new scrambling module","configurable secrecy rate","low complexity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7908973","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8007375/07908973.pdf","startPage":"1679","endPage":"1682","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2697427","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2697427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8007375","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Scrambler Design for Enhancing Secrecy Transmission Based On Polar Code","abstract":"Scrambling is a way of enhancing physical layer security presented in many papers.

The presented scrambling module combines linear and nonlinear structure. The presented linear structure increases the branch number in a low-complexity way to enhance algorithm diffusion power, and the nonlinear part can resist the differential attack and reduces the mutual information between its input and output. With the proposed module, the bit channels, which are good for Bob and Eve, can also be applied to transmit secret message, making transmission rate of the secret massage configurable.

In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a new approach to develop cheap-to-evaluate multiobjective EI criteria based on the proposed EI matrix (EIM). The elements in the EIM are the single-objective EIs that the studying point has beyond each Pareto front approximation point in each objective. Three multiobjective criteria are developed by combining the elements in the EIM into scalar functions in three different ways. These proposed multiobjective criteria are calculated using only 1-D integrations, whose number increases linearly with respect to the number of objectives. Moreover, all the three criteria are derived in closed form expressions, thus are significantly cheaper to evaluate than the state-of-the-art multiobjective criteria. The efficiencies of the proposed criteria are validated through 12 test problems. Besides the computational advantage, the proposed multiobjective EI criteria also show competitive abilities in approximating the Pareto fronts of the chosen test problems compared against the state-of-the-art multiobjective EI criteria.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/4235/8124132/07908974.pdf","startPage":"956","endPage":"975","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Expected Improvement Matrix-Based Infill Criteria for Expensive Multiobjective Optimization","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2017.2697503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8124132","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2017.2697503","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7908974","supplementGroup":[{"repository":"code-ocean","type":"algorithm","badge":"Available","badgeMsg":"This document includes code submitted by the author.","supplement":[{"doi":"10.24433/CO.1992544.v1","uri":"https://codeocean.com/2918750","name":"Expected Improvement Matrix-Based Infill Criteria for Expensive Multiobjective Optimization (Matlab code)","language":"MATLAB","widgetUrl":"https://codeocean.com/widget.js?id=384bcf18-80b0-4cc0-84d5-76f2109c3ff1","badgeType":"Code-Available"}]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7908974/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Expected Improvement Matrix-Based Infill Criteria for Expensive Multiobjective Optimization","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17377824","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"21","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7908974/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Expected Improvement Matrix-Based Infill Criteria for Expensive Multiobjective Optimization","sourcePdf":"tevc-liu-2697503-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.228392S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"8124132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8124132","articleId":"7908974","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7908989,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Hu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Xiamen University, Fujian, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Hu","id":"37086172948"},{"name":"Lin Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Xiamen University, Fujian, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-6698-129X","id":"37086173345"},{"name":"Georges Kaddoum","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Quebec, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Georges","lastName":"Kaddoum","id":"37398102200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7908989","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":415},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7908989","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Chaos","Transmitting antennas","Communication systems","Encoding","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaotic communication","error statistics","MIMO communication","modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differentially spatial modulated chaos shift keying modulation system","modulation communication system","channel state information","differential matrix","spatial modulation","multiple-input multiple-output differential chaos shift keying system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spatial modulation","channel state information","differential detector","chaos modulation"]}],"abstract":"In this brief, a new differentially spatial modulated chaos shift keying modulation communication system is proposed, in which the transceiver has not accessed channel state information.

In this system, two nodes A and B communicate with each other via a relay R. Nodes A and B send complex symbols, wA and wB, simultaneously to relay R. Based on the simultaneously received signals, relay R computes a linear combination of the symbols, w\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</sub>\n = \u03b1w\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">A</sub>\n + \u03b2w\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">B</sub>\n, as a network-coded symbol and then broadcasts wN to nodes A and B.

Node B obtains wB in a similar way. A critical question at relay R is as follows: \u201cgiven channel gain ratio \u03b7 = hA/hB, where hA and hB are the complex channel gains from nodes A and B to relay R, respectively, what is the optimal coefficients (\u03b1, \u03b2) that minimizes the symbol error rate (SER) of wN = \u03b1w\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">A</sub>\n + \u03b2w\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">B</sub>\n when the relay attempts to detect wN in the presence of noise?\u201d Our contributions with respect to this question are as follows: 1) we put forth a general Gaussian-integer formulation for complex linear PNC in which \u03b1, \u03b2, w\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">A</sub>\n, w\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">B</sub>\n, and w\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</sub>\n are the elements of a finite field of Gaussian integers, that is, the field of 7G[i]/q, where q is a Gaussian prime. Previous vector formulation, in which wA, wB, and wN were represented by 2-D vectors and \u03b1 and \u03b2 were represented by 2 x 2 matrices, corresponds to a subcase of our Gaussian-integer formulation, where q is real prime only. Extension to the Gaussian prime q, where q can be complex, gives us a larger set of signal constellations to achieve different rates at different values of SNR; and 2) we show how to divide the complex plane of \u03b7 into different Voronoi regions, such that the \u03b7 within each Voronoi region shares the same optimal PNC mapping (\u03b1\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">opt</sub>\n, \u03b2\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">opt</sub>\n).

We present a noise-robust phase-change implementation of a neuron and a synaptic learning rule that is capable of capturing patterns of weakly correlated inputs. We experimentally demonstrate the operation with a correlation coefficient as low as 0.2 using a record number of 1M phase-change synapses.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2017.2697457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8091143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2017.2697457","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8091143/07908997.pdf","startPage":"1342","endPage":"1346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neuromorphic Architecture With 1M Memristive Synapses for Detection of Weakly Correlated Inputs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Neuromorphic Architecture With 1M Memristive Synapses for Detection of Weakly Correlated Inputs","volume":"64","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7908997/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17372437","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7908997/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001703","fundingName":"\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004316","fundingName":"International Business Machines Corporation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neuromorphic Architecture With 1M Memristive Synapses for Detection of Weakly Correlated Inputs","sourcePdf":"tcsii-wozniak-2697457-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074482S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8091143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8091143","articleId":"7908997","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7909000,"authors":[{"name":"Mi-Young Nam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Mi-Young","lastName":"Nam","id":"37647557200"},{"name":"Hong-Yeop Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hong-Yeop","lastName":"Song","orcid":"0000-0001-8764-9424","id":"37270117100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7909000","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":377},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maintenance engineering","Upper bound","Optimized production technology","Decision support systems","Reliability","Linear codes","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary locally repairable codes","partial t-spreads","LRCs","upper bound","minimum distance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Locally repairable codes","parity-check matrix","partial t-spreads"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7909000","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8007375/07909000.pdf","startPage":"1683","endPage":"1686","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2697424","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2697424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8007375","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Binary Locally Repairable Codes With Minimum Distance at Least Six Based on Partial $t$ -Spreads","abstract":"We propose a new construction for binary locally repairable codes (LRCs) based on a (partial) t-spread, which constructs an LRC with minimum distance d \u2265 6 and any locality r \u2265 2.

The SNs send their 1-bit test statistics over orthogonal channels to the fusion center (FC), which linearly combines them to reach to a final decision. Adopting the modified deflection coefficient as an alternative function to be optimized, we first derive in a closed-form the FC optimal weights combining. But as these optimal weights require a priori knowledge that cannot be attained in practice, this optimal weighted linearFC rule is not implementable. We also derive in a closed-form the expressions for the attacker \u201cflipping probability\u201d (defined in paper) and the minimum fraction of compromised SNs that makes the FC incapable of detecting. Next, based on the insights gained from these expressions, we propose a novel and noncomplex reliability-based strategy to identify the compromised SNs, and then, adapt the weights combining proportional to their assigned reliability metric. In this way, the FC identifies the compromised SNs and decreases their weights in order to reduce their contributions towards its final decision. Finally, simulation results illustrate that the proposed strategy significantly outperforms (in terms of FC's detection capability) the existing compromised SNs identification and mitigation schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7909003/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","volume":"4","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"17737251","publicationDate":"June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7909003/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2018","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Secure Optimum Distributed Detection Scheme in Under-Attack Wireless Sensor Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/N03435X/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Secure Optimum Distributed Detection Scheme in Under-Attack Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tsipn-nurellari-2697724-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119197S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6884276","isNumber":"8350883","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6884276","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8350883","articleId":"7909003","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7909009,"authors":[{"name":"Jinghua Jiang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China","Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4629386/9114375/7909009/jiang-2697385-small.gif","p":["Jinghua Jiang received the BE degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2010.

In order to maximize revenue, ads are recommended to be delivered to potentially interested users, which requires user targeting, i.e., analyzing users' profiles and exploring users' interests. However, collecting user personal information for targeted mobile advertising services raises critical privacy concerns. Although some solutions like anonymization and obfuscation have been proposed for privacy-aware targeted advertising, they undesirably face the issues of security, efficiency, and/or ad relevance. In this paper, we propose a practical system enabling secure and efficient targeted mobile advertising services. It allows the ad network to perform accurate user targeting, while ensuring strong privacy protection for mobile users. Specifically, we show how to properly leverage a cryptographic primitive called private stream searching to support secure, accurate, and practical targeted mobile ad delivery. Moreover, we propose secure billing schemes to enable the ad network to charge advertisers in a privacy-preserving manner. The security strength of our system is thoroughly analyzed. Through extensive experiments, we show that our system achieves practical efficiency on mobile devices.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7909009/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June 1 2020","volume":"13","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"19686872","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2020","publicationDate":"1 May-June 2020","htmlLink":"/document/7909009/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Practical System for Privacy-Aware Targeted Mobile Advertising Services","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Grants Council of Hong Kong","grantNumber":"CityU 138513 and CityU 11276816"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572412 and 61472316"},{"fundingName":"Innovation and Technology Commission of Hong Kong","grantNumber":"ITS/307/15"},{"fundingName":"AWS Education Research Grant"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Project of Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2016ZDJC-05"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Practical System for Privacy-Aware Targeted Mobile Advertising Services","sourcePdf":"tsc-wang-2697385-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.176111S","chronDate":"May-June 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"9114375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"9114375","articleId":"7909009","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7909014,"authors":[{"name":"Diego Valsesia","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/7921660/7909014/valse-2697402-small.gif","p":["Diego Valsesia (S\u201913\u2013M\u201917) received the Ph.D. degree in electronic and communication engineering from the Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy, in 2016, and the M.Sc. degree in telecommunications engineering from Politecnico di Torino and the M.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, in 2012 and 2013, respectively.

They require a logarithmic number of stages and are typically realized using AND-OR logic; moreover with the emergence of new device technologies based on majority logic, new and improved adder designs are possible. However, the best existing majority gate-based prefix adder incurs a delay of 2log\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n(n) - 1 (due to the nth carry); this is only marginally better than a design using only AND-OR gates (the latter design has a 2log\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n(n) + 1 gate delay). This paper initially shows that this delay is caused by the output carry equation in majority gate-based adders that is still largely defined in terms of AND-OR gates. In this paper, two new majority gate-based recursive techniques are proposed. The first technique relies on a novel formulation of the majority gate-based equations in the used group generate and group propagate hardware; this results in a new definition for the output carry, thus reducing the delay. The second contribution of this manuscript utilizes recursive properties of majority gates (through a novel operator) to reduce the circuit complexity of prefix adder designs. Overall, the proposed techniques result in the calculation of the output carry of an n-bit adder with only a majority gate delay of log\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n (n) + 1. This leads to a reduction of 40percent in delay and 30percent in circuit complexity (in terms of the number of majority gates) for multi-bit addition in comparison to the best existing designs found in the technical literature.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8026540","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/8026540/07909019.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TC.2017.2696524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2017.2696524","startPage":"1824","endPage":"1830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Majority Logic Formulations for Parallel Adder Designs at Reduced Delay and Circuit Complexity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7909019/","displayDocTitle":"Majority Logic Formulations for Parallel Adder Designs at Reduced Delay and Circuit Complexity","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7909019/","volume":"66","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"17169207","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2017","publicationDate":"1 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Majority Logic Formulations for Parallel Adder Designs at Reduced Delay and Circuit Complexity","sourcePdf":"tc-lombardi-2696524-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074476S","chronDate":"Oct. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"8026540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8026540","articleId":"7909019","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7909021,"authors":[{"name":"Evgeny Belyaev","affiliation":["Department of Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Evgeny","lastName":"Belyaev","orcid":"0000-0003-1245-0140","id":"37086031463"},{"name":"S\u00f8ren Forchhammer","affiliation":["Department of Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"S\u00f8ren","lastName":"Forchhammer","id":"38514032100"},{"name":"Marian Codreanu","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Marian","lastName":"Codreanu","id":"37268997300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7909021","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":261},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7909021","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Image reconstruction","Streaming media","Packet loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","iterative methods","video codecs","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error concealment","3D DWT","video codec","iterative thresholding","video coding","discrete wavelet transform","video sequence","2D discrete cosine transform","video block-matching","3D filtering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video error concealment","iterative thresholding"]}],"abstract":"Error concealment for video coding based on a 3-D discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is considered.

Furthermore, simulation results show that SD-MPA detector can reach low complexity detection and maintain negligible bit error ratio performance decline compared with conventional MPA.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2697425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8007375","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2697425","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8007375/07909024.pdf","startPage":"1855","endPage":"1858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Complexity MPA Detector Based on Sphere Decoding for SCMA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Low Complexity MPA Detector Based on Sphere Decoding for SCMA","volume":"21","issue":"8","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7909024/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17099400","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7909024/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61370012 and 61571082"},{"fundingName":"Huawei HIRP","grantNumber":"YB2015040056"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Complexity MPA Detector Based on Sphere Decoding for SCMA","sourcePdf":"lcomm-yang-2697425-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074702S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8007375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"8007375","articleId":"7909024","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7909029,"authors":[{"name":"Hengjie Zhang","affiliation":["Business School, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/8327949/7909029/zhang-2697403-small.gif","p":["Hengjie Zhang received the B.S. degree in information management and information system from the School of Economics and Management, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China, in 2012.

In a large-scale GDM, decision makers often have individual concerns and satisfactions, and also they will use heterogeneous preference representation structures to express their preferences. Meanwhile, it is difficult to set the numerical consensus threshold to judge whether a consensus degree can be acceptable or not in the consensus reaching process in a large-scale GDM. This study proposes a novel consensus reaching model for the heterogeneous large-scale GDM with the individual concerns and satisfactions. In this consensus reaching model, a selection process is proposed to obtain the individual preference vectors, to divide decision makers into different clusters, and to yield the preference vector of the large group. Following this, a consensus measure method that considers the individual concerns on alternatives is defined for measuring the consensus degree, and a linguistic approach is developed to measure the individual and collective satisfactions regarding the consensus degree. Finally, a feedback adjustment process is proposed and utilized to help decision makers adjust their preferences. A practical example and a simulation analysis are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed consensus reaching model.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2017.2697403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8327949","startPage":"884","endPage":"898","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/8327949/07909029.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Consensus Building for the Heterogeneous Large-Scale GDM With the Individual Concerns and Satisfactions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7909029/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7909029/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Consensus Building for the Heterogeneous Large-Scale GDM With the Individual Concerns and Satisfactions","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17683426","dateOfInsertion":"29 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"26","issue":"2","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF of China","grantNumber":"71571124 and 71171160"},{"fundingName":"FEDER","grantNumber":"TIN2013-40658-P and TIN2016-75850-R"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consensus Building for the Heterogeneous Large-Scale GDM With the Individual Concerns and Satisfactions","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-herreraviedma-2697403-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.181193S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"8327949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8327949","articleId":"7909029","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7909031,"authors":[{"name":"Harri Viittala","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7909031/viitt-2697502-small.gif","p":["Harri Viittala (M\u201917) received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland, in 2006, where he is currently pursuing the Dr.Sc. degree.

To refine the localization performance, the error in the initial solution is estimated in the sequence.

Passive fatigue results in loss of driver alertness and is detrimental to driver safety. This paper focuses on the effect of a haptic guidance steering system on improving behaviors of passively fatigued drivers. By continuously exerting active torque on a steering wheel, the haptic system guides drivers to follow the centerline of a lane; meanwhile, the drivers sense the torque and interact with it while operating the steering wheel. An experiment was conducted with 12 healthy participants in a high-fidelity driving simulator. A monotonous driving course was designed, and vehicle speed was fixed in order to induce drivers' passive fatigue. A treatment session was arranged with the haptic guidance steering system, and a control session was conducted as a comparison. Driving performance, assessed by standard deviation of lane position, mean absolute lateral error, and time-to-lane crossing, was significantly improved when haptic guidance was activated. Results of physiological measures, including heart rate variability and percentage of eye closure, revealed that passively fatigued drivers were aroused when they were aware of the active torque on the steering wheel. In conclusion, the activation of haptic guidance can be regarded as an effective countermeasure for the passively fatigued drivers who have performed a prolonged monotonous driving task.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Effect of a Haptic Guidance Steering System on Fatigue-Related Driver Behavior","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems","doi":"10.1109/THMS.2017.2693230","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221037/8038150/07909037.pdf","startPage":"741","endPage":"748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THMS.2017.2693230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038150","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7909037","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7909037/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","displayDocTitle":"The Effect of a Haptic Guidance Steering System on Fatigue-Related Driver Behavior","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7909037/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17171350","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B)","grantNumber":"25289049"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001667","fundingName":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effect of a Haptic Guidance Steering System on Fatigue-Related Driver Behavior","sourcePdf":"thms-wang-2693230-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108245S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6221037","isNumber":"8038150","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221037","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8038150","articleId":"7909037","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7909039,"authors":[{"name":"Somesh Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Ropar, Rupnagar, Punjab, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687315/8466693/7909039/kumar-2696941-small.gif","p":["Somesh Kumar (S\u201913) received the BTech degree in electronics\n and communication engineering from Kurukshetra University, Kurukshetra, India, in 2009 and the MTech degree in VLSI\n design and CAD from Thapar University, Patiala, India, in 2012.

This is quite pertinent for high-performance manycore processors/servers, where on-chip interconnects are increasingly emerging as one of the key performance bottlenecks. This paper presents a novel analytical model for parameter extraction in current and future on-chip interconnects. Our proposed model aids in analyzing the impact of spatial and vertical surface roughness on their electrical performance. Our analysis clearly depicts that as the technology nodes scale down; the effect of the surface roughness becomes dominant and cannot be ignored. Based on AFM images of fabricated ultra-thin copper sheets, we have extracted roughness parameters to define realistic surface profiles using the well-known Mandelbrot-Weierstrass (MW) fractal function. For our analysis, we have considered four current and future interconnect technology nodes (i.e., 45, 22, 13, 7 nm) and evaluated the impact of surface roughness on typical performance metrics, such as delay, energy, and bandwidth. Results obtained using our model are verified by comparing with industry standard field solver Ansys HFSS as well as available experimental data that exhibits accuracy within 9 percent. We present signal integrity analysis using the eye diagram at 1, 5, 10, and 18 Gbps bit rates to find the increase in frequency dependent losses due to surface roughness. Finally, simulating a standard three line on-chip interconnect structure, we also report the computational overhead incurred for different values of roughness and technology nodes.","doi":"10.1109/TMSCS.2017.2696941","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8466693","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMSCS.2017.2696941","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687315/8466693/07909039.pdf","startPage":"272","endPage":"284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical Modeling and Performance Benchmarking of On-Chip Interconnects with Rough Surfaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Analytical Modeling and Performance Benchmarking of On-Chip Interconnects with Rough Surfaces","volume":"4","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept. 1 2018","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7909039/","publicationDate":"1 July-Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18094951","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7909039/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Department of Science and Technology, Government of India","grantNumber":"SB/FTP/ETA-40/2013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical Modeling and Performance Benchmarking of On-Chip Interconnects with Rough Surfaces","sourcePdf":"tmscs-sharma-2696941-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108172S","chronDate":"July-Sept. 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"6687315","isNumber":"8466693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687315","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8466693","articleId":"7909039","onlineDate":"24 April 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7909041,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph Connelly","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Joseph Connelly (S\u201912) was born in Milwaukee in 1991.

Here, we consider the more general setting of linear network coding over finite (possibly non-commutative) rings and modules. We prove the following results regarding the linear solvability of directed acyclic networks over various finite alphabets. For any network, the following are equivalent: (i) vector linear solvability over some field, (ii) scalar linear solvability over some ring, and (iii) linear solvability over some module. Analogously, the following are equivalent: (a) scalar linear solvability over some field, (b) scalar linear solvability over some commutative ring, and (c) linear solvability over some module whose ring is commutative. Whenever any network is linearly solvable over a module, a smallest such module arises in a vector linear solution for that network over a field. If a network is scalar linearly solvable over some non-commutative ring but not over any commutative ring, then such a non-commutative ring must have size at least 16, and for some networks, this bound is achieved. An infinite family of networks is demonstrated, each of which is scalar linearly solvable over some non-commutative ring but not over any commutative ring. Whenever p is prime and 1 \u2264 k \u2264 6, if a network is scalar linearly solvable over some ring of size p\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</sup>\n, then it is also k-dimensional vector linearly solvable over the field GF(p), but the converse does not necessarily hold.

These instruments have been employed in different military and commercial applications, such as spectrum surveillance, electronic warfare, and software-defined and cognitive radios. The focus of this paper is automatic instruments that can identify cellular network signals. Novel identification features are presented, which are based on the statistical properties and characteristic features of the candidate signals. In particular, the signal cumulative distribution function is employed as an identification feature for the global system for mobile communication and long term evolution (LTE) downlink signals. The presence of the cyclic prefix is exploited to identify the LTE uplink signal, while the estimated signal bandwidth is used to differentiate between the universal mobile telecommunication system and code division multiple access 2000 signals. Experimental tests are performed to verify the validity of the proposed identification method. The experimental results show that the identification method achieves very good performance with short observation intervals leading to improved response time under different channel conditions. Moreover, the presented method is robust to timing and frequency offsets.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of Cellular Networks for Intelligent Radio

number of time constrained functions. During software architecture design, these functions must be assigned to tasks that will run the functions on the top of a real-time operating systems (RTOS). This is a challenging work due to the large number of valid candidate functions to tasks assignment solutions. Moreover, the impact of the assignment on the system performance criteria (often conflicting) should be taken into account in the architecture exploration. The automation of the design exploration by the use of metaheuristics such as multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is a suitable way to help the designers. MOEAs approximate near-optimal alternatives at a reasonable time when compared to an exact search method. However, for large-scale systems even a MOEA method is impractical due to the increased time required to solve a problem instance. To tackle this problem, we present in this article a parallel implementation of the Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy (PAES) algorithm used as a MOEA for the design exploration. The proposed parallelization method is based on the well-known Master-Slave paradigm. Additionally, it involves a new selection scheme in the PAES algorithm. Results of experimentations provide evidence that, on one hand, the parallel approach can considerably speed up the design exploration and the optimization processes. On the other hand, the proposed selection strategy improves the quality of obtained solutions as compared to the original PAES selection schema.","doi":"10.1145/2990299.2990310","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Rapid System Prototyping (RSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7907640/7909113/07909125.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Rapid System Prototyping (RSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2990299.2990310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7909113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient parallel multi-objective optimization for real-time systems software design exploration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Real-time systems","Computer architecture","Algorithm design and analysis","Master-slave","Computational modeling","Design methodology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","evolutionary computation","operating systems (computers)","parallel processing","Pareto optimisation","search problems","software architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel multiobjective optimization","software design exploration","real-time embedded systems","time constrained functions","software architecture design","real-time operating systems","RTOS","task assignment solutions","system performance criteria","metaheuristics","multiobjective evolutionary algorithm","exact search method","large-scale systems","MOEA method","Pareto archived evolution strategy","PAES algorithm","master-slave paradigm","parallelization method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Real-Time Embedded Systems","Design exploration","Multi-Objective Optimization","PAES","Parallelism","Master-Slave Model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7909125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Efficient parallel multi-objective optimization for real-time systems software design exploration","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7909125/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"27 April 2017","conferenceDate":"6-7 Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16851385","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient parallel multi-objective optimization for real-time systems software design exploration","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"p058-bouaziz.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.176308S","chronDate":"6-7 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7907640","isNumber":"7909113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7907640","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7909113","articleId":"7909125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7909127,"authors":[{"name":"Takeshi Ohkawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Utsunomiya University, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Ohkawa","id":"37284454400"},{"name":"Kazushi Yamashina","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Utsunomiya University, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazushi","lastName":"Yamashina","id":"37086009233"},{"name":"Takuya Matsumoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Utsunomiya University, Japan"],"firstName":"Takuya","lastName":"Matsumoto","id":"37086037735"},{"name":"Kanemitsu Ootsu","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Utsunomiya University, Japan"],"firstName":"Kanemitsu","lastName":"Ootsu","id":"37270171900"},{"name":"Takashi Yokota","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Utsunomiya University, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Yokota","id":"37085987638"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4535-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3926-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-5519"}],"articleNumber":"7909127","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":570},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","intelligent robots","operating systems (computers)","parallel processing","SLAM (robots)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent autonomous robot system","ROS-compliant FPGA component technology","visual SLAM processing","Self Localization and Mapping"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","robot","Architecture exploration","ROS","component-oriented development"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel method for architecture exploration of an intelligent robot system while satisfying high processing performance at low power by utilizing FPGA and remote computing resources.

As a case study, Visual SLAM (Self Localization and Mapping) processing is studied, which is important for realizing intelligent autonomous robots. Some part of Visual SLAM processing is to be off-loaded onto a remote server outside a robot and to be processed parallel in the server. At the same time, the essential part of front-end of SLAM processing stays in the robot itself to reduce communication traffic between the robot and the remote computing resources. We have studied SLAM processing to find optimum function partitioning. In order to distribute and parallelize this processing, we explored processing architecture for trade-offs of power and performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architecture exploration of intelligent robot system using ros-compliant FPGA component","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Rapid System Prototyping (RSP)","doi":"10.1145/2990299.2990312","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Rapid System Prototyping (RSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7907640/7909113/07909127.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2990299.2990312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7909113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7909127","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7909127/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Architecture exploration of intelligent robot system using ros-compliant FPGA component","conferenceDate":"6-7 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7909127/","dateOfInsertion":"27 April 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16851389","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecture exploration of intelligent robot system using ros-compliant FPGA component","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"p072-ohkawa.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079818S","chronDate":"6-7 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7907640","isNumber":"7909113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7907640","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7909113","articleId":"7909127","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7909129,"authors":[{"name":"Jakob Wenzel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"],"firstName":"Jakob","lastName":"Wenzel","id":"37085998406"},{"name":"Christian Hochberger","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Hochberger","id":"37313862600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4535-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3926-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-5519"}],"articleNumber":"7909129","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Routing","Runtime","Clocks","Hardware","Random access memory","Pins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short turnaround creation","RapidSoC","FPGA based SoCs","field programmable gate arrays","systems-on-chip","soft-core processors","standard peripheral selection","design space exploration","reduced operating frequency","benchmark system configurations","commercial synthesis tools","system clock frequency"]}],"abstract":"Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) offer the opportunity to build individual hardware solutions even for applications which are produced in small quantity.

However, performance of multi-FPGA based systems is severely affected by widening logic to I/O gap in FPGAs. In order to address the performance issue, in this work, we propose an exploration and optimization flow for multi-FPGA based prototyping that gives an end-to-end experience starting from benchmark generation to optimized inter- FPGA routing. Using generic tools of the flow, ten large benchmarks are generated. Then, through a generic novel inter-FPGA routing environment, effect of variation of number of FPGAs as well as number of inter-FPGA tracks on the performance of a target design is explored. For performance exploration and optimization, five different FPGA boards are utilized where number of FPGAs on board are varied from two to six. Moreover, for each board four different inter-FPGA track combinations are used. Experimental results reveal that multi-FPGA boards with inter-FPGA tracks corresponding optimally to the cut net requirements of benchmarks under consideration give best frequency results. Furthermore, frequency comparison between different boards shows that FPGA board with six FPGAs gives, on average, best frequency results. Finally, we also perform frequency-price analysis which shows that board with four FPGAs gives better frequency-price tradeoff as compared to other FPGA boards under consideration.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7909132/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16851382","htmlLink":"/document/7909132/","dateOfInsertion":"27 April 2017","conferenceDate":"6-7 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Inter-FPGA routing environment for performance exploration of multi-FPGA systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inter-FPGA routing environment for performance exploration of multi-FPGA systems","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"p107-farooq.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05433S","chronDate":"6-7 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7907640","isNumber":"7909113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7907640","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7909113","articleId":"7909132","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7909157,"authors":[{"name":"Alessio Meloni","affiliation":["University of Cagliari"],"bio":{"p":["Alessio Meloni [S'12, M'15] received his Ph.D. degree from the University of Cagliari (Italy) in March 2014.

However, at the same time, the volume and complexity of data in the grid explode. To address this challenge, big data technology is a strong candidate for the analysis and processing of smart grid data. In this article, we propose a big data computing architecture for smart grid analytics, which involves data resources, transmission, storage, and analysis. In order to enable big data computing in smart grid, a communication architecture is then described consisting of four main domains. Key technologies to enable big-data-aware wireless communication for smart grid are investigated. As a case study of the proposed architecture, we introduce a big-data-enabled storage planning scheme based on wireless big data computing. A hybrid approach is adopted for the optimization including GA for storage planning and a game theoretic inner optimization for daily energy scheduling. Simulation results indicate that the proposed storage planning scheme greatly reduces the cost of consumers from a long-term view.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2017.1600256WC","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/7909083/07909159.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"64","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7909083","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2017.1600256WC","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Big Data Computing in Smart Grid","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7909159","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Big Data Computing in Smart Grid","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7909159/","publicationDate":"April 2017","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16838338","htmlLink":"/document/7909159/","volume":"24","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Big Data Computing in Smart Grid","sourcePdf":"016DENG_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079631S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"7909083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"7909083","articleId":"7909159","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7909207,"authors":[{"name":"Sharin Ab Ghani","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka, Melaka, Malaysia","Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/94/7909166/7909207/7909207-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sharin Ab Ghani (M'12) received his BEng.

NEI oils are well-known for having high fire and flash points, great moisture tolerance, good biodegradability and non-toxicity. However, NEI oils also have several drawbacks compared to mineral insulation (MI) oils such as low oxidative stability, high viscosity, low pour point and low resistance towards lightning impulse. Previous researchers have discovered that the oxidative stability of NEI oils can be improved by the addition of mixed antioxidants. However, such studies are focused on only one criterion and they neglect the dielectric strength of the oils. On the other hand, the one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) method is commonly used to determine the optimum concentration of mixed antioxidants and requires a large number of samples. In this study, response surface methodology (RSM) technique is used to determine the optimum concentration of mixed antioxidants which will enhance the oxidative stability of NEI oil. The dielectric strength of the NEI oil is evaluated based on the AC breakdown voltage (BdV). RSM is chosen in this study because it is capable of determining the optimum values of the parameters of interest, without the need for a large number of test runs which will incur high cost for experimentation. A regression model is developed in this study based on the AC breakdown voltage of the NEI oil, propyl gallate and citric acid antioxidant concentrations. The oxidative induction time (OIT) and partial discharge inception voltage (PDIV) are carried out to determine the effect of the oxidative stability and withstand voltage on the partial discharge, respectively. The results showed that there is enhancement in the oxidative stability and dielectric strength of NEI oil using the optimum concentrations of mixed antioxidants relative to the fresh NEI oil. It can be concluded that RSM is a feasible alternative to determine the optimum concentration of antioxidants for NEI oils, which in turn, helps improve the oxidative stability and dielectric strength of these oils.","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2017.006221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7909166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2017.006221","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel7/94/7909166/07909207.pdf","startPage":"974","endPage":"983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of response surface methodology for optimizing the oxidative stability of natural ester oil using mixed antioxidants","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Application of response surface methodology for optimizing the oxidative stability of natural ester oil using mixed antioxidants","volume":"24","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7909207/","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16838490","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7909207/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of response surface methodology for optimizing the oxidative stability of natural ester oil using mixed antioxidants","sourcePdf":"p0974.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147469S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"7909166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7909166","articleId":"7909207","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7909221,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In case of medium voltage overhead lines with covered conductors, the internal partial discharges indicate the degradation of insulation system, rupture or downfall of the line. The reliability and selectivity of methods to detect internal partial discharges in the covered conductors are mainly given by the level of background noise. The background noise distorts the pattern of partial discharges (PD-pattern) and decreases the capability of detection methods to recognize the features of PD-pattern corresponding to the degradation of an insulation system.

The surface condition and DC breakdown voltage of pressboard samples after PD pretreatment are observed and measured. In addition, a fitting formula to evaluate the degradation extent of pressboard samples is proposed. The results show that under constant PD pretreatments, surface roughness of pressboard samples decreases first and increases afterwards. The changing rate is positively correlated with PD intensity. During PD pretreatment, a \u201cwhitish-colored circular region\u201d appears at samples' surface and grows with PD intensity. For PD pretreatments of 500 pC and 1000 pC, DC breakdown voltage of pressboard samples remains unchanged. The breakdown spot has no clear carbonization nor creepage trace. For PD pretreatments of 2000 pC and 3000 pC, DC breakdown voltage decreases. The breakdown spot is obviously carbonized and creepage paths emerge around spots. Further analysis indicates that degradation of oil-immersed pressboard samples due to DC PDs is the result of motion activation process induced by electrical and thermal effects under DC electric field.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7909223/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7909223/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16838483","volume":"24","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Degradation characteristics of oil-immersed pressboard samples induced by partial discharges under DC voltage","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Degradation characteristics of oil-immersed pressboard samples induced by partial discharges under DC voltage","sourcePdf":"p1110.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074957S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"7909166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7909166","articleId":"7909223","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"}]
