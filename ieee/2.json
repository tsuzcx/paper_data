A 17363 cell, 1.31 cm resolution, anatomically based model of the human torso surrounded by a bolus of deionized water is used for calculations of specific absorption rates (SARs). Test runs on the calculation of fields in the water-filled interaction space and with homogeneous circular- and elliptical-cylinder phantoms correlate well with the experimental data in the literature, lending support to the accuracy of the FDTD method for near-field exposure conditions. Results are given for APAs using different sizes of aperture and dipole antennas and for a subannular array to obtain higher SARs in the liver.

On the basis of the partial variational principle (PVP), the fields interior and exterior to the discontinuity finite-element region can be treated independently and eventually can be coupled. The interior fields are expanded by the finite-element nodal values and the corresponding local bases, while the exterior ones are handled by an approach combining modal expansion and Green's function. In numerical computation, the continuous spectra of the waveguide modes are discretized by the Laguerre expansion method. To check the correctness of the present analysis, two numerical results are compared to those of other methods. The scattering characteristics of several linearly tapered discontinuities, such as transformers and feed structures, are analyzed and compared to those having step junctions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.20040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=793","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.20040","endPage":"214","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00020040.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/793/00020040.pdf","startPage":"208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A partial variational approach for arbitrary discontinuities in planar dielectric waveguides","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/20040/","displayDocTitle":"A partial variational approach for arbitrary discontinuities in planar dielectric waveguides","volume":"37","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"3354578","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A partial variational approach for arbitrary discontinuities in planar dielectric waveguides","sourcePdf":"00020040.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050248S","chronDate":"Jan 1989","isNumber":"793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"22","articleId":"20040","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":20041,"authors":[{"name":"V.K.

It was found that it is possible to obtain resonant mode quality factors of 20 or less with film resistivities between 10 and 30 Omega /sq on high-dielectric-constant substrates. Thin films of this resistivity can be formed on alumina, which has a high dielectric constant, by evaporating approximately 100-1000 AA of chrome or titanium on its surface. The backside of the alumina substrate can then be metallized and soldered to the lid of a package containing a large monolithic microwave integrated circuit, using the same proven technology used to affix the circuit to the bottom of the package, effectively damping the lowest order cavity mode supported by the package.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=793","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.20046","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00020046.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/793/00020046.pdf","startPage":"253","endPage":"256","doi":"10.1109/22.20046","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Damping of the resonant modes of a rectangular metal package (MMICs)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1989","displayDocTitle":"Damping of the resonant modes of a rectangular metal package (MMICs)","volume":"37","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","accessionNumber":"3354584","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/20046/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damping of the resonant modes of a rectangular metal package (MMICs)","sourcePdf":"00020046.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023807S","chronDate":"Jan 1989","isNumber":"793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"30","articleId":"20046","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":20062,"authors":[{"name":"K.S.

The novelty of the scheme is based on the observation that whereas the change in phase of the received signal over a full symbol contains the sum of the data (phase) and the Doppler-induced phase shift, the same change in phase over half a symbol (within a given symbol interval) contains only the Doppler-induced phase shift. Thus, by proper processing, the latter can be estimated and removed from the former. Analytical and simulation results are given for the variance of the above estimator, and the error probability performance of the MDPSK receiver is evaluated in the presence of the Doppler correction. Next, the practical considerations associated with the application of this technique on bandlimited Nyquist channels are discussed and incorporated into the final design. It is shown that the receiver can, in the absence of timing jitter, be designed to allow combined Doppler correction and data detection with no penalty due to intersymbol interference (ISI). The effects of ISI due to timing jitter are assessed by computer simulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.20075","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/795/00020075.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.20075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=795","startPage":"99","endPage":"109","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00020075.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Doppler-corrected differential detection of MPSK","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=20075","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Doppler-corrected differential detection of MPSK","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/20075/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1989","accessionNumber":"3376232","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Doppler-corrected differential detection of MPSK","sourcePdf":"00020075.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051224S","chronDate":"Feb 1989","isNumber":"795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"48","articleId":"20075","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":20078,"authors":[{"name":"M.

First, the overall bit rate for an AWGN channel with a two-level transfer function is maximized, using a multitone QAM system. The power distribution between the tones and the number of bits/symbol per tone is optimized for a given symbol error rate. Extending these results to the general channel, it is shown that the optimum power division for multitone signals is similar to the water-pouring solution of information theory. Furthermore, multitone QAM performance is about 9 dB worse than the channel capacity, independent of the channel characteristics. The multitone results throughout are compared to those of an equivalent single-tone linearly equalized system. The comparison shows that the multitone system is useful for some channels, e.g. those with deep nulls in the transfer function. The maximum bit error rate over a twisted-pair channel which is performance dominated by near-end crosstalk (NEXT) is also found.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.20079","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/795/00020079.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.20079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=795","startPage":"119","endPage":"124","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00020079.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The multitone channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=20079","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The multitone channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/20079/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1989","accessionNumber":"3376234","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The multitone channel","sourcePdf":"00020079.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057114S","chronDate":"Feb 1989","isNumber":"795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"386","articleId":"20079","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":20080,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.

Ratio-statistic combining is proposed for mitigating partial-band interference in systems with diversity transmission and frequency-hop signaling. Systems with noncoherent demodulation and binary orthogonal signaling are covered. The partial-band interference is Gaussian, and Gaussian quiescent noise is included in the analysis to account for wideband noise sources. The exact probability of error is found for a receiver using ratio-statistic combining, and this is compared to the exact error probabilities for receivers with optimum combining with perfect side information, clipped-linear combining, the ratio-threshold test with majority-logic decoding, and self-normalization diversity combining. Numerical results are also given for a frequency-hop system which uses ratio-statistic combining for channels with Rayleigh fading and partial-band interference. It is determined that ratio-statistic combining is an excellent diversity combining scheme for systems with partial-band interference and fading.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.20082","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","startPage":"145","endPage":"151","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/795/00020082.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00020082.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.20082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clipped diversity combining for channels with partial-band interference.

To reduce these artifacts, a class of unitary transformations, called lapped orthogonal transforms (LOT), is investigated.

An example of an LOT optimized in terms of energy compaction is numerically derived, using an augmented Lagrangian optimization algorithm. Using this LOT, intraframe coding experiments for 256*240 pixel images were performed at bit rates between 0.1 and 0.35 bits/pixel. The LOT improved the coded image subjective quality over other transforms. The LOT was also used in interframe full-motion video coding experiments for head and shoulder sequences at 28 and 56 kb/s. Significant improvement resulted at low data rates and if no motion compensation were used.

Calculated results for MSK show that the BER performance is strongly dependent on the RMS-delay/bit-duration ratio and that the delay-spectrum shape is of no importance when the receiver predetection filter product is optimized for the effect of AWGN. The effect of fading correlation on the diversity improvement is also analyzed for a two-branch case with multiplicative Rayleigh fading signals.

The impact of pointing and tracking errors on the design of direct-detection pulse-position modulation (PPM) and heterodyne noncoherent frequency-shift keying (NCFSK) systems is then analyzed in terms of constraints on the antenna size and the power penalty incurred. It is shown that in the limit of large spatial tracking errors, the advantage in receiver sensitivity for the heterodyne system is quickly offset by the smaller antenna gain and the higher power penalty due to tracking errors.

A good estimate of the efficiency of any coding system is given by the system coding gain over scalar PCM (pulse code modulation). Based on the optimal bit allocation, the coding gain of the vector transform quantization (VTQ) system operating on a stationary input signal is derived. The VTQ coding gain demonstrates a significant advantage of vector quantization over scalar quantization within the framework of transform coding.

A receiver is considered that is based on the generalized likelihood-ratio test (GLRT), in which the interferer is modeled as an Nth-order circular Gaussian autoregressive (AR) process and the multipath channel is represented by a tapped-delay line. The maximum-likelihood joint estimator for the channel coefficients and interferer AR parameters is then derived. Analytical expressions for bit-error rate are presented for GLRT receiver, under the assumption of perfect estimates of the channel and interferer parameters. The performance of the GLRT receiver is compared to that of a DS receiver using a transversal equalizer. It is shown that the GLRT receiver consistently outperforms the equalizer-based receiver by 2-3 dB. The performance of an adaptive GLRT receiver is evaluated where the recursive least-squares algorithm is used to jointly estimate the interferer and channel parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/796/00020102.pdf","startPage":"277","endPage":"288","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00020102.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=796","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.20102","doi":"10.1109/26.20102","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=20102","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spread spectrum communication","Channel estimation","Equalizers","Narrowband","Interference","Testing","Multipath channels","Maximum likelihood estimation","Bit error rate","Recursive estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["errors","estimation theory","interference suppression","radio receivers","spread spectrum communication","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalised likelihood ratio test","circular Gaussian autoregressive process","spread-spectrum receiver","joint channel estimation","interference suppression","narrowband interference","multipath channel","tapped-delay line","maximum-likelihood joint estimator","channel coefficients","bit-error rate","recursive least-squares algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/20102/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1989","displayDocTitle":"A GLRT-based spread-spectrum receiver for joint channel estimation and interference suppression","accessionNumber":"3376254","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1989","volume":"37","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A GLRT-based spread-spectrum receiver for joint channel estimation and interference suppression","sourcePdf":"00020102.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033559S","chronDate":"Mar 1989","isNumber":"796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"20","articleId":"20102","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":20103,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Analytical solutions of the performance of these systems have been very difficult to obtain. Monte Carlo simulations are often the most tractable method of estimating performance. However, in systems with small probability of error, this technique requires very large amounts of computer time. A technique known as importance sampling substantially reduces the number of simulation trials needed, for a given accuracy, over the standard Monte Carlo method. The theory and application of the importance sampling method in Monte Carlo simulation is considered in a signal detection context. A general method of applying this technique to the optimal detection problem is given. Results show that in cases examined, the gain is approximately proportional to the inverse of the error probability. Applications of the proposed method are not limited to optimum detection systems; analysis, leading to a measure of the gain in using this biasing scheme, shows that in all optimal systems considered, less than 100 trials is needed to achieve estimates with 45% confidence, even for extremely small error probabilities.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","startPage":"332","endPage":"339","doi":"10.1109/26.20113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.20113","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/797/00020113.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00020113.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=797","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the theory of importance sampling applied to the analysis of detection systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/20113/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1989","displayDocTitle":"On the theory of importance sampling applied to the analysis of detection systems","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1989","accessionNumber":"3393968","volume":"37","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the theory of importance sampling applied to the analysis of detection systems","sourcePdf":"00020113.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03989S","chronDate":"Apr 1989","isNumber":"797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"49","articleId":"20113","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":20118,"authors":[{"name":"K.M.

The proposed methods take advantage of the VLDPCM code's high sensitivity to errors. Two methods are described. The first involves no increase of transmitted bit rate and consists of processing the corrupted image. The second method involves the transmission of additional information to enable an almost exact reconstruction of the original image. The amount of added redundancy can be reduced at the cost of performing more computations. In a simulation, the authors used less than 7% redundancy. Both methods achieve significant improvements which are demonstrated by the simulation results. The simulation results include original, corrupted, and enhanced images as well as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) versus bit-error rate (BER) curve. For BER 10/sup -3/, the SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) gains for the first and second methods are greater than 17 and 44 dB, respectively.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/20118/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1989","accessionNumber":"3393973","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Enhancement of one-dimensional variable-length DPCM images corrupted by transmission errors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancement of one-dimensional variable-length DPCM images corrupted by transmission errors","sourcePdf":"00020118.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038219S","chronDate":"Apr 1989","isNumber":"797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"21","articleId":"20118","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":20119,"authors":[{"name":"S.-B.

In this approach, an image is separated into high-frequency and low-frequency components. The low-frequency signal is processed by an adaptive spatiotemporal DPCM codec. A motion indicator derived from the low-frequency signal is used to control the corresponding block of high-frequency component pixels. The system is aimed at adaptively removing the high-frequency component of an image in those areas which contain motion. Since less information is needed to be sent, the data rate is lower. Since the missing high-frequency information occurs only in moving areas, the human eyes are less likely to notice. In this way, the data rate is lowered without unduly giving up on the subjective image quality. Simulation results have shown that the amount of visible degradation in image quality is small while the reduction in data rate is substantial.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-tier DPCM codec for videoconferencing","doi":"10.1109/26.20119","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00020119.png","startPage":"380","endPage":"386","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.20119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=797","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/797/00020119.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=20119","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/20119/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1989","displayDocTitle":"Two-tier DPCM codec for videoconferencing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"37","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1989","accessionNumber":"3393974","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-tier DPCM codec for videoconferencing","sourcePdf":"00020119.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072917S","chronDate":"Apr 1989","isNumber":"797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"1","articleId":"20119","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":20122,"authors":[{"name":"M.S.

Confusion had arisen because of the choice of a value of a parameter in the approximating expression. The practice had been to choose this simply as though it was just an arbitrary constant which scales the input, or as an optimizing parameter in the effort to get a best fit of the approximation to the measured data. By examining the derivation of the particular approximation, a determining and important link between this parameter and the desired operating dynamic range of the nonlinear characteristic being approximated is shown. How values for this parameter are calculated in terms of input overdrive relative to device saturation is also shown. In examining the origin of the approximating expressions, an alternative and simpler derivation to that given by J.C. Fuenzalida et al. (1973) is presented that is based on the work of M.J.

It is shown that MOD-CHAR leads to better complexity results for J.P. Char's algorithm than what could be obtained using the straightforward implementation implied in Char's original presentation (see IEEE Trans. Circuit Theory, Vol.15, p.228-38, 1968). The class of graphs for which MOD-CHAR and, hence, Char's algorithm, has linear time complexity per spanning tree generated is identified. This class is more general than the corresponding one identified in R. Jayakumar et al. (see ibid., vol.31, no.10, p.853-60, 1984). Using a result on random graphs, it is proved that for almost all graphs MOD-CHAR has linear worst-case time complexity per spanning tree generated. It is also shown that for any complete graph MOD-CHAR requires, on the average, at most seven computational steps to generate a spanning tree. This result and computational experiences provide evidence to believe that for dense graphs of any order the time complexity of MOD-CHAR is O(t), where t is the number of spanning trees generated. On the other hand, there is enough evidence to conclude that for sparse graphs, Char's original implementation is superior to MOD-CHAR.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/31.20199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.20199","endPage":"228","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/799/00020199.pdf","startPage":"219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MOD-CHAR: an implementation of Char's spanning tree enumeration algorithm and its complexity analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/20199/","displayDocTitle":"MOD-CHAR: an implementation of Char's spanning tree enumeration algorithm and its complexity analysis","volume":"36","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"3394006","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1989","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MOD-CHAR: an implementation of Char's spanning tree enumeration algorithm and its complexity analysis","sourcePdf":"00020199.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036446S","chronDate":"Feb 1989","isNumber":"799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"13","articleId":"20199","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":20200,"authors":[{"name":"A.N.

Such networks are viewed as an interconnection of many single neurons. The results are phrased in terms of the qualitative properties of the individual neurons and in terms of the properties of the interconnecting structure of the neural networks. This method of analysis makes it frequently possible to circumvent difficulties usually encountered in the analysis of complex systems with high dimension. Aspects of neural networks which are addressed include asymptotic stability, exponential stability, and instability of an equilibrium; estimates of trajectory bounds; estimates of the domain of attraction of an asymptotically stable equilibrium: and stability of neural networks under structural perturbations (arising, e.g. during adaptive learning schemes). The results are not overly conservative. Furthermore, they are in a form which will make them highly useful as constraints in synthesis or design procedures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/799/00020200.pdf","startPage":"229","endPage":"243","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/31.20200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.20200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=20200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Qualitative analysis of neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Asymptotic stability","Neurons","Large-scale systems","Hopfield neural networks","Network synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large-scale systems","neural nets","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","qualitative theory","large-scale interconnected dynamical systems","Hopfield model","neurons","asymptotic stability","exponential stability","instability","asymptotically stable equilibrium","learning schemes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/20200/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1989","displayDocTitle":"Qualitative analysis of neural networks","volume":"36","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1989","accessionNumber":"3383884","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Qualitative analysis of neural networks","sourcePdf":"00020200.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036327S","chronDate":"Feb 1989","isNumber":"799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"281","articleId":"20200","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":20203,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

The presence of an inductive source makes it difficult to design such an amplifier to meet both low-noise and stability requirements. A novel feedback configuration is proposed. The use of this configuration gives good noise performance and at the same time realizes a constant transimpedance. The stability and signal transfer conditions for four different cases are derived. Noise analysis and optimization performed for each case yield amplifiers with optimal noise performance. Four amplifiers have been designed to verify the analytical results. The amplifier is suitable to be implemented in bipolar junction transistor technology and can be used as the preamplifier in an upconversion radio receiver. A transimpedance of 220 k Omega and total equivalent input noise current density between 0.35 to 0.75 pA/ square root Hz have been achieved in the whole AM band.

The MODIS is composed of two mutually supporting sensors that cover a swath width sufficient to provide nearly complete two-day global coverage from a polar-orbiting, sun-synchronous, serviceable platform. High signal-to-noise ratios are to be provided, e.g. 500 to 1 or greater with 10-12-bit quantization over the dynamic ranges of the spectral bands. MODIS' lifetime is expected to be about ten years. One of the MODIS sensors is termed MODIS-N, where N signifies nadir-viewing. The companion to MODIS-N is MODIS-T, where T signifies a tiltable field-of-view. The development of the MODIS facility from conceptual design studies (Phase-A) into detailed design studies (Phase-B) is discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.20292","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/806/00020292.pdf","startPage":"145","endPage":"153","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.20292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MODIS: advanced facility instrument for studies of the Earth as a system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=20292","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/20292/","displayDocTitle":"MODIS: advanced facility instrument for studies of the Earth as a system","volume":"27","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1989","accessionNumber":"3383991","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MODIS: advanced facility instrument for studies of the Earth as a system","sourcePdf":"00020292.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056396S","chronDate":"Mar 1989","isNumber":"806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"737","articleId":"20292","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":20294,"authors":[{"name":"B.L.

MISR is a pushbroom imaging system designed to obtain continuous imagery of the sunlit Earth at four different view angles (25.8 degrees , 45.6 degrees , 60.0 degrees , and 72.5 degrees relative to the vertical at the Earth's surface), in both the forward and aftward directions relative to nadir, using eight separate cameras. Observations will be acquired in four spectral bands, centered at 440, 550, 670, and 860 nm. Data analysis algorithms will be applied to MISR imagery to retrieve the optical, geometric, and radiative properties of complex, three-dimensional scenes, such as aerosol-laden atmospheres above a heterogeneously reflecting surface, nonstratified cloud systems, and vegetation canopies. The MISR investigation will address a number of scientific questions concerning the climatic and ecological consequences of many natural and anthropogenic processes, and will furnish the aerosol information necessary.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.20299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=806","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00020299.png","startPage":"200","endPage":"214","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/806/00020299.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.20299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MISR: A multiangle imaging spectroradiometer for geophysical and climatological research from Eos","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spectroradiometers","Optical imaging","Instruments","Earth Observing System","Cameras","Data analysis","Information retrieval","Image retrieval","Geometrical optics","Layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric measuring apparatus","geophysical equipment","radiometers","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visible","geometric properties","optical properties","atmospheric measuring apparatus","MISR","multiangle imaging spectroradiometer","Eos","Earth Observing System","pushbroom imaging system","algorithms","radiative properties","three-dimensional scenes","aerosol-laden atmospheres","heterogeneously reflecting surface","nonstratified cloud systems","vegetation canopies","ecological consequences","anthropogenic processes","440 to 860 nm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1989","displayDocTitle":"MISR: A multiangle imaging spectroradiometer for geophysical and climatological research from Eos","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/20299/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"27","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3394103","publicationDate":"March 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MISR: A multiangle imaging spectroradiometer for geophysical and climatological research from Eos","sourcePdf":"00020299.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089115S","chronDate":"March  1989","isNumber":"806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"114","articleId":"20299","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":20301,"authors":[{"name":"T.J.

Recently, algorithms of iterative reconstruction-reprojection (IRR) based on the method of convolution-backprojection have been proposed for application in limited-view CT. Reprojection was used in an iterative fashion alternating with backprojection as a means of estimating projection values within the sector of missing views. In algebraic methods of reconstruction for CT, only those projections corresponding to known data are required. Reprojection along missing views would merely serve to introduce redundant equations. Computer simulation studies are presented which demonstrate significantly improved reconstructed images achieved by an ART algorithm as compared to IRR methods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algebraic reconstruction in CT from limited views","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/42.20361","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/811/00020361.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"55","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.20361","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=811","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=20361","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/20361/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1989","displayDocTitle":"Algebraic reconstruction in CT from limited views","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1989","accessionNumber":"3365085","pubMedId":"18230499","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algebraic reconstruction in CT from limited views","sourcePdf":"00020361.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05278S","chronDate":"March  1989","isNumber":"811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"174","articleId":"20361","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":20363,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

Given a digitized hand radiograph, HANDX segments out specific bones and measures particular parameters of the bones, without requiring specific characterization of noise variations in background contrast and anatomical differences which arise from patient variation. Observer variability is reduced by the system, and the resulting measurement may be useful for detecting short-term skeletal growth abnormalities in children and may additional clinical applications. The overall system is modularized into three stages: preprocessing, segmentation, and measurement. In the preprocessing state model-based histogram modification is used to normalize the radiograph. The histogram model is based on the physics of the imaging process. The segmentation stage finds and outlines specific bones using domain-dependent and domain-independent knowledge of hand anatomy and physiology and image edges. The measurement stage obtains clinically useful quantitative parameters from the segmented image.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/20363/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1989","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3365087","pubMedId":"18230501","volume":"8","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"HANDX: a model-based system for automatic segmentation of bones from digital hand radiographs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HANDX: a model-based system for automatic segmentation of bones from digital hand radiographs","sourcePdf":"00020363.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032795S","chronDate":"March  1989","isNumber":"811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"60","articleId":"20363","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":20365,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, USA"],"lastName":"Ying Sun","id":"37087147526"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0062"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-254X"}],"articleNumber":"20365","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":140,"citationCountPatent":15,"totalDownloads":598},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spatial resolution","Arteries","Algorithm design and analysis","Blood vessels","Biomedical imaging","Automation","High-resolution imaging","Matched filters","Robustness","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cardiology","diagnostic radiography","medical diagnostic computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vessel orientation","vessel contours identification","coronary arteriograms","adaptive tracking algorithm","incremental sections","geometric similarity","filter parameters","synthetic images","digital subtraction angiograms","cineangiograms","lumen width","percent stenosis","dynamic range","background variation","blurring"]}],"abstract":"A tracking algorithm for identification of vessel contours in digital coronary arteriograms was developed and validated. Given an initial start-of-search point, the tracking process was fully automated by utilizing the spatial continuity of the vessel's centerline, orientation, diameter, and density. The incremental sections along a major vessel were sequentially identified, based on the assumptions of geometric similarity and continuation between adjacent incremental sections. The algorithm consisted of an extrapolation-update process which was guided by a matched filter. The filter parameters were adapted to the measured lumen width. The tracking process was robust and extremely efficient as indicated by test results on synthetic images, digital subtraction angiograms, and cineangiograms.

A source-follower circuit is described that provides an output voltage dependent on the threshold-voltage variations of the sensing transistor.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/55.20408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=814","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/55.20408","endPage":"46","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel1/55/814/00020408.pdf","startPage":"44","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A process for the combined fabrication of ion sensors and CMOS circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/20408/","displayDocTitle":"A process for the combined fabrication of ion sensors and CMOS circuits","volume":"9","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"3110488","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1988","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A process for the combined fabrication of ion sensors and CMOS circuits","sourcePdf":"00020408.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099021S","chronDate":"Jan.  1988","isNumber":"814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"53","articleId":"20408","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":20418,"authors":[{"name":"J.B.

The error component, named the combined cell-bit line (CCB) failure mode, occurs when the cell and the bit line each collect radiation-induced charge which are individually insufficient to upset the cell, but which does cause an error in combination. Experimental results covering the three soft-error rate (SER) components (cell, bit line, and CCB) have been obtained using an Americium-241 source, over a wide range of cycle times from 75 ns to 30 mu s. The study indicates that, at short cycle times, CCB failure mode can dominate SER in high-density, high-speed dynamic memories.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00020423.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel1/55/815/00020423.pdf","startPage":"644","endPage":"646","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","doi":"10.1109/55.20423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/55.20423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=815","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=20423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new failure mode of radiation-induced soft errors in dynamic memories","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error analysis","Random access memory","Time measurement","Numerical simulation","MOS capacitors","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["alpha-particle effects","failure analysis","integrated circuit testing","integrated memory circuits","MOS integrated circuits","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combined cell-bit line failure mode","MOS circuits","alpha particle irradiation","failure mode","radiation-induced soft errors","dynamic memories","DRAM","radiation-induced charge","cycle times","75 ns to 30 mus"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/20423/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1988","displayDocTitle":"A new failure mode of radiation-induced soft errors in dynamic memories","volume":"9","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1988","accessionNumber":"3310553","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new failure mode of radiation-induced soft errors in dynamic memories","sourcePdf":"00020423.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059528S","chronDate":"Dec.  1988","isNumber":"815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"20","articleId":"20423","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":20424,"authors":[{"name":"U.K. Mishra","affiliation":["Hughes Res.

These sensors operate on optical principles involving the frustration of total internal reflection at a waveguide/elastomer interface and produce a grey-scale tactile image that represents the normal (vertical) forces of contact. The first tactile sensor discussed is a compact, 32*32 planar sensor array intended for mounting on a parallel-jaw gripper. Optical fibers were employed to convey the tactile image to a CCD camera and microprocessor-based image analysis system. The second sensor had the shape and size of a human fingertip and was designed for a dexterous robotic hand. It contained 257 sensing sites (taxels) distributed in a dual-density pattern that included a tactile fovea near the tip measuring 13*13 mm and containing 169 taxels. The design and construction details of these tactile sensors are presented, in addition to photographs of tactile imprints.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/20431/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1988","publicationDate":"Oct. 1988","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3300557","volume":"4","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Planar and finger-shaped optical tactile sensors for robotic applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Planar and finger-shaped optical tactile sensors for robotic applications","sourcePdf":"00020431.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047291S","chronDate":"Oct 1988","isNumber":"816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"56","citationCount":"113","articleId":"20431","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":20435,"authors":[{"name":"S.-R.

The aim is to generate open-loop (i.e. sensorless) strategies which succeed in aligning or grasping a workpiece, in the face of two kinds of uncertainty: (1) the initial configuration of the workpiece may have some bounded error, and (2) the details of the contact between workpiece and work surface may be unknown, precluding deterministic solution for the motion of the workpiece even were its initial configuration exactly known. Configuration maps are defined which map all configurations of a workpiece before elementary manipulative operation to all possible outcomes. Using elementary manipulative operations (represented by configuration maps) as primitives, appropriate search techniques are applied to find operations sequences which are guaranteed to succeed despite uncertainty. As a concrete example, the authors demonstrate the automated design of a class of passive parts-feeder consisting of multiple sequential fences across a conveyor belt.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/56.20437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/56.20437","endPage":"531","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel1/56/816/00020437.pdf","startPage":"524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Planning robotic manipulation strategies for workpieces that slide","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/20437/","displayDocTitle":"Planning robotic manipulation strategies for workpieces that slide","volume":"4","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"3300563","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1988","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Planning robotic manipulation strategies for workpieces that slide","sourcePdf":"00020437.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080373S","chronDate":"Oct 1988","isNumber":"816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"56","citationCount":"119","articleId":"20437","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":20439,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

The efforts have concentrated on the geometric design of the projectional grid with regard to smoothing of fine-scale range texture, and the development of image processing techniques in order to extract the deformed grid from the image. Particular emphasis is placed on the issues of operating in ambient lighting, smoothing of range texture, grid pattern selection, albedo normalization, grid extraction, and coarse registration of images to the projected grid. Once the grid is extracted, its global order allows intersections to be labeled, and disparities assigned and converted to range data. This range map can then be converted to a 'topography map' to be used for planning short-range paths through the environment while avoiding obstacles.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/20439/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1988","volume":"4","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1988","accessionNumber":"3300565","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Structured light patterns for robot mobility","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structured light patterns for robot mobility","sourcePdf":"00020439.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037334S","chronDate":"Oct 1988","isNumber":"816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"56","citationCount":"31","articleId":"20439","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":20440,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

A new algorithm for choosing suitable sets of code sequences is presented and a new class of code sequences for use with an optimum matched filter detector in a CDMA system is described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Second IEE National Conference on Telecommunications 1989","pdfPath":"/iel3/1233/823/00020692.pdf","startPage":"111","endPage":"115","publicationTitle":"Second IEE National Conference on Telecommunications 1989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=823","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=20692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code-division multiple-access (CDMA) techniques in optical fibre LANs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Code division multiaccess","Local area networks","Optical fibers","Protocols","Spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","local area networks","optical fibres","optical links","protocols","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fibre LANs","direct-sequence baseband spread-spectrum","sequence inversion keying","unipolar code sequences","CDMA protocol","mathematical model","optical CDMA system","performance measures","algorithm","optimum matched filter detector"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/20692/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Apr 1989","displayDocTitle":"Code-division multiple-access (CDMA) techniques in optical fibre LANs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3429068","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-5 April 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code-division multiple-access (CDMA) techniques in optical fibre LANs","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"00020692.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02801S","chronDate":"2-5 Apr 1989","isNumber":"823","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1233","citationCount":"2","articleId":"20692","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":20764,"authors":[{"name":"V.F.

Since phase margin is small at the 3rd and 5th order loops they are not suitable in instances where a transportation delay is present. Their advantage is a rather large attenuation at high normalized frequencies, i.e. x>>1. On the other hand the 4th order loops with their large phase margin are rather insensitive to additional transportation delay.

The TReD uses dual-port dynamic RAM cells, one port of which is assigned for a refresh operation and the other port is assigned for a normal read/write operation. Using the configuration, users of the RAM are freed from a cumbersome refresh control without access-time degradation. The TReD cell size is about 1/2.5 of a 4-transistor SRAM (static RAM) cell, so that it can provide very-high-density RAM macros, which is functionally static. As a dual-port memory, the proposed dual-port DRAM cell size is 1/5 of the dual-port SRAM cell, and is suitable for large-scale dual-port memory macros in ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) environments.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CICC.1988.20796","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00020796.png","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1988 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1988 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/737/826/00020796.pdf","startPage":"4.3/1","endPage":"4.3/4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.1988.20796","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transparent-refresh DRAM (TReD) using dual-port DRAM cell","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","conferenceDate":"16-19 May 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/20796/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 May 1988","displayDocTitle":"Transparent-refresh DRAM (TReD) using dual-port DRAM cell","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3238711","publicationDate":"1988","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transparent-refresh DRAM (TReD) using dual-port DRAM cell","confLoc":"Rochester, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00020796.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039447S","chronDate":"16-19 May 1988","isNumber":"826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"737","citationCount":"8","articleId":"20796","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":20800,"authors":[{"name":"T.S.

Connections to each node are implemented with multiplying D/A converters. The weights are stored in dynamic RAM registers at each connection. The design minimizes circuit area by using unary encoding in the weight representation to permit the use of shift operations in the adaption process and by sharing the circuits used in weight adaptation and the activation computations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CICC.1988.20838","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00020838.png","startPage":"10.3/1","endPage":"10.3/5","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1988 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/737/826/00020838.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1988 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.1988.20838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A self-organizing neural net chip","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Circuits","Algorithm design and analysis","Euclidean distance","Lifting equipment","Laboratories","Clustering algorithms","DRAM chips","Registers","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","learning systems","microprocessor chips","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microprocessor chips","self-organizing neural net chip","competitive learning process","squared Euclidean distance","multiplying D/A converters","dynamic RAM registers","unary encoding","shift operations","weight adaptation","activation computations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/20838/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 May 1988","displayDocTitle":"A self-organizing neural net chip","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-19 May 1988","accessionNumber":"3257494","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A self-organizing neural net chip","confLoc":"Rochester, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00020838.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.141483S","chronDate":"16-19 May 1988","isNumber":"826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"737","citationCount":"20","articleId":"20838","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":20850,"authors":[{"name":"J.

All the loopholes are related to one or more of three fundamental environmental characteristics. First, mixed-signal ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) components lack the controllability and observability seen at old component/card test levels. Second, there is much closer interaction between the logic and analog portions of a design. Third, design and product life cycles are being compressed to the point where existing card and component test methodologies and processes no longer meet requirements. He shows that the key development that will lead to significant improvements in mixed signal test methodologies is the most recent generation of mixed-signal, digital signal processor (DSP)-based tester/work stations. Particularly important is computer-automated design software that these systems provide, which may establish a better environment for design-for-test and test generation development.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CICC.1988.20880","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1988 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1988 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/737/826/00020880.pdf","startPage":"16.4/1","endPage":"16.4/5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.1988.20880","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 May 1988","displayDocTitle":"The loophole in logic test: mixed signal ASIC","conferenceDate":"16-19 May 1988","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3257536","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/20880/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The loophole in logic test: mixed signal ASIC","confLoc":"Rochester, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00020880.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026323S","chronDate":"16-19 May 1988","isNumber":"826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"737","citationCount":"11","articleId":"20880","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":20881,"authors":[{"name":"P.P.

Two conditions, observability and constructability, which have to be satisfied for this to be feasible are identified. One approach for accomplishing this task is to develop an augmented system model which captures both nominal and perturbed system behaviour. For the case of systems with Markov properties, an explicit methodology is presented for constructing such models. It is also shown that by an observability transformation it is generally possible to satisfy constructability conditions allowing the performance of a perturbed discrete event system to be estimated by observing only a nominal sample path. In practice, a variety of techniques may be used to accomplish this goal, depending on issues such as parameter value availability and convergence speed of various performance sensitivity, estimates.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.21070","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.21070","startPage":"59","endPage":"71","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/859/00021070.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sample path properties of timed discrete event systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Sample path properties of timed discrete event systems","publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"77","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3387054","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/21070/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sample path properties of timed discrete event systems","sourcePdf":"00021070.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031771S","chronDate":"Jan.  1989","isNumber":"859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"38","articleId":"21070","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":21072,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.G.

At each level, feedback laws select times for the controllable events whose frequency class is treated at that level and frequency targets for much higher-frequency controllable events.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical flow control: a framework for scheduling and planning discrete events in manufacturing systems","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/5.21079","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/859/00021079.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.21079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=859","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=21079","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/21079/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical flow control: a framework for scheduling and planning discrete events in manufacturing systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"77","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","accessionNumber":"3387062","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical flow control: a framework for scheduling and planning discrete events in manufacturing systems","sourcePdf":"00021079.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040057S","chronDate":"Jan.  1989","isNumber":"859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"179","articleId":"21079","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":21085,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

Parallel test algorithms for RAMs have been developed on the basis of this design-for-testability approach for a broad class of pattern-sensitive faults. Two algorithms which are significantly more efficient than previous approaches are examined. The first algorithm detects the static and dynamic pattern-sensitive faults over a neighborhood of five cells. The second algorithm tests the symmetric pattern-sensitive faults over a neighborhood of nine cells. It tests an n-bit RAM organized as a square root n* square root n array in 97 square root n memory cycles. The design-for-testability approach modifies the existing RAM architecture very little, so that it can be implemented very easily. The additional overhead is only about 2 square root n transistors. The low overhead allows high reliability, and the additional circuit for each bit line can fit within the 3 lambda -to-6 lambda pitch width in a high-density, single-transistor dynamic RAM. Although the algorithm is designed to detect pattern-sensitive faults, the modified architecture can be readily used to speed up other conventional algorithms of linear complexity by a factor of O( square root n).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel testing for pattern-sensitive faults in semiconductor random-access memories","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/12.21126","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/861/00021126.pdf","startPage":"394","endPage":"407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.21126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=861","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=21126","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/21126/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1989","displayDocTitle":"Parallel testing for pattern-sensitive faults in semiconductor random-access memories","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1989","accessionNumber":"3375876","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel testing for pattern-sensitive faults in semiconductor random-access memories","sourcePdf":"00021126.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046663S","chronDate":"Mar 1989","isNumber":"861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"31","articleId":"21126","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":21131,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Specifically, it is assumed that a PRN of unrestricted topology is given, including a set of users, a set of channels, a set of interference links, a frequency band assignment, and an initial link schedule. It is required that any link schedule satisfies two constraints. The first is the transmission/reception constraint, namely that users cannot transmit and receive simultaneously and cannot transmit/receive more than one packet at a time. The second is the interference-free constraint, namely that no user interferes with any other. It is assumed that the initial link schedule satisfies the transmission/reception constraint, but not necessarily the interference-free constraint. Then it is shown that a simple modification of the initial link is needed to satisfy the latter constraint as well, i.e. the two constraints can be decoupled.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.21132","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/861/00021132.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=861","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.21132","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"455","endPage":"458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoupling link scheduling constraints in multi-hop packet radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=21132","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1989","displayDocTitle":"Decoupling link scheduling constraints in multi-hop packet radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/21132/","volume":"38","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1989","accessionNumber":"3375878","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoupling link scheduling constraints in multi-hop packet radio networks","sourcePdf":"00021132.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042132S","chronDate":"Mar 1989","isNumber":"861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"29","articleId":"21132","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":21135,"authors":[{"name":"V.K.P.

The technique is used to improve systolic algorithms for some matrix computations on linearly connected arrays of PEs (processor elements) with constant I/O bandwidth. The important features of these designs are modularity with constant hardware in each PE, few control lines, simple data-input/output format, and improved delay time. This technique is extended to design an optimal n square root n-time systolic algorithm for n*n matrix multiplication with O( square root n) I/O bandwidth requirement on a fault-tolerant VLSI model. In this model, the propagation delay is assumed to be proportional to wire length. Fault reconfiguration is achieved by using buffers to bypass faulty PEs, which does not affect the clock rate of the system. The unidirectional flow of control and data assures correctness of the algorithm in the presence of faulty PEs. The design can be implemented on reconfigurable fault-tolerant VLSI arrays using the Diogenes methodology. The present designs are compared to those in the literature and are shown to be superior with respect to I/O format, control, and delay from input to output.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On mapping algorithms to linear and fault-tolerant systolic arrays","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/12.21135","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/861/00021135.pdf","startPage":"470","endPage":"478","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.21135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=861","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=21135","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/21135/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1989","displayDocTitle":"On mapping algorithms to linear and fault-tolerant systolic arrays","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1989","accessionNumber":"3375879","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On mapping algorithms to linear and fault-tolerant systolic arrays","sourcePdf":"00021135.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059222S","chronDate":"Mar 1989","isNumber":"861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"16","articleId":"21135","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":21141,"authors":[{"name":"G.S.

They suggest a scheme that allows a cache to continue operation in the presence of defective/faulty blocks. Results are presented of an extensive trace-driven simulation analysis that evaluates the performance degradation of a cache due to defective blocks. From the results it is seen that the on-chip caches of VLSI processors can be organized so that the performance degradation due to a few defective blocks is negligible.

It is shown that a coupling fault is repaired if its coupling cell is replaced by utilizing a spare row or its coupled cell is replaced by utilizing a spare row or column. By specifying both the coupled cell and coupling cell, the amount of redundancy required to repair a given set of faults may be reduced.

A reconfigurability theorem is developed to provide the theoretical footing for novel reconfiguration algorithms for the fabrication-time and run-time processing. For fabrication-time yield enhancement, the problem of finding a feasible reconfiguration using global control can be reformulated as a maximum independent set problem. An existing algorithm in graph theory is adopted to solve this problem. The simulations conducted indicate that the algorithm is computationally very efficient; therefore, it may also be applicable to certain run-time fault tolerance. In real-time fault tolerance, the propagation time of data/control signals between the host computer incurred in the global control is often prohibitively long; therefore, only distributed processing is feasible. Based on the same reconfigurability theorem, a distributive reconfiguration algorithm is developed for (asynchronous) array processors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault-tolerant array processors using single-track switches","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/12.21143","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/862/00021143.pdf","startPage":"501","endPage":"514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.21143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=862","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=21143","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/21143/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1989","displayDocTitle":"Fault-tolerant array processors using single-track switches","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1989","accessionNumber":"3383662","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault-tolerant array processors using single-track switches","sourcePdf":"00021143.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058001S","chronDate":"Apr 1989","isNumber":"862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"121","articleId":"21143","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":21144,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.

Worst-case performance bounds for detecting the presence of a pattern class are derived.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Detectors","Stochastic resonance","Noise robustness","Additive noise","Bayesian methods","Signal detection","Working environment noise","Minimax techniques","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","signal detection","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic multisample extension","Morris's robust detector","bounded amplitude noise","Bayesian approach","finite sample detection","unknown noise environment","constant signal"]}],"doi":"10.1109/18.21220","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00021220.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/865/00021220.pdf","startPage":"973","endPage":"978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.21220","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A stochastic multisample extension of Morris's robust detector in bounded amplitude noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=21220","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A stochastic multisample extension of Morris's robust detector in bounded amplitude noise","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/21220/","volume":"34","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1988","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3375767","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1988","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A stochastic multisample extension of Morris's robust detector in bounded amplitude noise","sourcePdf":"00021220.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034615S","chronDate":"Sept.  1988","isNumber":"865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"3","articleId":"21220","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":21223,"authors":[{"name":"Chein-I Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Chein-I Chang","id":"37087146685"},{"name":"L.D.

In terms of joint power-bandwidth performance, it is found that coded eight-level systems are better than coded four-level systems and that partial-response signalling is better than full-response signalling. In general, the price paid for better performance is increased receiver complexity. Heuristic design rules have been used to find good codes for CPM. In most cases the coding gains found are identical to published results that were generated by exhaustive search, indicating that the choice of design rules is quite appropriate. In the present study bandwidth efficiency is considered from both the 99% and 99.9% power-bandwidth points of view. It is found that partial-response signalling is even more jointly power and bandwidth efficient for the latter than for the former bandwidth criterion.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Continuous phase modulation","Bandwidth","Phase modulation","Partial response signaling","Maximum likelihood detection","Maximum likelihood estimation","Convolutional codes","Convolution","Signal detection","Global communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","phase modulation","signalling (telecommunication networks)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heuristic design","spectrum","distance","receiver complexity","encoded continuous phase modulation","joint power-bandwidth performance","eight-level systems","four-level systems","partial-response signalling","full-response signalling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/18.21225","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00021225.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/865/00021225.pdf","startPage":"1021","endPage":"1032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.21225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum, distance, and receiver complexity of encoded continuous phase modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=21225","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum, distance, and receiver complexity of encoded continuous phase modulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/21225/","volume":"34","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1988","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3375772","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1988","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum, distance, and receiver complexity of encoded continuous phase modulation","sourcePdf":"21225.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031725S","chronDate":"Sept.  1988","isNumber":"865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"19","articleId":"21225","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":21228,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

The family of Barnes-Wall lattices (including D/sub 4/ and E/sub 8/) of lengths N=2/sup n/ and their principal sublattices, which are useful in constructing coset codes, are generated by iteration of a simple construction called the squaring construction. The closely related Reed-Muller codes are generated by the same construction. The principal properties of these codes and lattices are consequences of the general properties of iterated squaring constructions, which also exhibit the interrelationships between codes and lattices of different lengths. An extension called the cubing construction generates good codes and lattices of lengths N=3*2/sup n/, including the Golay code and Leech lattice, with the use of special bases for 8-space. Another related construction generates the Nordstrom-Robinson code and an analogous 16-dimensional nonlattice packing. These constructions are represented by trellis diagrams that display their structure and interrelationships and that lead to efficient maximum-likelihood decoding algorithms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.21246","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/865/00021246.pdf","startPage":"1152","endPage":"1187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.21246","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00021246.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coset codes.

A subset of the Leech lattice can be used as a signal set for the Gaussian channel or as representative vectors for a vector quantizer. Of particular interest are the spherical codes (or code books) that consist of the points of the Leech lattice which lie on a sphere centered at the origin. The code points do not have to be stored because they can be obtained from a very small set of basic vectors using permutations of the components in a manner dictated by the words of the extended Golay code.

A general algorithm is proposed for this purpose and applied to one class of coded modulations. Using a frequency-domain interpretation of the Euclidean distance, it is shown that under extreme channel band limitations, the error event that causes the minimum distance is characterized by a spectral null at DC. Numerical results show that for filtered continuous-phase-modulation codes, decreasing the modulation index or smoothing the frequency pulse does not improve the error performance. For some of these modulations, channel filtering can actually improve the minimum distance. Bandpass and low-pass filtering are contrasted.

Using classical real analysis and the ergodic theorem, convergence of the sample encoding distortion and its partial derivatives (with respect to the code quantization levels) to their ensemble average values is investigated. It is found that in the common code design situation, the expected per-symbol distortion and its first derivatives are available and piecewise continuous, but second-derivative information is unreliable. This indicates that efficient optimization should be performed using a nonderivative or first-derivative method that does not compute approximate second derivatives to determine search directions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.21250","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00021250.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/865/00021250.pdf","startPage":"1226","endPage":"1241","doi":"10.1109/18.21250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trellis source code design as an optimization problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1988","displayDocTitle":"Trellis source code design as an optimization problem","volume":"34","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1988","accessionNumber":"3375795","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/21250/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1988","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trellis source code design as an optimization problem","sourcePdf":"00021250.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035124S","chronDate":"Sept.  1988","isNumber":"865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"5","articleId":"21250","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":21252,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

These systems, while not optimal, can have asymptotic performance arbitrarily close to the optimum. Their analysis and implementation can be simpler than those of optimal systems.

It is assumed that the channel is an additive white Gaussian noise channel and that the receiver performs coherent maximum-likelihood sequence detection by means of the Viterbi algorithm. An upper bound on the bit error probability is derived, using the average generating function technique, and evaluated numerically for a number of coded multilevel full-response CPM schemes. Simulation results are also presented. It is concluded that the free Euclidean distance is the best one-parameter description of the error probability for the considered class of signals for high signal-to-noise ratios.

No assumptions about the structure of the noise at the output of the post-detection filter are required. However, it is assumed that the Gaussian noise at the input is generated by passing white noise through the bandpass equivalent of a single-pole low-pass filter. Hence, the noise is a two-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck or Gauss-Markov process. In practice, a higher-order bandpass filter would be encountered in FM reception. However, the approach is intended as a first step towards the goal of an understanding of the phase process. The method used is to derive and solve the Fokker-Planck partial differential equation that governs the joint distribution. An explicit integral formula for the solution is obtained. The integral is, in general, rather difficult to evaluate. A further integration over amplitude is required if the angle distribution rather than the joint distribution is required. For some special-cases, where the filtering time is large and the signal-to-noise power ratio is very large or very small, explicit approximate expressions are given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/21277/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1988","accessionNumber":"3393609","volume":"34","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The distribution of the amplitude and continuous phase of a sinusoid in noise","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The distribution of the amplitude and continuous phase of a sinusoid in noise","sourcePdf":"00021277.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053407S","chronDate":"Nov 1988","isNumber":"866","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"6","articleId":"21277","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":21279,"authors":[{"name":"N.M.

The standard phase noise model is a Brownian-motion stochastic process. Although many analyses of lightwave communication systems have been published, none, to the authors knowledge, has fully adhered to the standard model. The reason is that a proper characterization of filtered lightwave signal had not been achieved. Such a characterization, along with theoretical approaches to obtaining it, is detailed. The authors show, for example, how to generate probability density functions (PDFs) of the magnitude of a filtered laser tone (with special attention to the tail region) and how to analytically represent the characteristic function of the PDF in closed form in the small-phase-noise realm. With the characterization in place, the stage is now set for determining the bit-error rate performance of advanced detection techniques which seek to mitigate the phase noise impairment.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.21283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=866","startPage":"1437","endPage":"1448","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/866/00021283.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterizing filtered light waves corrupted by phase noise","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/21283/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1988","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Characterizing filtered light waves corrupted by phase noise","publicationDate":"Nov. 1988","accessionNumber":"3393615","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"34","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterizing filtered light waves corrupted by phase noise","sourcePdf":"00021283.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061751S","chronDate":"Nov 1988","isNumber":"866","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"153","articleId":"21283","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":21284,"authors":[{"name":"A.D.

The demodulator output is the magnitude of the filtered signal for an AM receiver or its phase for a PM receiver. For such a system with amplitude demodulation, the results are found and presented in the form of an expansion in which the leading term is the linear (i.e., undistorted) reproduction of the input AM and the successive terms represent the distortion and crossmodulation. The significant effects are given by the first few terms of the expansion because the applications of interest are those in which the distortion is small. A spectral analysis is performed on the output of an AM receiver. The leading DC, linear, and nonlinear terms of the output power spectrum are derived by assuming that the amplitude- and phase-modulating signals are uncorrelated zero-mean random Gaussian processes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=866","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.21286","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00021286.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/866/00021286.pdf","startPage":"1472","endPage":"1482","doi":"10.1109/18.21286","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplitude demodulation of filtered AM/PM signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1988","displayDocTitle":"Amplitude demodulation of filtered AM/PM signals","volume":"34","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1988","accessionNumber":"3393618","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/21286/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplitude demodulation of filtered AM/PM signals","sourcePdf":"00021286.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02209S","chronDate":"Nov 1988","isNumber":"866","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"3","articleId":"21286","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":21288,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This scheduling problem is known to be NP-complete. To achieve the minimum computation time, the Newton-Euler equations of motion are expressed in the homogeneous linear recurrence form that results in achieving maximum parallelism. To speed up the searching for a solution, a heuristic search algorithm called dynamical highest-level-first/most-immediate-successors-first (DHLF/MISF) is proposed to find a fast but suboptimal schedule.

The derived noise parameter estimation process, which uses a Gaussian elimination technique to predict the measured noise figure to within 0.2 dB, reduces a set of complex, binomial equations to simple relationships which are easily programmable.

The observed flicker phase noise was independent of input power, even at levels producing 4 dB of gain compression, and also changed very little with bias conditions. The intrinsic phase noise at temperatures below 2.17 K was slightly higher than that observed at room temperature. However, no sign of the dramatic increase in flicker phase noise at low temperatures recently reported at 9.7 GHz was observed.

Performance evaluation over 1946 testing tokens from three speakers showed that the TDNN achieves a recognition rate of 98.5% correct while the rate obtained by the best of the HMMs was only 93.7%.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/21701/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1989","volume":"37","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"3383900","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1989","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Phoneme recognition using time-delay neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phoneme recognition using time-delay neural networks","sourcePdf":"00021701.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042101S","chronDate":"Mar 1989","isNumber":"873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"1306","articleId":"21701","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":21703,"authors":[{"name":"D.T.M.

A simplified maximum-likelihood Gauss-Newton algorithm which provides asymptotically efficient estimates of these parameters is proposed. Initial estimates for this algorithm are obtained by a variation of the overdetermined Yule-Walker method and periodogram-based procedure. Use of the maximum-likelihood Gauss-Newton algorithm is not, however, limited to this particular initialization method. Some other possibilities to get suitable initial estimates are briefly discussed. An analytical and numerical study of the shape of the likelihood function associated with the sinusoids-in-noise process reveals its multimodal structure and clearly sets the importance of the initialization procedure. Some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed estimation procedure. Comparison to the performance corresponding to the Cramer-Rao lower bound is also presented, using a simple expression for the asymptotic Cramer-Rao bound covariance matrix derived in the paper.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/29.21705","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/873/00021705.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.21705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=873","startPage":"378","endPage":"392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of multiple sinusoids from noisy measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=21705","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of multiple sinusoids from noisy measurements","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/21705/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1989","accessionNumber":"3376363","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of multiple sinusoids from noisy measurements","sourcePdf":"00021705.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084505S","chronDate":"Mar 1989","isNumber":"873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"248","articleId":"21705","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":21707,"authors":[{"name":"K.D.

Hence, the computational load associated with interpolation is also reduced. For the case in which no restriction are placed on the sampling rates of the scanner, a set of projection angles along with their corresponding sampling rates are derived such that no interpolation is required to calculate the final image points for the display grid. From this result a reduced interpolation scheme is developed for the case when upper and lower bounds exist on the sampling rates. The choice of an optimal set of projection that will maintain an image quality comparable to a sampling scheme of regular measurement geometry, while minimizing the computational load is discussed. The Cartesian-grid scanning and sampling (CGSS) scheme developed is compared to a sampling scheme of regular measurement geometry through a computer simulation. The results demonstrate that for higher sampling rates and images of limited pixel dimension, the CGSS scheme can reduce the computational load of the reconstruction process and maintain comparable image quality.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=873","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.21707","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/873/00021707.pdf","startPage":"402","endPage":"414","doi":"10.1109/29.21707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A scanning and sampling scheme for computationally efficient algorithms of computer tomography","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1989","displayDocTitle":"A scanning and sampling scheme for computationally efficient algorithms of computer tomography","volume":"37","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1989","accessionNumber":"3383901","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/21707/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A scanning and sampling scheme for computationally efficient algorithms of computer tomography","sourcePdf":"00021707.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038885S","chronDate":"Mar 1989","isNumber":"873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"1","articleId":"21707","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":21708,"authors":[{"name":"N.P.

Petri net invariants are used by the algorithms to reduce the time and space complexities associated with dynamic Petri net analysis (i.e. reachability graph generation).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/21759/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3366720","displayDocTitle":"Detection of Ada static deadlocks using Petri net invariants","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Ada static deadlocks using Petri net invariants","sourcePdf":"00021759.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030173S","chronDate":"Mar 1989","isNumber":"876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"118","articleId":"21759","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":21762,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The problem consists of labeling connected components in N/sup 1/2/*N/sup 2/2/ binary images. This task can be solved with parallel computers by using a simple and novel algorithm. The parallel computing model used is a synchronous fine-grained shared-memory model where only one processor can read from or write to the same memory location at a given time. This model is known as the exclusive-read exclusive-write parallel RAM (EREW PRAM). Using this model, the algorithm presented has O(log N) complexity.

Because of the high cost of packaging, the testing stage prior to aging, called wafer probe, is key in reducing the overall manufacturing cost. Typically in this stage, specification tests are performed. Even though specification tests can certainly distinguish a good circuit from all faulty ones, they are expensive, and many types of faulty behavior can be detected by simpler tests. The construction of a set of measurements that detects many faulty circuits before specification testing is described. Bounds on these measurements are specified, and an algorithm for test selection is presented. An example of a possible simple test is a test of DC voltages (i.e., parametric tests). This type of test is defined rigorously, and its effectiveness in detecting faulty circuits is evaluated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/21830/","volume":"8","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"3352504","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Detection of catastrophic faults in analog integrated circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of catastrophic faults in analog integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"00021830.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158214S","chronDate":"Feb 1989","isNumber":"882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"177","articleId":"21830","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":21835,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The result is a unified BIST scheme (UBIST), allowing high fault coverage for all tests needed for integrated circuits, e.g., offline test (design verification, manufacturing test, maintenance test) and online concurrent error detection. An important concept introduced is that of self-exercising checkers.

Utilizing the parasitic associated with the diode stored charge, it is shown that the diode reverse current established for charge removal can be used advantageously to accomplish soft switching. The entire family of single-transistor DC/DC converters can be realized using the technique. The converter topologies are seen to differ from their hard-switched counterparts only by the presence of a resonant capacitor. It is also shown that device and component stresses are moderate as compared to existing quasi-resonant and resonant techniques. Converter analysis is rather complex as a result of the dominant diode nonlinearities, and no closed-form expressions are possible. Converter transfer characteristics are obtained through simulation, and operating limits are analytically obtained. The concept is validated by experimental results using buck-type converters rated at approximately 100 W and operating at frequencies around 1 MHz.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/21868/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1989","volume":"4","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3377624","publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","displayDocTitle":"Diodes as pseudo-active elements in high-frequency DC/DC converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diodes as pseudo-active elements in high-frequency DC/DC converters","sourcePdf":"00021868.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026328S","chronDate":"Jan.  1989","isNumber":"885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"19","articleId":"21868","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":21869,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The converter can operate under safe conditions for load resistances ranging from a full load to an open circuit. This feature has been obtained by using an inductive impedance inverter. The results of the analysis are then generalized for the entire family of class E DC/DC converters. Experimental results show good agreement with the theoretical predictions.

The central concept of generic tasks is what input-output behavior (i.e. that task function), knowledge needed to perform the task, and inferences appropriate for the task are all specified together.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/64.21896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=887","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/64.21896","endPage":"15","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00021896.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Expert","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Expert","pdfPath":"/iel3/64/887/00021896.pdf","startPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Explaining control strategies in problem solving","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Spring  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Spring  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/21896/","displayDocTitle":"Explaining control strategies in problem solving","volume":"4","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"3385358","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Spring 1989","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Explaining control strategies in problem solving","sourcePdf":"00021896.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118805S","chronDate":"Spring  1989","isNumber":"887","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"64","citationCount":"53","articleId":"21896","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":21907,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The feasibility and expected performance of the resulting hybrid network are examined. CDMA (code-division multiple access) is used to eliminate the need for laser frequency control, which is required for pure FDMA (frequency-division multiaccess) schemes. On the other hand, an FDMA-like mutual avoidance scheme exploits the limited tunability available to keep signals away from one another as much as possible, relieving the need for CDMA to protect against more than the occasional crossover of one interfering signal. This significantly limits the amount of spectral spreading required. The use of the hybrid network for high-bit-rate and low-bit-rate applications is discussed. The power budget for a local network utilizing a star coupler is outlined.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/65.21907","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","pdfPath":"/iel3/65/888/00021907.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"30","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00021907.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/65.21907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining frequency-division and code-division multiplexing in a high-capacity optical network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=21907","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/21907/","displayDocTitle":"Combining frequency-division and code-division multiplexing in a high-capacity optical network","volume":"3","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1989","accessionNumber":"3377827","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining frequency-division and code-division multiplexing in a high-capacity optical network","sourcePdf":"00021907.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107838S","chronDate":"March  1989","isNumber":"888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"32","articleId":"21907","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":21908,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

Fiber-optic CDMA systems in which incoherent optical signal processing techniques are used to establish optical CDMA systems are first examined. In particular, a novel class of sequences for incoherent fiber-optic CDMA systems, called optical orthogonal codes, are discussed.

The problem of deciding whether a graph can be embedded in 3-space so that no collection of vertex-disjoint cycles is topologically linked is considered first. The Robertson-Seymour Theory of Graph Minors is applicable to this problem and guarantees the existence of an O(n/sup 3/) algorithm for the decision problem. However, not even a finite-time decision procedure was known for this problem. A small set of forbidden minors for linkless embeddable graphs is exhibited, and it is shown that any graph with these minors cannot be embedded without linked cycles. It is further established that any graph that does not contain these minors is embeddable without linked cycles. Thus, an O(n/sup 3/) algorithm for the decision problem is demonstrated. It is believed that the proof technique will lead to an algorithm for actually embedding a graph, provided it does not contain the forbidden minors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SFCS.1988.21956","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1988] 29th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1988] 29th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","pdfPath":"/iel2/219/889/00021956.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SFCS.1988.21956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=889","startPage":"398","endPage":"409","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00021956.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constructive results from graph minors: linkless embeddings","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=21956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Constructive results from graph minors: linkless embeddings","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Oct 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/21956/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Oct. 1988","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3328848","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constructive results from graph minors: linkless embeddings","confLoc":"White Plains, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00021956.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038029S","chronDate":"24-26 Oct 1988","isNumber":"889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"219","citationCount":"9","articleId":"21956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":21958,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The program uses the method of nonlinear currents and a nodal formulation. In this approach, each nonlinear circuit element is described as a linear element in parallel with a set of current sources; each current source represents a single order (greater than one) of the mixing products, and its current is a nonlinear function of the node-voltage components at lower-order mixing frequencies. The weakly nonlinear circuit is reduced to a linear circuit, which contains the linear elements and the linear parts of the nonlinear elements, and a set of excitation sources. The program is intended primarily for use in the design of microwave circuits; its catalog of circuit elements includes the distributed elements necessary for such work. Because the program formulates and solves the circuit equations numerically, the user need not simplify either the circuit or the model of the solid-state device, or make any of the other common simplifying assumptions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1988.22038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=890","startPage":"311","endPage":"314 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"1988., IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel2/707/890/00022038.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A general-purpose computer program for the Volterra-series analysis of nonlinear microwave circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/22038/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 1988","displayDocTitle":"A general-purpose computer program for the Volterra-series analysis of nonlinear microwave circuits","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 1988","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3257607","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A general-purpose computer program for the Volterra-series analysis of nonlinear microwave circuits","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00022038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030391S","chronDate":"25-27 May 1988","isNumber":"890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"707","citationCount":"34","articleId":"22038","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":22039,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The filter design extends the odd mode phase length by allowing the coupled lines to overlap with lines outside the resonator proper, i.e. the coupling gap of the resonator is extended out onto the 50- Omega lines. The even-mode length has been set by the distance between the 50- Omega lines. Thus, the reference plane for the even mode has been moved into the resonator. This configuration makes the odd-mode length longer than the even mode and thus compensates for the phase velocity difference between modes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1988.22066","displayPublicationTitle":"1988., IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel2/707/890/00022066.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1988.22066","publicationTitle":"1988., IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","startPage":"427","endPage":"430 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High performance parallel coupled microstrip filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=22066","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 1988","displayDocTitle":"High performance parallel coupled microstrip filters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/22066/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3257635","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High performance parallel coupled microstrip filters","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00022066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02286S","chronDate":"25-27 May 1988","isNumber":"890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"707","citationCount":"58","articleId":"22066","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":22074,"authors":[{"name":"M.

An efficiency of 9.5% and output power of 0.5 W were achieved at 66 GHz when the diode grid was pumped with a pulsed source at 33 GHz. The diode-grid equivalent circuit model based on a transmission-line analysis of plane-wave illumination was verified experimentally over a frequency range of 33 GHz to 140 GHz. In parallel with the diode doubler array studies, the authors investigated the use of an MOS structure having an undoped epitaxial layer, which is grown on a heavily-doped substrate and isolated by a thin oxide layer and a GaAs barrier-intrinsic-N/sup +/ (BIN) diode structure. The thin MOS concept was tested for doubling efficiency (to 95 GHz) for a variety of dot radii as a function of pump power. In support of the monolithic BIN diode array studies, a quasioptical tripler design was developed and tested. Based on the results reported, the authors are confident in predicting watt-level continuous-wave power from a monolithic-diode-grid frequency tripler design using the BIN diode concept.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/22091/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 1988","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 May 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3257657","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Watt-level millimeter-wave monolithic diode-grid frequency multipliers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Watt-level millimeter-wave monolithic diode-grid frequency multipliers","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00022091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070995S","chronDate":"25-27 May 1988","isNumber":"890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"707","citationCount":"9","articleId":"22091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":22099,"authors":[{"name":"A.E.

Such amplifiers have an input port to the gate line and an output port from the drain line. The unused gate and drain ports are terminated in the appropriate characteristic impedances. A method is presented or a dual-fed distributed amplifier, using a small number of MESFETs, in which the gain is significantly increased and the noise figure significantly reduced by feeding the signal power into both gate-line ports. Provided the amplifier operates under small-signal (linear) conditions, superposition will apply to its operation, and the output due to two forward gain signals will add to produce the total output power. This arrangement increases available gain from the amplifier in comparison with its conventional mode of operation and a concommitant reduction in noise figure. Examples verifying the design are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/22179/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 1988","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 May 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3257745","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The dual-fed distributed amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The dual-fed distributed amplifier","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00022179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027655S","chronDate":"25-27 May 1988","isNumber":"890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"707","citationCount":"25","articleId":"22179","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":22182,"authors":[{"name":"K.H.G.

The HRA is basically constructed of a pair of power FETs. The technical originality lies in the provision of an interconnecting circuit for providing an additional second-harmonic transmission path between the two FETs. These paths are designed to have impedance characteristics matched to the FETs' output impedances in the fundamental frequency band and in the second-harmonic frequency band, respectively. This additional circuit realizes the efficient and stable switching-mode operation required for highly efficient microwave power amplification. Theoretical analysis results indicate that a drain efficiency of 86% is available for an ideal HRA of purely class-B operation. Experiments on a miniaturized 2-GHz 5-W HRA module were conducted to verify analysis results. A power-added efficiency of over 70% was achieved confirming that the HRA can be applied practically to microwave power amplifiers. A HRA capability for high-efficiency operation as a linear amplifier under class-AB conditions is also shown by the experiments.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1988.22201","publicationTitle":"1988., IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"1988., IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel2/707/890/00022201.pdf","startPage":"1007","endPage":"1010 vol.2","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1988.22201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High efficiency microwave harmonic reaction amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 1988","displayDocTitle":"High efficiency microwave harmonic reaction amplifier","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 May 1988","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3257767","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/22201/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High efficiency microwave harmonic reaction amplifier","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00022201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035771S","chronDate":"25-27 May 1988","isNumber":"890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"707","citationCount":"23","articleId":"22201","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":22203,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Smith","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Smith","id":"38165140500"}],"articleNumber":"22203","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":326},"abstract":"A GaAs monolithic three-transistor signal circulator for 0.2- to 2-GHz applications was developed and tested.

The three-terminal device demonstrated a 6-dB insertion loss and an 18-dB directivity over the above frequency range.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1988., IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel2/707/890/00022203.pdf","startPage":"1015","endPage":"1016 vol.2","publicationTitle":"1988., IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1988.22203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1988.22203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=890","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=22203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GaAs monolithic implementation of active circulators","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium arsenide","Circulators","Circuit testing","FETs","Capacitors","Resistors","Integrated circuit interconnections","Capacitance","Insertion loss","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circulators (microwave)","field effect integrated circuits","gallium arsenide","III-V semiconductors","microwave integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UHF","III-V semiconductors","MMIC","gate width","submicron gate length","monolithic implementation","active circulators","three-transistor signal circulator","FETs","capacitors","resistors","high-frequency operation","insertion loss","0.2 to 2 GHz","6 dB","0.5 micron","150 micron","GaAs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/22203/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 1988","displayDocTitle":"GaAs monolithic implementation of active circulators","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3257769","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GaAs monolithic implementation of active circulators","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00022203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02833S","chronDate":"25-27 May 1988","isNumber":"890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"707","citationCount":"33","articleId":"22203","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":22222,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Based on a ceramic with an extremely high specific surface area and a metallic substrate, the ultracapacitor provides extremely high energy densities and exhibits low ESR (equivalent series resistance). The combination of low ESR and extremely low inductance provides the ultracapacitor with a very high power density and fast risetime as well. As a double-layer capacitor, the ultracapacitor is not constrained by the same limitations as dielectric capacitors. Thus, although its discharge characteristics and equivalent circuit are similar to those of dielectric capacitors, the capacitance of the ultracapacitor increases with the ceramic loading on the substrate and its ESR is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area of the device. The ultracapacitor is composed of an inline stack of electrodes, which leads to an extremely low inductance device, and it exhibits interesting frequency dependence. The ultracapacitor principle has been extended to nonaqueous electrolytes and to a wide temperature range.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=897","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/897/00022515.pdf","doi":"10.1109/20.22515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.22515","startPage":"102","endPage":"106","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Operating principles of the ultracapacitor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/22515/","displayDocTitle":"Operating principles of the ultracapacitor","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"3376052","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Operating principles of the ultracapacitor","sourcePdf":"00022515.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105223S","chronDate":"Jan.  1989","isNumber":"897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"81","articleId":"22515","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":22523,"authors":[{"name":"M.D. Driga","affiliation":["Center for Electromech., Texas Univ., Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"M.D.","lastName":"Driga","id":"37323115700"},{"name":"S.B.

It covers an extensive range of currents, voltages, pulse shapes, and also frequency in the case of multipulse generators. The compulsator embodies the single-element philosophy, combining in one element the energy storage, electromechanical energy conversion, and power conditioning. However, inside the machine such functions are done in a 'staged' manner. Two examples are given to illustrate this design philosophy: the flat pulse air-core compulsator, and the high-voltage two stage uncompensated machine (uncompulsator), which is capable of reaching voltages above 100 kV.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage","Alternators","Machinery","Pulse shaping methods","Shape","Frequency","Pulse generation","Energy storage","Energy conversion","Power conditioning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["alternators","pulse generators","pulsed power technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compulsator","compensated pulsed alternator","high-energy pulsed-power rotation machinery","multipulse generators","single-element philosophy","energy storage","electromechanical energy conversion","power conditioning","flat pulse air-core compulsator","two stage uncompensated machine","uncompulsator"]}],"doi":"10.1109/20.22523","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/897/00022523.pdf","startPage":"142","endPage":"146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=897","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.22523","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced compulsator design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=22523","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Advanced compulsator design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/22523/","volume":"25","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3393797","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced compulsator design","sourcePdf":"00022523.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027979S","chronDate":"Jan.  1989","isNumber":"897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"30","articleId":"22523","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":22562,"authors":[{"name":"G.C.

Scheduled for initial field testing in early 1989, the system will be capable of firing a salvo of nine rounds in three minutes at muzzle velocities between 2.5 and 4.0 km/s. Prime power for the compulsator is supplied by a 5000-hp gas turbine engine through a gearbox and clutch arrangement, and auxiliary power is provided by a small 750-hp turbine. Electrical power generation and pulse conditioning for the launcher are performed by the compulsator, which features a self-excited, air-core magnetic circuit and selectively passive armature compensation designed to minimize peak projectile acceleration. Peak power from the machine is 27 GW, and a total of 30 MJ is extracted from the rotor during each firing of the gun. System mass, including gun, compulsator, prime power, and auxiliary systems, is less than 22 tons and will be mounted on a 36-ton concrete slab which simulates the mass of an armored vehicle on which the system will eventually be integrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=897","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.22603","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/897/00022603.pdf","startPage":"574","endPage":"579","doi":"10.1109/20.22603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a self-excited, air-core compulsator for a skid-mounted repetitive fire 9 MJ railgun system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Design of a self-excited, air-core compulsator for a skid-mounted repetitive fire 9 MJ railgun system","volume":"25","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","accessionNumber":"3376089","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/22603/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a self-excited, air-core compulsator for a skid-mounted repetitive fire 9 MJ railgun system","sourcePdf":"00022603.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063063S","chronDate":"Jan.  1989","isNumber":"897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"16","articleId":"22603","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":23091,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The limitations and capabilities of machines are reviewed from the standpoints of computational, complexity, physical, conceptual, and conjectural limits. The old dilemmas of statistics, logic, pattern recognition, and natural language understanding are considered in this context and related to both the need for a world model and to some of the important results from algorithmic information theory. The more informal arguments against machine intelligence are also summarized, and the major problem of bridging the gap between the 'old' concept of machine and the hypothesis of artificial intelligence is again highlighted.

However, in a fuzzy production rule, the rule is executed if the degree of matching is not less than a certain matching threshold value. By using a vector representation method, the antecedent portion of the fuzzy production rule and the set of manifestations can be represented by vectors of values and features, respectively. Then, a matching function can be used to measure the degree of similarity between the vectors, and the strength of confirmation calculation method can be used on the consequence d/sub i/ caused by M.

In addition, he demonstrates the quantitive effects of taking into account radiometric considerations based on the use of Lambertian reflection properties and isotropic illumination in scene space.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.23110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.23110","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/900/00023110.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=900","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/23110/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1989","displayDocTitle":"On a constraint equation for the estimation of displacement rates in image sequences","volume":"11","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3366822","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On a constraint equation for the estimation of displacement rates in image sequences","sourcePdf":"00023110.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0256S","chronDate":"Jan 1989","isNumber":"900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"69","articleId":"23110","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":23111,"authors":[{"name":"F.Y.

The contrast of an authentic edge is shown to increase and the contrast of phantom edges to decrease with a decrease in the filter scale. Thus, a phantom edge is truly a phantom in that the closer one examines it, the weaker it becomes. The results of applying the classification schemes described to synthetic and authentic signals in one and two dimensions are given. The significance of the phantom edges is examined with respect to their frequency and strength relative to the authentic edges, and it is seen that authentic edges are denser and stronger, on the average, than phantom edges.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.23112","startPage":"43","endPage":"57","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/900/00023112.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.23112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=900","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Authenticating edges produced by zero-crossing algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Imaging phantoms","Filters","Layout","Frequency","Stereo vision","Detection algorithms","Authentication","Motion analysis","Image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern recognition","picture processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge authentication","picture processing","pattern recognition","zero-crossing edge detection algorithms","phantom edges","authentic edges"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/23112/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1989","displayDocTitle":"Authenticating edges produced by zero-crossing algorithms","volume":"11","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3366824","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Authenticating edges produced by zero-crossing algorithms","sourcePdf":"00023112.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037233S","chronDate":"Jan 1989","isNumber":"900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"145","articleId":"23112","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":23114,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

Several component processes of a recognition system for isolated offline cursive script words are described. A word image is transformed through a hierarchy of representation levels: points, contours, features, letters, and words. A unique feature representation is generated bottom-up from the image using statistical dependences between letters and features. Ratings for partially formed words are computed using a stack algorithm and a lexicon represented as a trie. Several novel techniques for low- and intermediate-level processing for cursive script are described, including heuristics for reference line finding, letter segmentation based on detecting local minima along the lower contour and areas with low vertical profiles, simultaneous encoding of contours and their topological relationships, extracting features, and finding shape-oriented events. Experiments demonstrating the performance of the system are also described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.23114","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/900/00023114.pdf","startPage":"68","endPage":"83","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.23114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=900","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Off-line cursive script word recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=23114","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/23114/","displayDocTitle":"Off-line cursive script word recognition","volume":"11","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","accessionNumber":"3366826","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Off-line cursive script word recognition","sourcePdf":"00023114.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035564S","chronDate":"Jan 1989","isNumber":"900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"292","articleId":"23114","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":23115,"authors":[{"name":"Y.T.

Specifically, the method consists of representing the pixels in a local window by a 2-D causal autoregressive (AR) model, whose parameters are adaptively estimated using a recursive least-squares algorithm. The directional derivatives are functions of parameter estimates. An edge is detected if the second derivative in the direction of the estimated maximum gradient is negatively sloped and the first directional derivative and a local estimate of variance satisfy some conditions. Because the ordered edge detector may not detect edges of all orientations well, the image scanned in four different directions, and the union of the four edge images is taken as the final output. The performance of the edge detector is illustrated using synthetic and real images. Comparisons to other edge detectors are given. A linear feature extractor that operates on the edges produced by the AR model is presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/900/00023115.pdf","startPage":"84","endPage":"95","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=900","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.23115","doi":"10.1109/34.23115","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=23115","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Feature extraction","Detectors","Face detection","Testing","Parameter estimation","Recursive estimation","Least squares approximation","Computer vision","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter estimation","pattern recognition","picture processing","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D random field model","edge detection","2D causal autoregressive model","parameter estimation","picture processing","pattern recognition","linear feature extraction","recursive least-squares algorithm","directional derivatives","edge detector"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/23115/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1989","displayDocTitle":"Edge detection and linear feature extraction using a 2-D random field model","accessionNumber":"3366827","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","volume":"11","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Edge detection and linear feature extraction using a 2-D random field model","sourcePdf":"00023115.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043553S","chronDate":"Jan 1989","isNumber":"900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"74","articleId":"23115","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":23116,"authors":[{"name":"R.

First, subpixel accuracy reconstruction is obtained by a simple linear filtering of the chain code points, which achieves a factor-of-three to-four reduction in average reconstruction distortion for smooth curves. Second, the basic chain encoding schemes are generalized to a multipath-tree-searched encoding scheme. A variation of the (M,L)-algorithm is used to maintain M contending chain code paths in storage and choose the best path from these. Over a wide variety of source curves, tree-searched chain coding results in nearly an order of magnitude reduction in average reconstruction distortion over smoother chain codes. The performance improvement for curves is obtained with only a slight increase in bit rate over basic chain codes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/900/00023116.pdf","startPage":"95","endPage":"104","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=900","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.23116","doi":"10.1109/34.23116","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=23116","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Image coding","Image edge detection","Engineering drawings","Nonlinear filters","Maximum likelihood detection","Encoding","Bayesian methods","Least squares methods","Smoothing methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised picture processing","encoding","filtering and prediction theory","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised picture processing","tree searched chain encoding","subpixel reconstruction","planar curves","quantization","line drawings","linear filtering","reconstruction distortion","chain codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/23116/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1989","displayDocTitle":"Tree searched chain coding for subpixel reconstruction of planar curves","accessionNumber":"3366828","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","volume":"11","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tree searched chain coding for subpixel reconstruction of planar curves","sourcePdf":"00023116.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045604S","chronDate":"Jan 1989","isNumber":"900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"10","articleId":"23116","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":23154,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. El-Sharkawi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"El-Sharkawi","id":"37274576300"},{"name":"M.

Speed and torque can be modulated by commutation angle control over a wide range. Combined with voltage p.w.m., sufficient flexibility is obtained by switching between a small number of modes or commutation angle combinations to at least double the speed and torque control ranges compared to those possible with fixed angles. Four-quadrant symmetrical operation is easily achieved, with extremely rapid reversing. The entire control is readily implemented using any of the normal methods (gate array, programmable logic array, custom LSI, or microprocessor).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00023367.png","displayPublicationTitle":"Third International Conference on Power Electronics and Variable-Speed Drives","pdfPath":"/iel3/1246/904/00023367.pdf","startPage":"273","endPage":"276","publicationTitle":"Third International Conference on Power Electronics and Variable-Speed Drives","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=904","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=23367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Four-quadrant brushless reluctance motor drive","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Angular velocity","Velocity control","Drives","Reluctance motors","Torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["angular velocity control","electric drives","reluctance motors","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4-quadrant brushless switched reluctance motor drive","speed control","commutation angle control","voltage p.w.m.","torque control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/23367/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Jul 1988","displayDocTitle":"Four-quadrant brushless reluctance motor drive","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3239249","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-15 July 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Four-quadrant brushless reluctance motor drive","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00023367.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04585S","chronDate":"13-15 Jul 1988","isNumber":"904","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1246","citationCount":"15","articleId":"23367","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":23368,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Several packages with different level of moisture saturation and hysteresis of moisture absorption have been heated by soldering and the occurrence of package cracking investigated. The vapor pressure and distribution of moisture content of these packages have been calculated by the present analysis. It was found that generated vapor pressure is lower than saturated vapor pressure and depends on the moisture content at the part of the plastic facing the space in which vapor pressure is generated.

The reliability performance of these memories, before program/erase cycling, matches that of UV EPROMs. Cycling generally does not introduce defect-related failures common to some EEPROMs. However, it may aggravate two intrinsic instabilities found in the UV EPROM (intrinsic charge loss and the DC program disturb mechanism). Experience shows that these are related effects caused by injection of holes during the erase step of the cycle. High source-to-substrate electric fields, during erase, generate these holes. Channel hot electron injection, for programming, plays no significant role in the observed degradation. These cycling effects can be addressed through incorporation of additional margin into the flash cell. Through such cell optimization, the reliability of these memories is made equivalent to that of conventional UV EPROMs, even after hundreds of program/erase cycles.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"26th Annual Proceedings Reliability Physics Symposium 1988","displayPublicationTitle":"26th Annual Proceedings Reliability Physics Symposium 1988","pdfPath":"/iel5/709/905/00023444.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"166","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability performance of ETOX based flash memories","doi":"10.1109/RELPHY.1988.23444","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00023444.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=905","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RELPHY.1988.23444","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=23444","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/23444/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Apr 1988","displayDocTitle":"Reliability performance of ETOX based flash memories","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3197819","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 April 1988","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability performance of ETOX based flash memories","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00023444.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039622S","chronDate":"12-14 Apr 1988","isNumber":"905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"709","citationCount":"49","articleId":"23444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":23445,"authors":[{"name":"P.L.

Units which had anomalies in the PO were found to fail rapidly with localized regions of failing bits appearing as circular areas. These circles of failed bits were found to grow in radius with the square root of time. Arrhenius plots of the rate of circular growth yielded an average value of 1.8 eV for the activation energy.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/23445/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Apr 1988","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 April 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3197820","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The impact of an external sodium diffusion source on the reliability of MOS circuitry","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The impact of an external sodium diffusion source on the reliability of MOS circuitry","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00023445.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032207S","chronDate":"12-14 Apr 1988","isNumber":"905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"709","citationCount":"8","articleId":"23445","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":23513,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The effective recording time is put to maximum use with the ability to program start and stop times on an event-by-event basis. Amplifier gains can be automatically selected based on maximum probable peak amplitudes using the automatic gain select function. The effective dynamic range of ambient-noise measurements is greatly increased using the prewhitening filter.

A weighted summation of Gaussian potential fields generated by a suitable number of GPFUs provides an arbitrary shape of a potential field over the domain of input space. The authors also present a detailed learning algorithm for the GPFN. Learning consists of the determination of the minimally necessary number of GPFUs and the adjustment of the locations and shapes of the individual Gaussian potential fields defined by GPFUs as well as the summation weights. The learning of the minimally necessary number of GPFUs is based on the control of the effective radius of GPFUs, while the parameter learning is based on the gradient descent procedure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1988.23844","pdfPath":"/iel5/763/907/00023844.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"171 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 1988 International Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE 1988 International Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1988.23844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=907","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilayer feedforward potential function network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/23844/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 July 1988","displayDocTitle":"Multilayer feedforward potential function network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3350056","publicationDate":"1988","conferenceDate":"24-27 July 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilayer feedforward potential function network","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00023844.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031964S","chronDate":"24-27 July 1988","isNumber":"907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"763","citationCount":"20","articleId":"23844","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":23845,"authors":[{"name":"Salam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Systems Science, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Salam","id":"37087574787"}],"articleNumber":"23845","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":19},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Associative memories","Neural networks","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-addressable storage","neural nets","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern recognition","content addressable storage","neural processors","neural networks","associative memories","pattern classifiers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=23845","abstract":"The author presents a mathematical framework for the design of neural networks as associative memories or as pattern classifiers.

Kosko's bidirectional associative memory (BAM) (1988) is generalized to include nonzero thresholds. This modified neural network is referred to as the nonhomogeneous BAM. It is shown that the nonhomogeneous BAM can have any number of stable states between 1 and 2/sup n/, where n is the lowest dimension of either layer of the BAM. Nonhomogeneous BAMs with 1,2, . . ., 2/sup n/-1, 2/sup n/ stable states are constructed. The storage capacity of the BAM is the number of stable states, selected by the user at random from some specified subset of stable states, that can be implemented by the BAM for some matrix selection and some set of thresholds. It is shown that the capacity of the nonhomogeneous BAM can greatly exceed the number of processing elements in the network. This is accomplished without violating information theory, because these stable states utilize a sparse code in which little information is stored in each state.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1988.23846","publicationTitle":"IEEE 1988 International Conference on Neural Networks","startPage":"181","endPage":"190 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1988.23846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=907","pdfPath":"/iel5/763/907/00023846.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 1988 International Conference on Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Associative memories","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-addressable storage","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","content addressable storage","bidirectional associative memory","neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A BAM with increased information storage capacity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/23846/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3350058","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1988","conferenceDate":"24-27 July 1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 July 1988","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A BAM with increased information storage capacity","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00023846.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024398S","chronDate":"24-27 July 1988","isNumber":"907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"763","citationCount":"48","articleId":"23846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":23849,"authors":[{"name":"Bak","affiliation":["Hughes Research Laboratories, Inc., Malibu, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Bak","id":"37087688918"},{"name":"Little","affiliation":["Hughes Research Laboratories, Inc., Malibu, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Little","id":"37087689695"}],"articleNumber":"23849","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Associative memories","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-addressable storage","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content addressable storage","artificial neural networks","high order node connections","associative memory","node-to-node interconnection schemes","storage capacity","retrieval accuracy"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=23849","abstract":"The authors have undertaken to understand and quantify the performance of artificial neural networks in the simpler and more restricted domain of associative memory.

The method is reviewed, and some recent results on image analysis are given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1988.23858","startPage":"277","endPage":"284 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 1988 International Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/763/907/00023858.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE 1988 International Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1988.23858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=907","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The subspace learning algorithm as a formalism for pattern recognition and neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Associative memories","Information theory","Learning systems","Neural networks","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-addressable storage","information theory","learning systems","neural nets","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vector subspace","subspace learning algorithm","pattern recognition","neural networks","associative memory","associative information processing","associative mappings","image analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/23858/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 July 1988","displayDocTitle":"The subspace learning algorithm as a formalism for pattern recognition and neural networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-27 July 1988","accessionNumber":"3327861","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The subspace learning algorithm as a formalism for pattern recognition and neural networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00023858.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035639S","chronDate":"24-27 July 1988","isNumber":"907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"763","citationCount":"28","articleId":"23858","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":23864,"authors":[{"name":"Sietsma","affiliation":["Materials Research Laboratory, DSTO, Melbourne, Australia"],"lastName":"Sietsma","id":"37087689647"},{"name":"Dow","affiliation":["Materials Research Laboratory, DSTO, Melbourne, Australia"],"lastName":"Dow","id":"37087690528"}],"articleNumber":"23864","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":156,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":518},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=23864","abstract":"A continuing question in neural net research is the size of network needed to solve a particular problem. If training is started with too small a network for the problem no learning can occur. The researcher must then go through a slow process of deciding that no learning is taking place, increasing the size of the network and training again. If a network that is larger than required is used, then processing is slowed, particularly on a conventional von Neumann computer. An approach to this problem is discussed that is based on learning with a net which is larger than the minimum size network required to solve the problem and then pruning the solution network. The result is a small, efficient network that performs as well or better than the original which does not give a complete answer to the question, since the size of the initial network is still largely based on guesswork but it gives a very useful partial answer and sheds some light on the workings of a neural network in the process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1988.23864","startPage":"325","endPage":"333 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 1988 International Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/763/907/00023864.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE 1988 International Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1988.23864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=907","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural net pruning-why and how","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial intelligence","Learning systems","Neural networks","Problem-solving"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","learning systems","neural nets","problem solving"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","machine learning","problem solving","neural net","training"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/23864/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 July 1988","displayDocTitle":"Neural net pruning-why and how","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-27 July 1988","accessionNumber":"3327867","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural net pruning-why and how","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00023864.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034064S","chronDate":"24-27 July 1988","isNumber":"907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"763","citationCount":"156","articleId":"23864","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":23866,"authors":[{"name":"Werbos","affiliation":["College Park, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Werbos","id":"37344537300"}],"articleNumber":"23866","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":145,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":545},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial intelligence","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","artificial intelligence","backpropagation","AI","network architectures"]}],"abstract":"Some scientists have concluded that backpropagation is a specialized method for pattern classification, of little relevance to broader problems, to parallel computing, or to our understanding of the human brain.

In fact, the position of word stress is the basis for the automatic generation of the pattern of duration of the syllables and of the intonation of the whole phrase.

The number of hidden units must be sufficient to provide the discriminating capability required by the given application. On the other hand, the training of an excessively large number of synaptic weights may be computationally costly and unreliable. This makes it desirable to have an a priori estimate of an optimal number of hidden neurons. Another closely related issue is the learning rate of the BP rule. In general, it is desirable to have fast learning, but not so fast that brings about instability of the iterative computation. An algebraic projection (AP) analysis method is proposed that provides an analytical solution to both of these problems. If the training patterns are completely irregular, then the predicted optimal number of hidden neurons is the same as that of the training patterns. In the case of regularity embedded patterns, the number of hidden neurons will depend on the type of regularity inherent. The optimal learning rate parameter is found to be inversely proportional to the number of hidden neurons.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1988.23868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=907","startPage":"363","endPage":"370 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 1988 International Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/763/907/00023868.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An algebraic projection analysis for optimal hidden units size and learning rates in back-propagation learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/23868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 July 1988","displayDocTitle":"An algebraic projection analysis for optimal hidden units size and learning rates in back-propagation learning","conferenceDate":"24-27 July 1988","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3327870","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An algebraic projection analysis for optimal hidden units size and learning rates in back-propagation learning","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00023868.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022435S","chronDate":"24-27 July 1988","isNumber":"907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"763","citationCount":"88","articleId":"23868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":23870,"authors":[{"name":"Kollias","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National and Technical University of Athens, Greece"],"lastName":"Kollias","id":"37087393303"},{"name":"Anastassiou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Anastassiou","id":"37087206454"}],"articleNumber":"23870","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":40},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive systems","Artificial intelligence","Least squares methods","Neural networks","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive systems","artificial intelligence","least squares approximations","neural nets","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","adaptive training","multilayer neural networks","least squares estimation","Marquardt-Levenberg optimization","convergence rate factor","neuron","error function","backpropagation","computational complexity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=23870","abstract":"A technique is developed for the training of artificial neural networks, using a modification of the Marquardt-Levenberg optimization technique.

It is shown that convergence speedup is a function of the reuse rate, and that the reuse rate can be controlled by using a dynamic convergence parameter.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1988.23877","startPage":"441","endPage":"447 vol.1","publicationTitle":"IEEE 1988 International Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1988.23877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=907","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 1988 International Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/763/907/00023877.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving the learning rate of back-propagation with the gradient reuse algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/23877/","displayDocTitle":"Improving the learning rate of back-propagation with the gradient reuse algorithm","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3327879","publicationDate":"1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-27 July 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 July 1988","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving the learning rate of back-propagation with the gradient reuse algorithm","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00023877.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061693S","chronDate":"24-27 July 1988","isNumber":"907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"763","citationCount":"43","articleId":"23877","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":23885,"authors":[{"name":"Klassen","affiliation":["Center of Automation and Intelligent Systems Research, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"lastName":"Klassen","id":"37087875196"},{"name":"Pao","affiliation":["Center of Automation and Intelligent Systems Research, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"lastName":"Pao","id":"37087650266"},{"name":"Chen","affiliation":["Center of Automation and Intelligent Systems Research, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"lastName":"Chen","id":"37089050132"}],"articleNumber":"23885","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=23885","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial intelligence","Neural networks","Transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","neural nets","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning rate","artificial intelligence","neural nets","functional link net","delta rule net","input vector","tensors"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1988.23885","pdfPath":"/iel5/763/907/00023885.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE 1988 International Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 1988 International Conference on Neural Networks","startPage":"507","endPage":"513 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=907","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1988.23885","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characteristics of the functional link net: a higher order delta rule net","abstract":"Reports on the characteristics of a net which incorporates higher-order effects in supervised learning in ways different from those previously proposed.

This technique yields decision surfaces which approach the Bayes optimal under certain conditions. There is a continuous control of the linearity of the decision boundaries, from linear for small training sets to any degree of nonlinearity justified by larger training sets. A four-layer neural network of the type proposed can map any input pattern to any number of classifications. The input variables can be either continuous or binary. Modification of the decision boundaries based on new data can be accomplished in real time simply by defining a set of weights equal to the new training vector. The decision boundaries can be implemented using analog 'neurons', which operate entirely in parallel. The organization proposed takes into account the projected pin limitations of neural-net chips of the near future. By a change in architecture, these same components could be used as associative memories, to compute nonlinear multivariate regression surfaces, or to compute a posteriori probabilities of an event.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1988.23887","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 1988 International Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/763/907/00023887.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=907","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1988.23887","publicationTitle":"IEEE 1988 International Conference on Neural Networks","startPage":"525","endPage":"532 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic neural networks for classification, mapping, or associative memory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=23887","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 July 1988","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic neural networks for classification, mapping, or associative memory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/23887/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3327888","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-27 July 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic neural networks for classification, mapping, or associative memory","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00023887.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022689S","chronDate":"24-27 July 1988","isNumber":"907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"763","citationCount":"331","articleId":"23887","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":23890,"authors":[{"name":"Daugman","affiliation":["Division of Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Daugman","id":"37087462390"}],"articleNumber":"23890","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":59},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=23890","abstract":"Several image-processing problems require finding representations for 2-D signals in terms of expansion functions which, in general, may be either orthogonal nor complete.

The template and the image were transformed into the magnitude of the Fourier transform with log radial and angle axis, the mod F(ln r, theta ) mod position, scale, and rotation invariant (PSRI) feature space.

Each output is assumed to be a differentiable monotone transformation (typically the logistic) of a linear combination of inputs. Several examples are given of two families of vectors for which a linear combination exists that will serve to separate the two families. However, the minimum cost solution does not yield the desired combination. The examples include several cases where there are no local minima, as well as a one-layer system showing local minima with a large basin of attraction. In contrast to the perceptron convergence theorem, which proves that the perceptron architecture, there is no convergence theorem for gradient descent which would allow correct classification.

Usually, the measurement primitives used for computing optical flow from successive image frames are the image-intensity values and their spatial and temporal derivatives, and tokens such as edges, corners, and linear features. Conventional methods based on such primitives suffer from edge sparsity, noise distortion, or sensitivity to rotation. The authors first fit a 2-D polynomial to find a smooth continuous image-intensity function in a window and estimate the subpixel intensity values and their principal curvatures. Under the local rigidity assumption and smoothness constraints, a neural network is then used to implement the computing procedure based on the estimated intensity values and their principal curvatures. Owing to the dense measured primitives, a dense optical flow with subpixel accuracy is obtained with only a few iterations. Since intensity values and their principle curvatures are rotation-invariant, this method can detect both rotating and translating objects in the scene. Experimental results using synthetic image sequences demonstrate the efficacy of the method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1988.23914","startPage":"71","endPage":"78 vol.2","publicationTitle":"IEEE 1988 International Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1988.23914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=907","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 1988 International Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/763/907/00023914.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computation of optical flow using a neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/23914/","displayDocTitle":"Computation of optical flow using a neural network","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3350078","publicationDate":"1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-27 July 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 July 1988","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computation of optical flow using a neural network","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00023914.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065911S","chronDate":"24-27 July 1988","isNumber":"907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"763","citationCount":"68","articleId":"23914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":23922,"authors":[{"name":"Pomerleau","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Pomerleau","id":"37087963294"},{"name":"Gusciora","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Gusciora","id":"37087961732"},{"name":"Touretzky","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Touretzky","id":"37087961784"},{"name":"Kung","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Kung","id":"37087765707"}],"articleNumber":"23922","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":105,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":152},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=23922","abstract":"A fast back-propagation algorithm for a linear array of processors is described.

A simple refinement is presented that has sped up and eliminated the decaying dynamics compounded by the feeble and indecisive analog neurons having a self-decaying interconnect. In summary, the modified TSP version is based on binary neuronic output, analog neuronic input, a zero diagonal interconnect matrix, the necessary and sufficient constraint of a permutation matrix, Lagrangian multipliers a=b=c=1, and Euler's first-order integration with the step constant about 10/sup -4/. Programs, one written in True Basic running on a microcomputer (Macintosh Plus or Mac II) and the other written in C on a mainframe computer, are briefly mentioned.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1988.23937","startPage":"259","endPage":"266 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 1988 International Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/763/907/00023937.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE 1988 International Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1988.23937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=907","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast TSP algorithm based on binary neuron output and analog neuron input using the zero-diagonal interconnect matrix and necessary and sufficient constraints of the permutation matrix","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit fabrication","Matrices","Neural networks","Operations research","Optimization methods","Very-large-scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit technology","matrix algebra","neural nets","operations research","optimisation","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["operations research","optimisation","fast algorithm","binary neuron output","analog neuron input","zero-diagonal interconnect matrix","permutation matrix","scaled-up VLSI implementation","traveling salesman problem","decaying dynamics","indecisive analog neurons","self-decaying interconnect","Lagrangian multipliers","Euler's first-order integration","True Basic","microcomputer","Macintosh Plus","Mac II","C","mainframe computer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/23937/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 July 1988","displayDocTitle":"Fast TSP algorithm based on binary neuron output and analog neuron input using the zero-diagonal interconnect matrix and necessary and sufficient constraints of the permutation matrix","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-27 July 1988","accessionNumber":"3350101","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast TSP algorithm based on binary neuron output and analog neuron input using the zero-diagonal interconnect matrix and necessary and sufficient constraints of the permutation matrix","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00023937.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027895S","chronDate":"24-27 July 1988","isNumber":"907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"763","citationCount":"50","articleId":"23937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":23939,"authors":[{"name":"Foo Yoon-Pin Simon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA"],"lastName":"Foo Yoon-Pin Simon","id":"37087462212"},{"name":"Takefuji","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA"],"lastName":"Takefuji","id":"37087462422"}],"articleNumber":"23939","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":272},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Neural networks","Optimization methods","Scheduling","Stochastic systems","Trees (graphs)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer architecture","neural nets","optimisation","scheduling","stochastic systems","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic neural networks","positive current biases","constant current biases","near-optimal solutions","job-shop scheduling","NP-complete optimization problem","constraint satisfaction","neural computation architecture","Hopfield neural-network model","two-dimensional matrix representation","traveling salesman problem","negative current biases","excitations","inhibitions","operation precedence relationships","cost function trees","interdependency","cost","root node","simulated annealing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=23939","abstract":"An application of neural networks is presented for solving job-shop scheduling, and NP-complete optimization problem with constraint satisfaction.

Hopfield (1985) and others for finding the optimal tour in a traveling salesman problem using a neural network. This function contains four terms: one which reflects the length of the tour and three more penalty terms which attempt to maintain a feasible solution. These terms are combined into a weighted sum using four coefficients determined by the user. The quality of the final solution is very sensitive to these weighting factors, and good values for them are difficult to find when even a moderate number of cities are considered. A novel objective function is developed here that requires one weighting factor the value of which is easily determined. The use of this function in combination with an algorithm combining characteristics of neural networks and simulated annealing allows good, valid solutions to be found.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1988.23942","startPage":"299","endPage":"303 vol.2","publicationTitle":"IEEE 1988 International Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1988.23942","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=907","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 1988 International Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/763/907/00023942.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A traveling salesman objective function that works","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/23942/","displayDocTitle":"A traveling salesman objective function that works","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3350106","publicationDate":"1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-27 July 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 July 1988","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A traveling salesman objective function that works","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00023942.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027272S","chronDate":"24-27 July 1988","isNumber":"907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"763","citationCount":"59","articleId":"23942","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":23944,"authors":[{"name":"Ramanujam","affiliation":["Dept. of Comput. & Inf.

Tank's (1985) original formulation. In addition, two fixed-parameter networks are described, one for the TSP and the other for the LMP. The performance of the network for the TSP is comparable to the performance of the modified energy functional formulation, while the network for the list-matching problem is shown to perform better than a simple heuristic method. A major feature of these two networks is that the problem-dependent cost data are contained entirely in the linear term of the energy functional-the quadratic part contains only constraint information. This feature has the advantage that all costs can be presented to the network as inputs rather than as connection weights, much reducing hardware complexity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1988.23945","startPage":"333","endPage":"340 vol.2","publicationTitle":"IEEE 1988 International Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1988.23945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=907","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 1988 International Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/763/907/00023945.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Alternative networks for solving the traveling salesman problem and the list-matching problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/23945/","displayDocTitle":"Alternative networks for solving the traveling salesman problem and the list-matching problem","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3350109","publicationDate":"1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-27 July 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 July 1988","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Alternative networks for solving the traveling salesman problem and the list-matching problem","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00023945.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043618S","chronDate":"24-27 July 1988","isNumber":"907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"763","citationCount":"67","articleId":"23945","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":23946,"authors":[{"name":"Foo Yoon-Pin Simon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA"],"lastName":"Foo Yoon-Pin Simon","id":"38164036600"},{"name":"Takefuji","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA"],"lastName":"Takefuji","id":"37355165300"}],"articleNumber":"23946","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":894},"abstract":"The authors present an integer linear programming neural network (ILPNN) based on a modified Tank and Hopfield neural network model to solve job-shop scheduling, an NP-complete constraint satisfaction problem. The constraints of the job-shop problem are formulated as a set of integer linear equations. The cost function for minimization is the total starting times of all jobs subject to precedence constraints. In the authors' approach, the set of integer linear equations is solved by an iterative linear programming with integer adjustments (ILPIA) technique, without a branch-and-bound search. In particular, the linear and nonlinear zero-one variables are represented by linear sigmoid and nonlinear high-gain amplifiers with a response of a step function, respectively. Simulations based on solving a linear differential equation show that the ILPNN approach produces optimal or near-optimal solutions, although it does not guarantee optimal solutions.

It was found that when the MNNLS system and the underwriter disagree, the system's classifications are more consistent with the guidelines than the underwriter's judgement.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1988.23960","pdfPath":"/iel5/763/907/00023960.pdf","startPage":"459","endPage":"466 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 1988 International Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE 1988 International Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1988.23960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=907","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An application of a multiple neural network learning system to emulation of mortgage underwriting judgements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/23960/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 July 1988","displayDocTitle":"An application of a multiple neural network learning system to emulation of mortgage underwriting judgements","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3350124","publicationDate":"1988","conferenceDate":"24-27 July 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An application of a multiple neural network learning system to emulation of mortgage underwriting judgements","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00023960.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070307S","chronDate":"24-27 July 1988","isNumber":"907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"763","citationCount":"50","articleId":"23960","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":23962,"authors":[{"name":"Castelaz","affiliation":["Ground Systems Group, Neural Network Technology Center, Hughes Aircraft Company, Fullerton, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Castelaz","id":"37088004565"}],"articleNumber":"23962","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":97},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=23962","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pattern recognition","Learning systems","Military computing","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised pattern recognition","computerised signal processing","learning systems","military computing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trainable networks","neural networks","defense applications","sensor signal processing","optimization processing","network topologies","target signatures","learning networks","pattern recognition","topology","sensor signal complexity","back-propagation networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1988.23962","pdfPath":"/iel5/763/907/00023962.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE 1988 International Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 1988 International Conference on Neural Networks","startPage":"473","endPage":"480 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=907","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1988.23962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks in defense applications","abstract":"The author presents early results of preliminary experimental investigations of the performance of various trainable (back-propagation) networks applied to sensor signal processing and optimization processing problems. Various network topologies and target signatures were exercised. Networks ranged from two-layer to six-layer, with varying number of neurons per layer. Multiple training and test sets were synthesized and used in evaluating both the training characteristics and processing performance of the various networks. Preliminary results for learning networks in pattern recognition applications indicate very promising performance characteristics for fairly simple back-propagation networks, on the order of less than 50 neurons, as a function of topology, learning rate, and sensor signal complexity. Overall, the networks behaved as expected for back-propagation networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 July 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/23962/","accessionNumber":"3350126","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-27 July 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks in defense applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks in defense applications","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00023962.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045525S","chronDate":"24-27 July 1988","isNumber":"907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"763","citationCount":"6","articleId":"23962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":23972,"authors":[{"name":"Gardner","affiliation":["Department of Physiology and Biophysics, New York University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Gardner","id":"37087461952"}],"articleNumber":"23972","dbTime":"29 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pattern recognition","Detectors","Neural networks","Parallel processing","Robots","Tactile sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised pattern recognition","electric sensing devices","neural nets","parallel processing","robots","surface topography measurement","tactile sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern recognition","feature detection","biological neural network","somatosensory system","haptic information","tactile sensors","surface features","central nervous system","parallel processing mechanisms","primate hand","intelligent controllers","robotic hands"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=23972","abstract":"Biological neural networks in the somatosensory system process haptic information from the hand when it grasps and manipulates objects.

These token data are translated, normalized and constitute the input alphabet to a finite-state machine (automaton). The processed token events are used as partial belief in a set of anthropomimetic rules, which encode human knowledge about the occurrence of a particular sleep stage. The Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence weighs the partial beliefs and attributes the minute sleep stage to the machine state transition that displays the highest final belief.

The importance of the technique lies in its ability to supplement (and even partially replace) more expensive fully static dependency analysis.

The algorithms examined have their origins in the field of mathematical economics. They are shown to have several attractive properties, including their simplicity and distributed nature, the computation of feasible and increasingly better resource allocations as the result of each iteration, and, in the case of file allocation, rapid convergence. Conditions are formally derived under which the algorithms are guaranteed to coverage, and their convergence behavior is additionally examined through simulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/24272/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1989","publicationDate":"May 1989","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3420799","volume":"38","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A microeconomic approach to optimal resource allocation in distributed computer systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A microeconomic approach to optimal resource allocation in distributed computer systems","sourcePdf":"00024272.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040977S","chronDate":"May 1989","isNumber":"918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"148","articleId":"24272","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":24274,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The system can bear multiple faults in processing elements and/or links and still function with an acceptable performance degradation.

At any given time of a computation, faulty processing elements and/or links are circumvented by using such spare links. It is shown that the total silicon area required by this structure is only a constant factor higher than that of a complete binary tree.

MOSFETs with n/sup +/-polysilicon gates were fabricated down to channel widths of 0.5 mu m by using a novel planarization process with an etch stop. The threshold behavior is characterized as a function of both the sidewall-implanted boron and the three dimensional process/device simulations. The trench-isolated n-MOSFET shows the narrow-width effect with excess boron doses implanted in the sidewalls. It is found that the lateral diffusion of sidewall-implanted boron induces enhancement of the edge current although the devices show narrow-width effects. The trench-isolated p-MOSFETs show narrow-width effects with the buried-channel mode and the inverse-narrow width effect when surface channel conditions dominate at threshold. It is found that the narrow-width effect of p-MOSFETs strongly depends on the threshold adjustment by means of counter doping.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.24355","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","startPage":"1110","endPage":"1116","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/921/00024355.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.24355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Narrow-width effects of shallow trench-isolated CMOS with n/sup +/-polysilicon gate","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MOSFET circuits","Boron","Planarization","Resists","Etching","Silicon","Fuses","Implants","Counting circuits","Doping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit technology","ion implantation","semiconductor device models","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["n-MOSFETs","VLSI","models","ion implantation","3D device simulation","3D process simulation","trench-isolated CMOS","shallow trench isolation","n/sup +/-polysilicon gates","channel widths","planarization process","etch stop","threshold behavior","lateral diffusion","narrow-width effects","buried-channel mode","inverse-narrow width effect","surface channel conditions","p-MOSFETs","counter doping","0.5 micron","polycrystalline Si gates","Si:B"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1989","displayDocTitle":"Narrow-width effects of shallow trench-isolated CMOS with n/sup +/-polysilicon gate","volume":"36","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3432754","publicationDate":"June 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/24355/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Narrow-width effects of shallow trench-isolated CMOS with n/sup +/-polysilicon gate","sourcePdf":"00024355.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059217S","chronDate":"Jun 1989","isNumber":"921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"50","articleId":"24355","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":24363,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

It is assumed that impenetrable barriers limit the current flow to a film of thickness D. Because the electric field of injected electrons spreads out of the film, the level of injection is substantially higher than in the bulk case described by the classical Mott-Gurney law. As a consequence, the current density in a thin diode can be an order of magnitude larger than in a bulk diode of the same length. It is shown that, in the limit of small D, the total current is independent of D because the decreasing film thickness is exactly compensated by increasing injection. In this limit analytic expressions of the current-voltage characteristics are obtained for several model electrode configurations. The analytic results are confirmed by a numerical simulation of the diode within a drift-diffusion model assuming a field-independent mobility. The numerical results also describe a transition with decreasing D from the Mott-Gurney law to the new law governing space-charge-limited current in a film.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.24363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.24363","endPage":"1170","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/921/00024363.pdf","startPage":"1162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-charge-limited current in a film","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/24363/","displayDocTitle":"Space-charge-limited current in a film","volume":"36","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"3432762","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1989","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-charge-limited current in a film","sourcePdf":"00024363.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051429S","chronDate":"Jun 1989","isNumber":"921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"99","articleId":"24363","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":24364,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Distance is the average minimum path length over all pairwise combinations of nodes between two subsets of nodes. Distance can be successfully used to assess the conceptual distance between sets of concepts when used on a semantic net of hierarchical relations. When other kinds of relationships, like 'cause', are used, distance must be amended but then can again be effective. The judgements of distance significantly correlate with the distance judgements that people make and help to determine whether one semantic net is better or worse than another. The authors focus on the mathematical characteristics of distance that presents novel cases and interpretations. Experiments in which distance is applied to pairs of concepts and to sets of concepts in a hierarchical knowledge base show the power of hierarchical relations in representing information about the conceptual distance between concepts.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.24528","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/924/00024528.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.24528","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=924","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","startPage":"17","endPage":"30","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Development and application of a metric on semantic nets","volume":"19","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3444501","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/24528/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development and application of a metric on semantic nets","sourcePdf":"00024528.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037775S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1989","isNumber":"924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"974","articleId":"24528","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":24529,"authors":[{"name":"W.R.

NPN logics and relations are extensions of two-valued crisp logic, crisp (binary) relations, and fuzzy relations, NPN logics and relations assume logic values in the NPN interval (-1, 1) instead of values in (0, 1). A theorem is presented that provides conditions for the existence and uniqueness of heuristic transitive closures of an NPN relation. It is shown that NPN logic and NPN relations can be used directly to model a target world with a combination of NPN relationships of attributes and/or concepts for the purposes of cognitive map understanding, and decision analysis. Two algorithms are presented for heuristic transitive closure computation and for heuristic path searching, respectively. Basic ideas are illustrated by example.

A fuzzy association is introduced as a fuzzy relation defined on a set of indices to a database. One approach is the extension of fuzzy indices to a database using fuzzy associations. A fuzzy association is a generalization of the concept of fuzzy thesauri. An algorithm for fuzzy information retrieval based on this approach is developed. The other approach represents the retrieval process as a block diagram. Maximum and minimum operations are used instead of the ordinary sum and product operations on the diagram. Studies of advanced indexing, such as the clustering of articles, are represented as feedback on the diagram. Properties of fuzzy information retrieval, such as level fuzzy sets and set operations on responses of the retrieval system, are discussed using the diagram representation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=24541","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Information retrieval","Thesauri","Fuzzy sets","Feedback","Mathematical model","Clustering algorithms","Indexing","Fuzzy systems","Citation analysis","Information analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["database theory","fuzzy set theory","indexing","information retrieval","thesauri"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["database indices","maximum operations","article clustering","information retrieval","fuzzy associations","fuzzy relation","fuzzy thesauri","block diagram","minimum operations","advanced indexing"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/924/00024541.pdf","startPage":"123","endPage":"130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.24541","doi":"10.1109/21.24541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two approaches for information retrieval through fuzzy associations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/24541/","displayDocTitle":"Two approaches for information retrieval through fuzzy associations","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1989","accessionNumber":"3444511","volume":"19","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two approaches for information retrieval through fuzzy associations","sourcePdf":"00024541.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045236S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1989","isNumber":"924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"16","articleId":"24541","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":24550,"authors":[{"name":"K.B.

Subsequently, the system availability is computed by analyzing a simple network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/24588/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"38","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3420776","displayDocTitle":"Approximate availability analysis of VAXcluster systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate availability analysis of VAXcluster systems","sourcePdf":"00024588.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022707S","chronDate":"Apr 1989","isNumber":"926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"47","articleId":"24588","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":24592,"authors":[{"name":"K.A.S.

Two concatenated coding schemes are proposed. In one the inner code is decoded with soft-decision Viterbi decoding, and the outer RS code performs error-correction-only decoding (decoding without side information). In the other the inner code is decoded with a modified Viterbi algorithm, which produces reliability information along with the decoded output. In this algorithm, path metrics are used to estimate the entire information sequence, whereas branch metrics are used to provide reliability information on the decoded sequence. This information is used to erase unreliable bits in the decoded output. An errors-and-erasures RS decoder is then used for the outer code. The two schemes have been proposed for high-speed data communication on NASA satellite channels. The rates considered are at least double those used in current NASA systems, and the results indicate that high system reliability can still be achieved.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.24593","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.24593","startPage":"420","endPage":"427","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/927/00024593.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High rate concatenated coding systems using bandwidth efficient trellis inner codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/24593/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1989","displayDocTitle":"High rate concatenated coding systems using bandwidth efficient trellis inner codes","volume":"37","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3433292","publicationDate":"May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High rate concatenated coding systems using bandwidth efficient trellis inner codes","sourcePdf":"00024593.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066817S","chronDate":"May  1989","isNumber":"927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"40","articleId":"24593","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":24594,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It uses two date shaping pulses and two carriers, which are pairwise quadrature in phase, to create a four-dimensional signal space and increases the transmission rate by a factor of two over QPSK and MSK. However, the bit error rate performance depends on the choice of pulse pair. With simple sinusoidal and cosinusoidal data pulses, the E/sub b//N/sub 0/ requirement for P/sub b/(E)=10/sup -5/ is approximately 1.6 dB higher than that of MSK. Without additional constraints, Q/sup 2/PSK does not maintain a constant envelope, however, a simple block coding can provide a constant envelope. This coded signal substantially outperforms MSK and TFM (time-frequency multiplexing) in bandwidth efficiency. Like MSK, Q/sup 2/PSK also has self-clocking and self-synchronizing ability. An optimum class of pulse shapes for use in Q/sup 2/PSK format is presented. One suboptimum realization achieves the Nyquist rate of 2 b/s/Hz using binary detection.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.24595","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/927/00024595.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.24595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=927","startPage":"437","endPage":"448","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quadrature-quadrature phase-shift keying","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=24595","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Quadrature-quadrature phase-shift keying","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/24595/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1989","accessionNumber":"3433294","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quadrature-quadrature phase-shift keying","sourcePdf":"00024595.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051065S","chronDate":"May 1989","isNumber":"927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"106","articleId":"24595","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":24596,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Two problems which may arise due to the presence of noise in the flow field are examined. First, motion parameters of the sensor or a rigidly moving object may be extremely difficult to estimate because there may exist a large set of significantly incorrect solutions which induce flow fields similar to the correct one. The second problem is in the decomposition of the environment into independently moving objects. Two such objects may induce optical flows which are compatible with the same motion parameters, and hence, there is no way to refute the hypothesis that these flows are generated by one rigid object. These ambiguities are inherent in the sense that they are algorithm-independent. Using a mathematical analysis, situations where these problems are likely to arise are characterized. A few examples demonstrate the conclusions. Constraints and parameters which can be recovered even in ambiguous situations are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/24780/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1989","volume":"11","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1989","accessionNumber":"3421349","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Inherent ambiguities in recovering 3-D motion and structure from a noisy flow field","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inherent ambiguities in recovering 3-D motion and structure from a noisy flow field","sourcePdf":"00024780.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042805S","chronDate":"May 1989","isNumber":"937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"166","articleId":"24780","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":24781,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Therefore, dense optical flow is often ill-suited for computing structure from motion and for reconstructing the 3-D velocity field by algorithms which require a locally accurate estimate of the motion field. A different use of the optical flow is suggested. It is shown that the (smoothed) optical flow and the motion field can be interpreted as vector fields tangent to flows of planar dynamical systems. Stable qualitative properties of the motion field, which give useful informations about the 3-D velocity field and the 3-D structure of the scene, usually can be obtained from the optical flow. The idea is supported by results from the theory of structural stability of dynamical systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.24781","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/937/00024781.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.24781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=937","startPage":"490","endPage":"498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion field and optical flow: qualitative properties","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=24781","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Motion field and optical flow: qualitative properties","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/24781/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1989","accessionNumber":"3421350","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion field and optical flow: qualitative properties","sourcePdf":"00024781.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057358S","chronDate":"May 1989","isNumber":"937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"220","articleId":"24781","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":24782,"authors":[{"name":"P.

An approach is proposed that relies on modeling principles and likely hypothesis testing techniques. A spatiotemporal edge in an image sequence is modeled as a surface patch in a 3-D spatiotemporal space. A likelihood ratio test enables its detection as well as simultaneous estimation of its related attributes. It is shown that the computation of this test leads to convolving the image sequence with a set of predetermined masks. The emphasis is on a restricted but widely relevant and useful case of surface patch, namely the planar one. In addition, an implementation of the procedure whose computation cost is merely equivalent to a spatial gradient operator is presented. This method can be of interest for motion-analysis schemes, not only for supplying spatiotemporal segmentation, but also for extracting local motion information. Moreover, it can cope with occlusion contours and important displacement magnitude.

The unification requires a set-theoretic methodology, where signals are modeled as sets, systems (signal transformations) are viewed as set mappings, and translational-invariant systems are uniquely characterized by special collections of input signals. This approach leads to a general representation theory, in which any translation-invariant, increasing, upper semicontinuous system can be presented exactly as a minimal nonlinear superposition of morphological erosions or dilations. The theory is used to analyze some special cases of image/signal analysis systems, such as morphological filters, median and order-statistic filters, linear filters, and shape recognition transforms. Although the developed theory is algebraic, its prototype operations are well suited for shape analysis; hence, the results also apply to systems that extract information about the geometrical structure of signals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.24793","startPage":"586","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/938/00024793.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.24793","endPage":"599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=938","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A representation theory for morphological image and signal processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/24793/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1989","displayDocTitle":"A representation theory for morphological image and signal processing","volume":"11","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3433497","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A representation theory for morphological image and signal processing","sourcePdf":"00024793.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045032S","chronDate":"Jun 1989","isNumber":"938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"155","articleId":"24793","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":24809,"authors":[{"name":"C.W.

Reinforcement and temporal-difference learning methods are presented that deal with these issues to avoid unstable conditions and balance the pendulum.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/37.24809","startPage":"31","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/37/939/00024809.pdf","endPage":"37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=939","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/37.24809","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/24809/","displayDocTitle":"Learning to control an inverted pendulum using neural networks","volume":"9","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3417827","publicationDate":"April 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to control an inverted pendulum using neural networks","sourcePdf":"00024809.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041898S","chronDate":"April  1989","isNumber":"939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"37","citationCount":"376","articleId":"24809","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":24810,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Mandelbrot's fractal theory (1982), it was found that the fractal dimension could be obtained in medical images by the concept of fractional Brownian motion. An estimation concept for determination of the fractal dimension based upon the concept of fractional Brownian motion is discussed. Two applications are found: (1) classification; (2) edge enhancement and detection. For the purpose of classification, a normalized fractional Brownian motion feature vector is defined from this estimation concept. It represented the normalized average absolute intensity difference of pixel pairs on a surface of different scales. The feature vector uses relatively few data items to represent the statistical characteristics of the medial image surface and is invariant to linear intensity transformation. For edge enhancement and detection application, a transformed image is obtained by calculating the fractal dimension of each pixel over the whole medical image. The fractal dimension value of each pixel is obtained by calculating the fractal dimension of 7*7 pixel block centered on this pixel.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/24861/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"8","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3431075","pubMedId":"18230510","displayDocTitle":"Fractal feature analysis and classification in medical imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fractal feature analysis and classification in medical imaging","sourcePdf":"00024861.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033923S","chronDate":"June  1989","isNumber":"942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"287","articleId":"24861","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":24867,"authors":[{"name":"J.

From the premise that the result of a reconstruction should be feasible, the shape and characteristics of the region of feasibility in projection space are examined.

This program solves the Poisson and continuity equations in silicon under DC, transient, and small-signal conditions. Executing on a vector/parallel minisupercomputer, SIERRA utilizes a matrix solver which uses an incomplete LU (ILU) preconditioned conjugate gradient square (CGS, BCG) method. The ILU-CGS method provides a good compromise between memory size and convergence rate. The authors have observed a 5* to 7* speedup over standard direct methods in simulations of transient problems containing highly coupled Poisson and continuity equations such as those found in reliability-oriented simulations. The application of SIERRA to parasitic CMOS latchup and DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) single-event-upset studies is described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.24880","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","startPage":"516","endPage":"527","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/943/00024880.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.24880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=943","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SIERRA: a 3-D device simulator for reliability modeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit simulation","Integrated circuit modeling","Semiconductor device reliability","Poisson equations","Semiconductor devices","Instruments","Semiconductor device modeling","Silicon","Convergence","Single event upset"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","digital simulation","electronic engineering computing","random-access storage","reliability","semiconductor device models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IC device modelling","Poisson equations","DC conditions","transient conditions","DRAM SEV studies","SIERRA","3-D device simulator","reliability modeling","general-purpose semiconductor-device simulation program","reliability issues","continuity equations","small-signal conditions","vector/parallel minisupercomputer","matrix solver","incomplete LU","preconditioned conjugate gradient square","ILU-CGS method","memory size","convergence rate","speedup","transient problems","coupled Poisson and continuity equations","reliability-oriented simulations","parasitic CMOS latchup"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1989","displayDocTitle":"SIERRA: a 3-D device simulator for reliability modeling","volume":"8","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3442037","publicationDate":"May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/24880/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SIERRA: a 3-D device simulator for reliability modeling","sourcePdf":"00024880.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044966S","chronDate":"May 1989","isNumber":"943","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"28","articleId":"24880","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":24885,"authors":[{"name":"N.K.

A design procedure for a buck ZVS QRC is proposed that minimizes voltage stress to the power MOSFET transistor while maintaining zero voltage switching for specified ranges of input voltage and load resistance. A quasi-resonant gate drive scheme is also proposed and implemented in a buck converter. The drive is simple and provides high switching speed. Power dissipation in the gate drive is substantially reduced due to the quasi-resonant operation. The ZVS QRC technique described is suitable for very-high-frequency operation due to its ability to reduce dynamic turn-on losses, Miller effect, dv/dt, and di//dt and can be applied in distributed onboard power supplies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/63.24904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.24904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=945","startPage":"194","endPage":"204","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/945/00024904.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=24904","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Zero voltage switching","Resonance","Capacitance","Switches","Switching converters","Switching loss","MOSFET circuits","Capacitors","DC-DC power converters","Switching circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["losses","power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zero-voltage switched quasi-resonant convertors","buck convertors","flyback converters","ZVS QRC","voltage stress","power MOSFET transistor","zero voltage switching","dynamic turn-on losses","Miller effect","distributed onboard power supplies","5 to 10 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Zero-voltage-switched quasi-resonant buck and flyback converters-experimental results at 10 MHz","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1989","accessionNumber":"3435225","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/24904/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero-voltage-switched quasi-resonant buck and flyback converters-experimental results at 10 MHz","sourcePdf":"00024904.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030345S","chronDate":"April  1989","isNumber":"945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"96","articleId":"24904","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":24908,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

Due to the voltage constraint imposed at the motor terminals, the power capability will fall to zero for most motor designs at a given high speed.

The first technique is a feedforward compensation algorithm that improves the performance of current regulators operating in the stationary reference frame. Speed-dependent back-EMF (electromotive force) and inductive voltage drops are compensated, so that steady-state current errors are nulled at all speeds until current regulator saturation limits are encountered. The second technique is a flux-weakening control algorithm which uses stator current components to prevent premature current regulator saturation, thereby improving the machine's torque production capabilities at high speeds. Neither algorithms requires additional feedback signals from the motor beyond those already used in the preexisting controls, and they are relatively insensitive to variations in the machine parameters, despite their feedforward characteristics.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1988.25074","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1988 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1988 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/726/952/00025074.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1988.25074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=952","startPage":"272","endPage":"280 vol.1","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00025074.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control techniques for improved high-speed performance of interior PM synchronous motor drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=25074","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Control techniques for improved high-speed performance of interior PM synchronous motor drives","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-7 Oct. 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/25074/","conferenceDate":"2-7 Oct. 1988","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3389598","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control techniques for improved high-speed performance of interior PM synchronous motor drives","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00025074.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072817S","chronDate":"2-7 Oct. 1988","isNumber":"952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"726","citationCount":"10","articleId":"25074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":25075,"authors":[{"name":"W.D.

This estimated signal is then used as the velocity feedback signal for the velocity loop control. An analysis is presented of the limitations of such approaches, and a technique which optimally estimates the velocity at each sample instant is presented. The method is shown to offer a significant improvement in command-driven systems and to reduce the effect of quantized angular resolution which limits the ultimate performance of all digital servo drives. The noise reduction is especially relevant for AC servo drives due to the high current loop bandwidths required for their correct operation. The method demonstrates improved measurement performance over a classical DC tachometer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00025087.png","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1988 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/726/952/00025087.pdf","startPage":"363","endPage":"368 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1988 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1988.25087","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1988.25087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=952","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=25087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High resolution velocity estimation for all digital, AC servo drives","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servomechanisms","Signal resolution","Optical feedback","Optical signal processing","Transducers","Velocity measurement","Feedback loop","Velocity control","Noise reduction","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric drives","servomechanisms","velocity measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC servo drives","velocity measurement","velocity feedback signal","velocity loop control","command-driven systems","quantized angular resolution","digital servo drives","noise reduction","high current loop bandwidths"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/25087/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-7 Oct. 1988","displayDocTitle":"High resolution velocity estimation for all digital, AC servo drives","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3389606","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-7 Oct. 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High resolution velocity estimation for all digital, AC servo drives","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00025087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027632S","chronDate":"2-7 Oct. 1988","isNumber":"952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"726","citationCount":"28","articleId":"25087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":25092,"authors":[{"name":"T.G.

The controller uses no additional state feedback and results in better performance than the current-regulated delta modulator (CR Delta M). This novel discrete-time regulator, which switches between adjacent switching vectors and the zero state based on the CR Delta M state, contains most of the operating characteristics of the optimum regulator. Simulation results of the proposed regulator are compared to the CR Delta M and the optimum discrete time current regulator. The same ideas used in the discrete pulse case can be extended to form a hard-switched hysteresis-type current regulator. In either case, the regulator is easily implemented, requiring no calculation of counter-EMF (electromotive force) or Delta I. In addition, a modified sigma-delta modulated voltage regulator is derived which satisfies the pulse polarity consistency rule. Finally, complete experimental results are given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel5/726/952/00025092.pdf","startPage":"395","endPage":"405 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1988 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00025092.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=952","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1988.25092","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1988.25092","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1988 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=25092","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse modulation","Regulators","State feedback","Delta modulation","Switches","Hysteresis","Delta-sigma modulation","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["controllers","electric current control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete pulse modulated current regulator","load current","controller","hard-switched hysteresis-type current regulator","sigma-delta modulated voltage regulator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-7 Oct. 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/25092/","displayDocTitle":"Performance characterization of a new discrete pulse modulated current regulator","accessionNumber":"3389611","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1988","conferenceDate":"2-7 Oct. 1988","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance characterization of a new discrete pulse modulated current regulator","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00025092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036189S","chronDate":"2-7 Oct. 1988","isNumber":"952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"726","citationCount":"56","articleId":"25092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":25094,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The method is based on a feedforward approach which produces compensating signals obtained from those of the I/sub d/-I/sub q/ current and primary angular frequency references in a rotating reference (d-q) frame. The method features excellent inverter output voltage distortion correction for both fundamental and harmonic components. The correction is not affected by the magnitude of the inverter output voltage or current distortions. Since this dead-time compensation method allows current loop calculations in the d-q frame at a slower sampling rate with a conventional microprocessor than calculations in a stationary reference frame, a fully digital, vector-controlled speed regulator with just a current component loop is realized for PWM (pulsewidth modulation) VSIs. Test results obtained for the compression method are described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00025101.png","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1988 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/726/952/00025101.pdf","startPage":"463","endPage":"469 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1988 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1988.25101","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1988.25101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=952","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=25101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fully digital, vector-controlled PWM VSI-fed AC drives with an inverter dead-time compensation strategy","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation","Voltage","Pulse width modulation inverters","Frequency","Harmonic distortion","Sampling methods","Microprocessors","Regulators","Space vector pulse width modulation","Digital modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","electric drives","invertors","pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fundamental components","vector-controlled PWM","AC drives","dead-time compensation method","voltage-source inverters","feedforward approach","inverter output voltage distortion correction","harmonic components","digital","vector-controlled speed regulator","current component loop","pulsewidth modulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/25101/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-7 Oct. 1988","displayDocTitle":"Fully digital, vector-controlled PWM VSI-fed AC drives with an inverter dead-time compensation strategy","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3389617","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-7 Oct. 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fully digital, vector-controlled PWM VSI-fed AC drives with an inverter dead-time compensation strategy","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00025101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031851S","chronDate":"2-7 Oct. 1988","isNumber":"952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"726","citationCount":"26","articleId":"25101","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":25106,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The scheme provides instantaneous current response in the AC motor by altering the modulation index of the current-source PWM patterns. To achieve this task, optimum programmed PWM patterns with selective elimination of lower-order harmonics in the motor line currents are used. Output filter capacitors are provided to bypass the current harmonics in the inverter output and allow for the instantaneous changes in line currents. This method of control provides sinusoidal output voltages and sinusoidal currents in the AC motor. The scheme guarantees fast response characteristics combined with high-performance steady-state behavior. A design procedure for the current-source PWM and selection of programmed PWM current patterns for a variable-speed situation are illustrated.

Cell passages and driving electrodes can be fabricated in arbitrary two-dimensional shape, allowing great flexibility in its design. Through an analytical study it was found that a careful tailoring of a field pattern is essential in realizing cell motions. Methods for detailed field analysis are developed and used to design cell-handling components. One is the FIC cell shift register, a device in which cells are stored and electrostatically transported one-by-one, just as bits are shifted in TTL shift registers. The other is the FIC cell deflector, where the cell fed from the inlet can be dielectrophoretically deflected to either of the bifurcating branches.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1988.25294","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1988 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1988 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/726/952/00025294.pdf","startPage":"1735","endPage":"1740 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1988.25294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Handling of biological cells using fluid integrated circuit","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=25294","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-7 Oct. 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/25294/","displayDocTitle":"Handling of biological cells using fluid integrated circuit","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3380226","conferenceDate":"2-7 Oct. 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Handling of biological cells using fluid integrated circuit","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00025294.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044301S","chronDate":"2-7 Oct. 1988","isNumber":"952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"726","citationCount":"10","articleId":"25294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":25309,"authors":[{"name":"R.R.

Two different N/sub it/ formation mechanisms are observed. Most (typically 90%) of the formation, called the late process, occurs slowly at long times (1-10000 s) after the radiation pulse. From a variety of experimental data, it is concluded that the rate of the late process is limited by drift of a radiation-induced positive ion, probably H/sup +/, through the gate oxide to the Si-SiO/sub 2/ interface where the N/sub it/ are formed. A relatively fast, or early, process is responsible for a small percentage of the total N/sub it/ formation.

Using three different sets of samples ranging from hard to soft, it is possible to observe a considerable reversal of the oxide trapped charge component in the two harder sets and essentially none in the soft set. These results are interpreted in terms of electrons tunneling back and forth from the Si substrate to electron traps associated with the simple oxygen vacancy (an E' center) in the oxide. Some of these compensating electrons do reform the Si-Si bonds broken by the trapped holes. The results are consistent with a large body of previous work.

During annealing the bias is 1 MV/cm. Annealing times range from under an hour to hundreds of hours, and the temperature ranges from 75 to 175 degrees C. Using charge pumping, the energy distribution of interface states within the bandgap is determined. After annealing, the shape of the interface-state density curve implies that one or more defects other than P/sub b0/ and P/sub b1/ are present. Comparison of the interface-state density curves before and after annealing shows that a redistribution of interface-state density occurs over a large portion of the time-temperature range studied. The density near 0.4 eV above the valence band decreases and the density near 0.7 eV increases although the average density does not significantly change. Based upon the time scale and activation energy of the redistribution, a model is proposed in which the rate-limiting step is water diffusion within the gate oxide to the interface. This model provides a framework for a transformation among interface defects that accounts for the observed redistribution. Further tests for this model are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=964","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/964/00025438.pdf","doi":"10.1109/23.25438","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.25438","startPage":"1192","endPage":"1196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Annealing of total dose damage: redistribution of interface state density on [100], [110] and [111] orientation silicon","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/25438/","displayDocTitle":"Annealing of total dose damage: redistribution of interface state density on [100], [110] and [111] orientation silicon","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"3354593","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Annealing of total dose damage: redistribution of interface state density on [100], [110] and [111] orientation silicon","sourcePdf":"00025438.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038434S","chronDate":"Dec 1988","isNumber":"964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"39","articleId":"25438","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":25439,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The results are consistent with a damage mechanism involving migration of vacancies to form well-separated stable defects.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.25441","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/964/00025441.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.25441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=964","startPage":"1208","endPage":"1214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High energy electron induced displacement damage in silicon","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=25441","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High energy electron induced displacement damage in silicon","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/25441/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1988","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1988","accessionNumber":"3354596","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High energy electron induced displacement damage in silicon","sourcePdf":"00025441.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063746S","chronDate":"Dec 1988","isNumber":"964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"83","articleId":"25441","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":25443,"authors":[{"name":"G.P.

High-energy recoils are mainly produced by inelastic nuclear interactions between the incident protons and the target atoms. A review of previous calculations indicates that both the fast cascade and the evaporation phases of the elastic interaction contribute to the average energy of the recoiling ion. New calculations are presented for the energy dependence of the nonionizing energy deposited in GaAs as a result of inelastic interaction with protons over the energy range 10-1000 MeV. These calculations are combined with the previously determined contribution from elastic interactions to obtain the energy dependence of the total nonionizing energy deposited in GaAs by protons. The calculation is compared with both new and earlier experimental data for ion-implanted GaAs resistors irradiated with protons over the energy range 40-188 MeV, in order to form a basis whereby proton displacement effects in GaAs structures can be predicted. It is shown that results obtained for 10 MeV protons, for example, can be used to predict results to be expected at much higher energies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.25443","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/964/00025443.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.25443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=964","startPage":"1221","endPage":"1226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Displacement damage in GaAs structures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=25443","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Displacement damage in GaAs structures","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/25443/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1988","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1988","accessionNumber":"3354598","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Displacement damage in GaAs structures","sourcePdf":"00025443.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040501S","chronDate":"Dec 1988","isNumber":"964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"90","articleId":"25443","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":25445,"authors":[{"name":"N.S.

Two distinct N/sub it/ formation processes are observed. A small (1-10% of total) process occurs at 100-150 K, which is caused by neutral atomic hydrogen, and a second, higher-temperature (200-300 K) process that accounts for most ( >90%) of the N/sub it/ formation also occurs. The characteristics of the high-temperature process support the proton (H/sup +/) model of N/sub it/ formation and are not in agreement with several other common models. Charge pumping and inversion layer mobility techniques for determining N/sub it/ are compared. It is found that the mobility cannot be used to determine N/sub it/ at 78 K (in contrast to its successful use at 295 K), probably because of lateral uniformities in the large radiation-induced fixed oxide charge.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.25445","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/964/00025445.pdf","startPage":"1234","endPage":"1240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.25445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Formation of interface traps in MOSFETs during annealing following low temperature irradiation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/25445/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1988","displayDocTitle":"Formation of interface traps in MOSFETs during annealing following low temperature irradiation","volume":"35","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1988","accessionNumber":"3354600","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Formation of interface traps in MOSFETs during annealing following low temperature irradiation","sourcePdf":"00025445.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090373S","chronDate":"Dec 1988","isNumber":"964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"85","articleId":"25445","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":25449,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

The measured device response is compared to the predicted response. In comparisons of 10-keV X-ray and Co-60 irradiations of Al-gate MOS capacitors at an oxide electric field of 1 MV/cm, predictions and experiments agree to within better than 20% for oxide thicknesses ranging from 35 to 1060 nm. For capacitors with TaSi/Al gates, they agree to within better than 30% at 1 MV/cm, with the largest differences occurring for 35-nm gate oxides. At other electric fields, the disagreement between experiment and prediction increases significantly for both Al- and TaSi/Al-gate capacitors. For medium-energy ( approximately 100-keV average photon energy) X-irradiations, the enhanced device response exhibits a much stronger dependence on endpoint bremsstrahlung energy than expected from TIGERP or CEPXS/ONETRAN simulations.

The agreement between theory and experiment is excellent.

An analysis of the sensitivity of the circuits to single-event upset, (SEU) was made, and a hardness limitation coming from an ion-induced transient caused by substrate-related phenomena was found. Dose, dose rate, and SEU behavior are related to the structural characteristics mentioned above.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From substrate to VLSI: investigation of hardened SIMOX without epitaxy, for dose, dose rate and SEU phenomena","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.25464","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/964/00025464.pdf","startPage":"1355","endPage":"1360","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00025464.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.25464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=964","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=25464","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/25464/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1988","displayDocTitle":"From substrate to VLSI: investigation of hardened SIMOX without epitaxy, for dose, dose rate and SEU phenomena","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1988","accessionNumber":"3354616","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From substrate to VLSI: investigation of hardened SIMOX without epitaxy, for dose, dose rate and SEU phenomena","sourcePdf":"00025464.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054126S","chronDate":"Dec 1988","isNumber":"964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"60","articleId":"25464","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":25465,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

For top-gate and sidewall insulators, Co-60 and 10-keV X-ray irradiations at matched dose rates lead to nearly identical responses. Back-gate response, on the other hand, depends strongly on radiation energy and buried insulator thickness. Different X-ray to Co-60 correlation factors can be observed for other technologies with different sidewall and buried insulator materials and thicknesses. It is demonstrated that it is not possible to define a generic set of worst-case radiation bias conditions for all SOI technologies, as back-gate radiation response can be a strong function of transistor drain bias during exposure. However, the magnitude of this effect can vary with material and device processing, and the detailed changes in Si island potential and insulator electric fields that cause this behavior are not yet understood.

Two phenomena that are known to play a significant role in determining the magnitude of the collected charge generated by an ion beam-funneling and the shunt effect-were also observed for irradiation by a pulsed laser beam. The results show that the collected charge from laser irradiation was proportional to the 4/3 power of the laser energy for the case of funneling and to the 1.683 power of the laser energy for the shunt effect, in full agreement with results previously obtained for ion-beam irradiation. The proportionality constant for these CMOS devices was smaller by a factor of 6.5 for the laser-induced shunt experiments due to the much lower track charge density produced by the laser light. By correcting the laser data to take the lower charge density in the track into account, a good correlation between the ion and laser data was found, suggesting that the pulsed laser can be used to measure SEU sensitivity of integrated circuits.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/25490/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1988","volume":"35","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1988","accessionNumber":"3354640","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Charge collection from focussed picosecond laser pulses","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Charge collection from focussed picosecond laser pulses","sourcePdf":"00025490.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044502S","chronDate":"Dec 1988","isNumber":"964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"54","articleId":"25490","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":25491,"authors":[{"name":"E.

By accounting for the production of the ionizing particles by the PuBe and RTG neutron spectra, convenient upper-bound single-event-upset rates for memory devices near an RTG can be derived.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.25491","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/964/00025491.pdf","startPage":"1523","endPage":"1528","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.25491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of PuBe source to simulate neutron-induced single event upsets in static RAMs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=25491","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/25491/","displayDocTitle":"Use of PuBe source to simulate neutron-induced single event upsets in static RAMs","volume":"35","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1988","accessionNumber":"3354641","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of PuBe source to simulate neutron-induced single event upsets in static RAMs","sourcePdf":"00025491.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059074S","chronDate":"Dec 1988","isNumber":"964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"14","articleId":"25491","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":25499,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The tests were conducted with both protons and heavy ions, yielding correlated comparisons of results. Most of the single-event vulnerability data were obtained using EDI EDH8832C, IDT IDT71256, OMNI-WAVE OW62256, and RCA XCDM62256 32 K*8 static RAMs. Among the four device types only OW62256s were resistant to single-event latchup. Estimates of the single-event-upset (SEU) rate in space show that OW62256s are the least susceptible devices. The test and reduction methods took into consideration multiple upsets caused by a single ion, the effect of read/write access time, and scaling related to feature size. The scaling study was made possible by comparing the SEU test results of an additional four types of radiation-hardened IDT static RAMs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.25512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.25512","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/964/00025512.pdf","startPage":"1638","endPage":"1643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=964","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/25512/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1988","displayDocTitle":"SEU test techniques for 256 K static RAMs and comparisons of upsets by heavy ions and protons","volume":"35","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3354658","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1988","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SEU test techniques for 256 K static RAMs and comparisons of upsets by heavy ions and protons","sourcePdf":"00025512.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049464S","chronDate":"Dec 1988","isNumber":"964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"53","articleId":"25512","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":25513,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

The qualitative charge transport has been simulated using a 2-D numerical code in cylindrical coordinates. The experimental bit-map data clearly show the manifestation of lateral charge transport in the creation of adjacent multiple-bit errors from a single heavy-ion track. The heavy-ion data further demonstrate the occurrence of multiple-bit errors from single ion tracks with sufficient stopping power. The qualitative numerical simulation results suggest that electric-field-funnel-aided (drift) collection accounts for single error generated by an ion passing through a charge-collecting junction, while multiple errors from a single ion track are due to lateral diffusion of ion-generated charge. A quantitative analysis of this effect would require that the simulation be extended to adjacent devices and would therefore require a 3-D numerical code in Cartesian coordinates.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lateral charge transport from heavy-ion tracks in integrated circuit chips","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.25513","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/964/00025513.pdf","startPage":"1644","endPage":"1647","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.25513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=964","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=25513","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/25513/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1988","displayDocTitle":"Lateral charge transport from heavy-ion tracks in integrated circuit chips","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1988","accessionNumber":"3354659","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lateral charge transport from heavy-ion tracks in integrated circuit chips","sourcePdf":"00025513.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029077S","chronDate":"Dec 1988","isNumber":"964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"38","articleId":"25513","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":25517,"authors":[{"name":"T.C.

It was found that a worst-case anneal temperature for rebound testing is highly process-dependent. At an anneal temperature of 80 degrees C, the timing parameters of a 16 K SRAM from vendor A quickly saturate at maximum values and display no further changes at this temperature. At higher temperatures, evidence for the anneal of the interface-state charge is observed. Dynamic bias during irradiation results in the same saturation value for the timing parameters, but the anneal time required to reach this value is no longer. CMOS/SOS integrated circuits (vendor B) showed similar behavior, except that the saturation value for the timing parameters was stable up to 105 degrees C. After irradiation to 10 Mrad(Si), a 16 K SRAM (vendor C) was annealed at 80 degrees C, and the access time decreased toward prerad values during the anneal.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","Random access memory","Annealing","Interface states","Circuit testing","Ionizing radiation","Timing","MOS devices","Temperature dependence","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["annealing","CMOS integrated circuits","integrated memory circuits","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","postirradiation response","temperature","irradiation bias","worst-case anneal temperature","rebound testing","timing parameters","SRAM","interface-state charge","saturation value","access time","80 degC","16 kbit","105 degC","10E6 rad"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=25517","doi":"10.1109/23.25517","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/964/00025517.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.25517","startPage":"1662","endPage":"1666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=964","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Post-irradiation effects in CMOS integrated circuits (SRAMs)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Post-irradiation effects in CMOS integrated circuits (SRAMs)","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/25517/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1988","volume":"35","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1988","accessionNumber":"3354663","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Post-irradiation effects in CMOS integrated circuits (SRAMs)","sourcePdf":"00025517.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07118S","chronDate":"Dec 1988","isNumber":"964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"7","articleId":"25517","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":25518,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

Improving the torque response of a large-capacity induction motor using two sets of three-phase inverters and an open-data induction motor is of special concern. Instantaneous voltage vectors applied by an inverter have redundancy characteristics which provide some flexibility for selecting the inverter switching modes. By using this switching freedom, control is achieved according to the following priorities: (1) high-speed torque control; (2) regulation of the primary flux; (3) decreasing the zero phase sequence current; and (4) minimization of the inverter switching frequency. Simulations and experiments have been carried out to verify the feasibility of this priority control, accompanied by comparisons with another control scheme. Torque frequency-response corner frequencies above 2000 Hz have been experimentally measured, and time constants of 4 ms have been achieved for rotor-speed step responses from -500 to 500 r/min. The peak transient torque during the step change is about 20 times the rate torque.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/28.25540","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","startPage":"257","endPage":"264","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/966/00025540.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.25540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=966","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-performance direct torque control of an induction motor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque control","Induction motors","Inverters","Switching frequency","Servomechanisms","Automatic control","DC motors","Control systems","Motor drives","AC motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motors","invertors","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3-phase invertors","direct torque control","induction motor","switching modes","primary flux","zero phase sequence current","2000 Hz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 1989","displayDocTitle":"High-performance direct torque control of an induction motor","volume":"25","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3444559","publicationDate":"March-April 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/25540/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-performance direct torque control of an induction motor","sourcePdf":"00025540.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022057S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 1989","isNumber":"966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"396","articleId":"25540","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":25541,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The authors develop a phase variable model of the BDCM (brushless DC motor) and use it to examine the performance of a BDCM speed servo drive system when fed by hysteresis and pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) current controllers. Particular attention was paid to the motor large-signal and small-signal dynamics and motor torque pulsations. The simulation included the state-space model of the motor and speed controller and real-time model of the inverter switches. Every instance of a power device turning on or off was simulated to calculate the current oscillations and resulting torque pulsations. The results indicate that the small- and large-signal responses are very similar. This result is only true when the timing of the input phase currents with the back EMF (electromotive force) is correct. The large-signal and small-signal speed response is the same whether PWM or hysteresis current controllers are used. This is because, even though the torque pulsations may be different due to the use of different current controllers, the average value which determines the overall speed response is the same.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling, simulation, and analysis of permanent-magnet motor drives.

Six load-commutation schemes are combined into a single commutation scheme, referred to as a generalized load-commutation circuit, and the steady-state analysis for the circuit with RL load is presented using a Fourier series approach in the continuous-current mode. The equations for different load-commutation circuits are obtained as the particular cases of the generalized configuration. This type of unified approach simplifies the method of analysis for different commutation schemes and eliminates the need for the separate analysis of different schemes. Also, in a computer program, the results for a particular configuration can be obtained simply by opening or shorting the nonrequired commutating components of the generalized scheme. The method of analysis is used to select resonant inverter schemes with resistive load, based on certain constraints. Experimental results are presented for the selected schemes to support the theory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Steady-state","Resonant inverters","Circuits","Resonance","Hafnium","Fourier series","Differential equations","Industry Applications Society","Power conversion","Genetic mutations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["commutation","invertors","resonance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier series analysis","resonant inverters","generalized load-commutation circuit","steady-state analysis"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=966","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.25549","startPage":"326","endPage":"338","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/966/00025549.pdf","doi":"10.1109/28.25549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A generalized approach for the steady-state analysis of resonant inverters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 1989","displayDocTitle":"A generalized approach for the steady-state analysis of resonant inverters","accessionNumber":"3433285","publicationDate":"March-April 1989","volume":"25","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/25549/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A generalized approach for the steady-state analysis of resonant inverters","sourcePdf":"00025549.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024271S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 1989","isNumber":"966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"63","articleId":"25549","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":25551,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Improvements to the current control abilities of the cycloconverter, applying modern control and information theories, are discussed. To obtain good current follow characteristics, both deadbeat control and prediction control are applied. The dead-beat scheme possesses one sample delay in its controlled signal which can compensate by predicting reference signals of the next sample time. To predict the load currents at the next sample time, two prediction methods are used. One of the predictions, which has learning ability for repetitive waves using correlation functions of the current, is composed of 256 digital filters. The weighting coefficients of the filters are determined instantaneously to minimize RMS (root mean square) errors. The other prediction, which has a high-frequency response, is applied to compensate random components and high-frequency components. The system is controlled by two digital signal processors for prediction of the currents, and a 16-bit microprocessor for control of the cycloconverter. Experimental results show excellent compensation abilities, not only for repetitive harmonics but also for high-frequency random components.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=966","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/966/00025551.pdf","doi":"10.1109/28.25551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.25551","startPage":"348","endPage":"355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction control for a cycloconverter of a power distortion compensation system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/25551/","displayDocTitle":"Prediction control for a cycloconverter of a power distortion compensation system","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"3444563","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March-April 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction control for a cycloconverter of a power distortion compensation system","sourcePdf":"00025551.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074445S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 1989","isNumber":"966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"14","articleId":"25551","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":25552,"authors":[{"name":"L.T.

The authors present a global optimality condition of the problem and two algorithms: one is based on the uniformly distributed load model and the other on the concentrated current (or power) demand model. The derivation of the optimality condition relies on a concept of 'basic' current profiles of feeder sections and a transformation of the optimization problem. In the first algorithm, a closed form of the minimum-loss open point of a feeder pair can be found since the loss function is piecewise-parabolic. The algorithm obtains the optimal solution when the minimum is obtained for every feeder pair. In the second algorithm, a similar procedure is performed by moving open points, one at a time, from an actual switch position to another until no further loss reduction can be achieved. The proposed algorithm can be utilized as an online aid to distribution system operators.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Minimization methods","Switches","Load modeling","Load flow","Load flow analysis","Automation","Automatic control","Power system modeling","Control systems","Change detection algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","losses","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concentrated current demand model","distribution feeders","open switch positions","minimum-loss configuration","radial distribution system","discrete optimization","global optimality condition","distributed load model"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=967","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.25615","startPage":"1281","endPage":"1289","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/967/00025615.pdf","doi":"10.1109/61.25615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Loss minimization of distribution feeders: optimality and algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1989","displayDocTitle":"Loss minimization of distribution feeders: optimality and algorithms","accessionNumber":"3435179","publicationDate":"April 1989","volume":"4","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/25615/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Loss minimization of distribution feeders: optimality and algorithms","sourcePdf":"00025615.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036866S","chronDate":"Apr 1989","isNumber":"967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"110","articleId":"25615","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":25620,"authors":[{"name":"W.A.

The solution uses a search over different radial configurations created by considering switchings of the branch exchange type. To guide the search, two different power flow approximation methods with varying degrees of accuracy have been developed and tested. The methods are used to calculate the new power flow in the system after a branch exchange and they make use of the power flow equations developed for radial distribution systems. Both accuracy analysis and the test results show that estimation methods can be used in searches to reconfigure a given system even if the system is not well compensated and reconfiguring involves load transfer between different substations.

Sargent (1972) concluded that the median current of the lightning strokes collected by a structure increases when the height of the structure is increased. In the present work, it is shown that Sargent's conclusion is applicable only to the case of equal striking distances, and that Sargent's use of too low a median current to flat ground has inadvertently exaggerated the effect of height on median current. For the realistic case of unequal striking distances, the median current versus height relation is a U-curve which is relatively flat. It is found that the electrogeometric model is not incompatible with the median findings of R.B. Anderson and A.J. Eriksson (1980), and that the median amplitude of the strokes collected by power lines is practically constant over the typical height range.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/25632/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1989","accessionNumber":"3435193","volume":"4","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The implications of the electrogeometric model regarding effect of height of structure on the median amplitude of collected lightning strokes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The implications of the electrogeometric model regarding effect of height of structure on the median amplitude of collected lightning strokes","sourcePdf":"00025632.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034991S","chronDate":"Apr 1989","isNumber":"967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"57","articleId":"25632","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":25635,"authors":[{"name":"W.A.

Results are given of an experimental study on four spans of an idle 115 kV three-phase transmission line. Under conditions of 33 degrees C ambient, 2 to 4 km/hr effective wind speed, high solar input and 260 A load current, the 477 kcmil conductor temperature reached 47 degrees C. The ampacity models of H.E. House and D.D. Tuttle (1959) and IEEE (ANSI/IEEE Standard 783-1986) provided reliable predictions of conductor temperature when the site weather data were used. Conductor temperature estimates prepared using forecast data from a weather prediction system were less certain; the differences were caused by natural scatter in the data and by reduction factors in the wind model. It is found that wind angle should be increased somewhat to model improved cooling of the conductor when wind direction is fluctuating. The change of clearance with temperature was found to be significantly larger than anticipated in short spans, because of limitations in the application of the ruling-span approximation. The physical errors are small but the line-rating process is very sensitive to these errors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmission lines","Conductors","Temperature","Weather forecasting","Wind forecasting","Wind speed","ANSI standards","Scattering","Predictive models","Cooling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooling","overhead line conductors","power overhead lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3-phase power transmission lines","power overhead lines","conductor temperature estimates","weather prediction system","wind direction","49 degC","115 kV","260 A"]}],"doi":"10.1109/61.25635","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/967/00025635.pdf","startPage":"1476","endPage":"1485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=967","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.25635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ampacity studies on 49 degrees C-rated transmission line","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=25635","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ampacity studies on 49 degrees C-rated transmission line","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/25635/","volume":"4","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1989","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3435196","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ampacity studies on 49 degrees C-rated transmission line","sourcePdf":"00025635.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043273S","chronDate":"Apr 1989","isNumber":"967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"9","articleId":"25635","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":25637,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The proposed approach is characterized by convergence to the optimum or a near-optimum solution and the independence of the final solution from the initial status of the network switches. The methodology has been implemented in a production-grade computer program, DISTOP (Distribution Network Optimization). The compensation-based power flow technique developed at Pacific Gas and Electric Company for the efficient solution of weakly meshed distribution networks is an essential part of this loss reduction methodology. Important implementation aspects of the methodology and the results of its application to several realistic distribution networks are presented. Numerous test results have indicated that the proposed technique is computationally robust and efficient and, hence, suitable for both planning and operations studies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/967/00025637.pdf","startPage":"1492","endPage":"1498","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=967","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.25637","doi":"10.1109/61.25637","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=25637","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Optimization methods","Convergence","Protection","Power engineering computing","Iterative methods","Senior members","Systems engineering and theory","Robustness","Computational efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","load flow","losses","power system analysis computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","resistive line losses reduction","DISTOP","Distribution Network Optimization","compensation-based power flow technique","Pacific Gas and Electric Company"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/25637/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1989","displayDocTitle":"Reconfiguration of electric distribution networks for resistive line losses reduction","accessionNumber":"3446032","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1989","volume":"4","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfiguration of electric distribution networks for resistive line losses reduction","sourcePdf":"00025637.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03148S","chronDate":"Apr 1989","isNumber":"967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"616","articleId":"25637","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":25647,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

The entire fault population of the circuit is randomly divided into two groups. Only one group, usually the smaller one, is used for test generation by the test-generator and fault-simulator programs. This group is known as the sample and its coverage is deterministic. The coverage of faults in the remaining group is similar to that of random vectors and is estimated from the distribution of fault detection probabilities in the circuit. As the sample size increases, the fraction of unsampled faults reduces. At the same time, a larger sample yields more test vectors to increase the random coverage. For a circuit with high testability, a sample of just 5% faults, will provide tests for a 95% coverage. On the other hand, for a circuit with a relatively poor testability, one may have to sample 33% faults for the same coverage. For most practical cases, the sampling approach will mean significant saving in the computation and storage needs of fault simulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1988.25659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.1988.25659","startPage":"58","endPage":"61","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1988 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel2/214/969/00025659.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1988 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Test generation by fault sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct 1988","displayDocTitle":"Test generation by fault sampling","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 1988","publicationDate":"1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3317240","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/25659/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Test generation by fault sampling","confLoc":"Rye Brook, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00025659.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025584S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct 1988","isNumber":"969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"214","citationCount":"11","articleId":"25659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":25661,"authors":[{"name":"W.-T.

The propagation is modelled by coupled transmission lines which include losses. For conductors whose thickness is small compared to the skin depth over the principal spectrum of the pulse being propagated, the losses can be treated as frequency-independent; otherwise, the losses must be calculated as a function of frequency. It was observed that the inductance may be approximately treated as constant, but the resistance variations in frequency may be significant. A semi-analytical method for computing the transients in lossy lines serves as the basis for the simulation of nonuniform lines.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/25664/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct 1988","publicationDate":"1988","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3317245","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and simulation of coupled lossy lines for VLSI interconnections","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and simulation of coupled lossy lines for VLSI interconnections","confLoc":"Rye Brook, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00025664.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0638S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct 1988","isNumber":"969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"214","citationCount":"5","articleId":"25664","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":25666,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The compilation method is presented together with an assessment of the performance of compiled delay-insensitive circuits based on first-time-right silicon.

In this verification method, the specification of a digital system is defined as the input/output behavior of the external systems that communicate with the target system. The specification description called a cospecification and the implementation description called an FBL (functional block level) description are transformed into a hardware model representation and composed by connecting their related ports in the hardware model. Whether the design is correct or not is verified by producing state transitions of the composite system. This verification method requires only input/output relations between the cospecification description and the FBL description.

The main goal of the research was to investigate whether the efficiency of trellis-coded modulation (TCM) schemes and their saving in transmitted power could be maintained in a system environment dominated by interference more than by additive white Gaussian noise. A second goal was to compare the performance of signals with constant envelope, like 16-PSK, with that of signals allowing variations in amplitude, like 16-QAM. A method for performance evaluation leading to an estimate of the asymptotic power gain of the modulation systems is given.

The following features are discussed: unbundled service logic for functional flexibility, functional components as service primitives, service creation, INA signaling and addressing, and communicating over the SS7 network. It is concluded that with the INA new services can be introduced at centralized nodes. As service usage grows and is accepted by the market, service logic migrates toward the subscriber access point. As services are distributed out into the network, the centralized nodes become free and can be reused in a continuing process of successive introduction of new services. The pace of migration is determined by the network cost for centralization versus the operation and administrative costs for distribution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1988.25858","publicationTitle":"IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition.

This implementation requires a computational complexity per symbol which is linear in the number of users. An exact probability of error analysis shows that even the two-stage detector is particularly well suited for near-far situations.

It is shown that a (2, 3) decision-feedback equalizer using the CFKA meets the CEPT/GSM objectives over the whole specified range of echo delays and also at high vehicle speeds (up to about 300 km/h), whereas the Viterbi equalizer can cope with the channel distortions produced by echo delays less than about 14-15 mu m.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1988.25952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=971","publicationTitle":"IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition.

Different RS coders were used to code the SBC bits, depending on their perceptual significance and their position in the Gray-coded QAM words. Proposed schemes operating at 5.3 and 6.7 kbaud yielded near-toll-quality speech for channel signal/noise ratios in excess of 29 and 22 dB, and delays of 180 and 144 ms, respectively, for vehicular speeds of 30 and 60 mph.

The performance of these transceivers is compared with that of a conventional transceiver, with no preprocessor, on some loops within the CSA (carrier serving area) design rules. It is found that when self near-end crosstalk (NEXT) is the predominant impairment, using adaptive transmitters in addition to adaptive decision-feedback equalizers (DFEs) offers to advantage over using fixed transmitters with DFEs.

An arrangement of node functions in this network is proposed in which the call set-up process is excluded from transit nodes. This leads to a reduction in node processing and simplification of equipment by specialization of transit node functions. Virtual path control is shown to bring benefits in efficiency and flexibility. Among them a transmission efficiency improvement due to bandwidth control, a simple three-value bandwidth control algorithm improves the efficiency considerably with only a slight processing increase.

The system has 16 time-division time-duplex channels (slots) per carrier, each occupying 2 MHz. The TDMA frame is 16-ms long, and each slot has bits for synchronization, signaling and data. The data speed is suited for 32-kb/s speech codecs. Procedures have been developed for efficient and quick dynamic channel allocation and handover, using the fact that one single radio can simultaneously monitor or communicate on all 16 channels. Simulations for a specific six-storeyed building indicate that 16 channels can provide wireless communication for up to 30% of the telephones, and 32 channels for up to 100% of the telephones. Tests show that no time dispersion equalizers are needed, and that antenna diversity is effective against fading dips and time dispersion.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1988.26046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=971","startPage":"1343","endPage":"1349 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition.

A number of methods proposed in the literature are analyzed and their relative merits are pointed out. The various methods are contrasted using the phase error variance of the recovered carrier as a performance measure. The effect of timing errors is also shown for clock-aided schemes. The FMPL (Fujino Mth power loop), DDL (decision-directed loop) and VE (Viterbi estimator) are shown to exhibit better behavior than the Mth power loop in the narrowband case, provided that the clock recovery error is small and the signal-to-noise ratio is sufficiently high. Introduction of TCM (trellis code modulation) in the channel alphabet is also discussed. It has been found that it does not affect the performance of the DDL and VE methods, whereas it can have moderate effect on the other techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of carrier recovery methods for narrow-band polyphase shift keyed signals","publicationTitle":"IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition.

These, dual-beam cantilever devices incorporate silicon structures introduced at the wafer level for air damping and bidirectional overrange protection, resulting in a silicon/glass chip approximately 3.4 mm square and 1.5 mm thick, suitable for packaging in many configurations and for use in many applications. Critical damping and overdamping have been demonstrated with roll-off frequencies 500 Hz and above, and shock survival above 1000 G in all axes has been achieved. Cross-axis sensitivity is less than 2% for any axis. Device design was accomplished using finite-element modeling (FEM) to assess sensitivity, temperature coefficients, resonance modes, cross-axis sensitivity, and overrange characteristics. Analytical modeling was used to 'benchmark' the FEM predictions for simplest cases, and experimental results are in good agreement with FEM.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=976","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOLSEN.1988.26427","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00026427.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Technical Digest on Solid-State Sensor and Actuator Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Technical Digest on Solid-State Sensor and Actuator Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel2/783/976/00026427.pdf","startPage":"35","endPage":"38","doi":"10.1109/SOLSEN.1988.26427","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A monolithic silicon accelerometer with integral air damping and overrange protection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 June 1988","displayDocTitle":"A monolithic silicon accelerometer with integral air damping and overrange protection","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 June 1988","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3278342","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/26427/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A monolithic silicon accelerometer with integral air damping and overrange protection","confLoc":"Hilton Head, SC, USA","sourcePdf":"00026427.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049416S","chronDate":"6-9 June 1988","isNumber":"976","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"783","citationCount":"54","articleId":"26427","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":26452,"authors":[{"name":"S.

It is shown that the autocorrelation of an all-pole sequence, obtained by passing white noise through an all-pole filter 1/A(z), is an all-pole sequence of the form 1/A/sup 2/(z). A short-time modified coherence (SMC) representation is proposed that is an all-pole modeling of the autocorrelation sequence with a spectral shaper. The spectral shaper, essentially a square root operator in the frequency domain, compensates for the inherent spectral distortion introduced by the autocorrelation operation on the autocorrelation sequence of the signal. The properties of the SMC representation, especially its robustness to additive white noise, are analyzed. Initial implementation of the SMC in a speaker-dependent isolated word recognizer shows an improvement in recognition accuracy equivalent to an increase in input SNR of approximately 13 dB, as compared to the LPC recognizer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/28053/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"June 1989","accessionNumber":"3433414","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"37","issue":"6","displayDocTitle":"The short-time modified coherence representation and noisy speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The short-time modified coherence representation and noisy speech recognition","sourcePdf":"00028053.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047224S","chronDate":"Jun 1989","isNumber":"1155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"86","articleId":"28053","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":28056,"authors":[{"name":"M.D. Zoltowski","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"M.D.","lastName":"Zoltowski","id":"37278519000"},{"name":"D.

This redundancy is manifested by two fundamental properties of the noiseless X and Y data matrices comprising the ESPRIT data pencil: (a) they have the same row space, the signal subspace; and (2) they have the same column space, the source subspace. These properties are utilized by invoking two primary tools: (1) the solution to the procrustes problem for optimally approximating an invariant subspace rotation; and (2) the total-least-squares method for perturbing each of two estimates of a common subspace in a minimal fashion until the two perturbed spaces are the same.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/1155/00028056.pdf","startPage":"832","endPage":"861","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASSP.1989.28056","doi":"10.1109/ASSP.1989.28056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensor array signal processing via a procrustes rotations based eigenanalysis of the ESPRIT data pencil","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1989","displayDocTitle":"Sensor array signal processing via a procrustes rotations based eigenanalysis of the ESPRIT data pencil","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/28056/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1989","accessionNumber":"3433417","volume":"37","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensor array signal processing via a procrustes rotations based eigenanalysis of the ESPRIT data pencil","sourcePdf":"00028056.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054013S","chronDate":"Jun 1989","isNumber":"1155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"81","articleId":"28056","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":28057,"authors":[{"name":"H.-I.

They then show how the exponential kernel controls the cross terms as represented in the generalized ambiguity function domain, and they analyze the ED for two specific types of multicomponent signals: sinusoidal signals and chirp signals. Next, they define the ED for discrete-time signals and the running windowed exponential distribution (RWED), which is computationally efficient. Finally, the authors present numerical examples of the RWED using the synthetically generated signals.

Four realizations are derived with emphasis on real-time processing in a multiprocessor environment. This implies maximizing parallelism and pipelining, minimizing data throughput delay, and developing computational primitives which can be used as building blocks for very-large-scale integrated-circuit (VLSI) implementation. Advantage is taken of well-known realization structures for 1-D systems in developing the derivations. The performance of each realization is evaluated using criteria appropriate for real-time processing and multiprocessor implementation. It is shown that a simple computational primitive of one multiplier and one adder can be used to realize the filter with data throughput delay time equal to the time required for one multiplication and one addition, independent of the order of the filter. However, the number of required processors is different for each realization, and thus each realization has a different efficiency measure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ASSP.1989.28058","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/1155/00028058.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASSP.1989.28058","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","startPage":"872","endPage":"881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiprocessor implementation of 2-D denominator-separable digital filters for real-time processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=28058","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1989","displayDocTitle":"Multiprocessor implementation of 2-D denominator-separable digital filters for real-time processing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/28058/","volume":"37","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1989","accessionNumber":"3433419","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiprocessor implementation of 2-D denominator-separable digital filters for real-time processing","sourcePdf":"00028058.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047195S","chronDate":"Jun 1989","isNumber":"1155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"37","articleId":"28058","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":28059,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This transformation makes it possible to use unified Fourier reconstruction sampling principles to obtain accurate reconstruction based on a set of constraints imposed on the spiral parameters. The results are then utilized to develop efficient sampling strategies for the linear class of spirals, the spiral of Archimedes. Sampling efficiency for spiral data, analogous to the sampling efficiencies of hexagonally and rectangularly sampled data, is defined. A sampling scheme on a spiral is introduced that possesses a uniform sampling efficiency comparable to the sampling efficiency of rectangularly sampled data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Image sampling","Spirals","Image processing","Magnetic resonance imaging","Sampling methods","Fourier transforms","Frequency domain analysis","Tomography","Biomedical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","picture processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier mode imaging systems","sampling constraints","spiral data","image processing","circularly bandlimited two-dimensional function","general spiral contour","evenly spaced samples","nonlinear two-dimensional transformation","Cartesian coordinates","unified Fourier reconstruction sampling","spiral of Archimedes","uniform sampling efficiency"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ASSP.1989.28059","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/1155/00028059.pdf","startPage":"882","endPage":"891","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASSP.1989.28059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction and sampling constraints for spiral data (image processing)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=28059","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction and sampling constraints for spiral data (image processing)","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/28059/","volume":"37","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1989","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3433420","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction and sampling constraints for spiral data (image processing)","sourcePdf":"00028059.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035115S","chronDate":"Jun 1989","isNumber":"1155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"14","articleId":"28059","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":28060,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

The graphics in the segmented image is processed to represent thin entities by their core lines and thick objects by their boundaries. Lines of various types are identified and segmented into straight line and curved line segments during this process. The line segments and their interconnections are analyzed to locate minimum redundancy loops which are adequate to generate a succinct description of the graphics. Various hatching and filling patterns in the image are identified and described. The algorithm has been implemented as software, and its robustness and performance have evaluated tested using a number of test images.

The technique is also insensitive to slight deviation in shape and structure from a reference. The rotation-invariant features are the magnitudes of the Zernike moments of the image. Unlike classical moments, the Zernike moments are a mapping of the image onto a set of orthogonal basis functions, which gives them many useful properties. A novel synthesis-based approach for selection of these features is presented. Using this procedure, the discrimination power of features is evaluated by examining dissimilarities among images synthesized from them for different patterns.

Zahn and R.S. Roskies (1972) and G defined by G.H. Granlund (1972). In the first part of the paper ZR descriptors are studied. Two modifications of ZR descriptors are proposed. The new descriptors are based on step signature and smoother signature. The amplitudes of FDs are invariant under rotations, translations, changes in size, mirror reflections, and shifts in the starting point. In all the cases the reconstruction accuracy in terms of the number of FDs is studied, resulting in approximation error bounds. An efficient reconstruction method not requiring numerical integration is proposed for polygonal shapes. In the second part of the work theoretical results are verified in numerical experiments involving handwritten characters. In the same experiments, the performances of ZR and G descriptors are compared.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/28290/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Nov 1988","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14 May-17 Nov. 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3351282","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction of two dimensional patterns by Fourier descriptors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction of two dimensional patterns by Fourier descriptors","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"00028290.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035394S","chronDate":"14-17 Nov 1988","isNumber":"1164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"220","citationCount":"4","articleId":"28290","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":28307,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The images are derived from only one object, but the form is varied. The system is composed of two subsystems: a model acquisition part (the modeler) and an image processing strategy part (the strategist). On the assumption that the object consists of hinges, slides, and solids, the modeler learns their number in the object and the relationship among them. The strategist binds the functional features as hinges or slides with visual features in the actual image data. The image processing sequence for the extraction of the visual feature is not given but is learned automatically through trial and error.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.1988.28369","publicationTitle":"[1988 Proceedings] 9th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"[1988 Proceedings] 9th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel2/220/1164/00028369.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.1988.28369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1164","startPage":"818","endPage":"821 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIRACLE-IV: multiple image recognition system aiming concept learning-intelligent vision","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=28369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIRACLE-IV: multiple image recognition system aiming concept learning-intelligent vision","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Nov 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/28369/","conferenceDate":"14 May-17 Nov. 1988","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3351349","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIRACLE-IV: multiple image recognition system aiming concept learning-intelligent vision","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"00028369.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035277S","chronDate":"14-17 Nov 1988","isNumber":"1164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"220","citationCount":"5","articleId":"28369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":28457,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The DR laser, in principle, has the properties of high efficiency and high-power performance in dynamic-single-mode operation, thus eliminating the problems of low device efficiency in DFB (distributed-feedback) lasers and low output power in DBR (distributed Bragg reflector) lasers. The effective length of a DR including gain and loss, is introduced and is applied for the analytical determination of the lasing condition. The conditions required for dynamic-single-mode operation with one-facet output are given in terms of the propagation constant difference between the active and passive regions related to the coupling coefficient of the passive reflector. This condition is experimentally found to be attainable by utilizing a conventional fabrication process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/29254/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1989","volume":"25","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1989","accessionNumber":"3456652","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Single-mode properties of distributed-reflector lasers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-mode properties of distributed-reflector lasers","sourcePdf":"00029254.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051532S","chronDate":"Jun 1989","isNumber":"1246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"27","articleId":"29254","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":29257,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.A.

Arbitrary series combinations of uniform pitch grating, linearly-chirped pitch grating and plane guide sections can be analyzed-taking longitudinal-mode spatial hole burning into account. The material properties of each section of a device structure can be specified. The output power from each end of the laser and the emission wavelength, and the longitudinal intensity, carrier density, and relative permittivity profiles are predicted as a function of drive current above threshold for each lasing mode. The linewidth is also estimated while allowing for the nonuniform longitudinal distribution of spontaneous emission into the mode in a physical manner. The model was used to provide the data with which to trade off the numerous interacting performance parameters of a lambda /4 phase-shifted DFB (distributed-feedback) laser.

It takes into account the finite p-type contact resistivity, the two-dimensional current spreading, and the electron leakage current by drift and diffusion. Using this model, the influence of the relevant device parameters on the leakage current in InGaAsP/InP devices emitting at 1.3 mu m is investigated. It is shown that leakage currents are negligible at room temperature if the contact stripe width does not exceed the sum of the active region width and the p-type confinement layer thickness, but they increase markedly with broader contact stripes and with contact resistivities above 10/sup -5/ Omega -cm/sup 2/. The most important parameter influencing the leakage currents is the doping level of the P-InP confinement layer. With a p-type doping level of 1*10/sup 18/ cm/sup -3/, a p-type contact resistivity below 10/sup -5/ Omega -cm/sup 2/ and a contact stripe width of 6 mu m, the model calculations predict a maximum operation temperature exceeding 100 degrees C.

Sources are related to the transmembrane action potential through a bidomain model of heart muscle. Microscopic and macroscopic aspects of the bidomain model are developed. Various transformations of the source are considered, including multipoles, multiple dipoles, and replacement of the volume distribution with distributions on the heart surface.

DSM offers utility management many alternatives to improving customer satisfaction and maintaining good customer relations in the increasingly competitive area of electric supply, besides improving the utility's financial health.

Resonant frequency and resonant resistance are compared with calculated values from the representative theories. The measurements show that erratic results may be obtained for substrates thicker than about 0.02 lambda /sub 0/, where lambda /sub 0/ is the free-space wavelength at the resonant frequency. These problems may be related to coax-to-microstripline transitions, but their cause is not yet definitely known. The theoretical models that are compared give reasonably good results for resonant frequency, but none give impedance results that are consistently reliable. It thus appears that further work is needed to develop analytical models that can adequately predict the impedance performance of microstrip antennas on thick and/or high dielectric constant substrates.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.29353","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"677","endPage":"682","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/1251/00029353.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.29353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of microstrip antenna substrate thickness and permittivity: comparison of theories with experiment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microstrip antennas","Resonant frequency","Antenna measurements","Permittivity measurement","Electrical resistance measurement","Thickness measurement","Patch antennas","Feeds","Resonance","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric impedance","microstrip antennas","permittivity","substrates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resonant frequency","substrate thickness","permittivity","patch antennas","resonant resistance","free-space wavelength","coax-to-microstripline transitions","theoretical models","impedance performance","microstrip antennas","high dielectric constant substrates"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1989","displayDocTitle":"Effect of microstrip antenna substrate thickness and permittivity: comparison of theories with experiment","volume":"37","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3456371","publicationDate":"June 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/29353/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of microstrip antenna substrate thickness and permittivity: comparison of theories with experiment","sourcePdf":"00029353.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029821S","chronDate":"Jun 1989","isNumber":"1251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"162","articleId":"29353","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":29356,"authors":[{"name":"A.R.

An expression for the weight vector is first derived. Using the array gain on the desired signal and the coherent interference is obtained. Then the expression for output signal-to-noise (SNR) is derived. It shows that the performance of the spatially smoothing array depends on the number of the subarrays, the angle separation, relative power and initial phase difference between the desired signal and the coherent interference. For good interference suppression it is found that the magnitude of the phase difference of the incident and interference signals must be greater than the beamwidths of both the subarray and the equivalent array. There is also a tradeoff between increasing the groups of subarrays and decreasing the number of elements in the subarrays.

The degrees of freedom are shown to be practically equal to the Nyquist number appropriate to the effective (spatial) bandwidth of the scattered field and to the extension of the observation domain. Accordingly, a finite number of elements of information can be used to determine the scattered field to a prescribed approximation error. It is also shown that the field representation can be made in terms of field values and simple sampling functions, provided that a marginal increase in the approximation error is tolerated. The results not only completely justify the use of sampling interpolation for representing scattering fields, but also demonstrate that such representation is practically an optimal one.

In large-sale systems, the concept of vector Lyapunov functions has been used with the possibility of choosing quadratic forms, norm-like functions, and their combinations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/9.29394","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/1253/00029394.pdf","startPage":"674","endPage":"688","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.29394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1253","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameter space methods for robust control design: a guided tour","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/29394/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1989","displayDocTitle":"Parameter space methods for robust control design: a guided tour","volume":"34","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3465925","publicationDate":"July 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter space methods for robust control design: a guided tour","sourcePdf":"00029394.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.329682S","chronDate":"Jul 1989","isNumber":"1253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"224","articleId":"29394","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":29398,"authors":[{"name":"P.P.

A single station (communication node) is considered, and it is assumed that each customer (message) must begin service (transmission) by an individually varying extinction time or else it is lost. Interest is in minimizing, in the sense of stochastic order, the number of messages lost over any time interval. A variety of results is proved that establishes the optimality of the shortest-time-to-extinction policy under rather general conditions. Similar results are found when messages have constraints on their complete transmission times. A network of M stations in tandem is considered under the hypothesis that a message is never lost and is scheduled irrespective of whether its extinction time (also called due date in this case) has expired or not. Under fairly general assumptions on the arrivals, deadlines, and services, it is shown that the earliest-due-date policy minimizes a form of average tardiness incurred over a finite operating horizon among all non-idling nonpreemptive policies. These problems are formulated in the context of stochastic dominance, and simple interchange arguments are used to establish all results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/1253/00029398.pdf","startPage":"721","endPage":"728","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/9.29398","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.29398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1253","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=29398","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal scheduling with strict deadlines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimal scheduling","Stochastic processes","Dynamic scheduling","Time factors","Context","Cost function","Terminology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","dynamic scheduling","messages","time-critical environments","communication node","customer","service","transmission","extinction time","stochastic order","shortest-time-to-extinction policy","earliest-due-date policy","non-idling nonpreemptive policies","stochastic dominance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/29398/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1989","displayDocTitle":"Optimal scheduling with strict deadlines","volume":"34","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1989","accessionNumber":"3465929","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal scheduling with strict deadlines","sourcePdf":"00029398.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029906S","chronDate":"Jul 1989","isNumber":"1253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"70","articleId":"29398","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":29399,"authors":[{"name":"M.G.

Three communication graphs (spanning trees) for the Boolean n-cube are proposed for the routing, and scheduling disciplines provably optimum within a small constant factor are proposed. With appropriate scheduling and concurrent communication on all ports of every processor, routings based on these two communication graphs offer a speedup of up to n/2, and O( square root n) over the routings based on the spanning binomial tree for cases (2)-(4) respectively.

This goal is achieved by the polymorphic principle, which injects switches with circuit-switching capability into every node of a base network (e.g. a two-dimensional torus). The polymorphic approach maintains wiring complexity of the base network but effectively increases the communication bandwidth due to its flexibility in reconfiguring the switches individually and dynamically to match the algorithm graph. Formal analysis on interpackage wiring (the flux) and the intrapackage wiring (the fluid) is given for the polymorphic-torus and the related torus networks. Three algorithms, namely, the Boolean, the max/min, and the sum operations, are developed to illustrate the use of the polymorphic principle in enhancing the communication bandwidth with no penalty of the interpackage wiring complexity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00029479.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/1256/00029479.pdf","startPage":"1345","endPage":"1351","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/12.29479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.29479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1256","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=29479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polymorphic-torus network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Counting circuits","Adders","Research and development","Delay","Logic arrays","Clocks","Registers","Bit rate","Input variables","Pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessor interconnection networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polymorphic-torus network","interconnection network","parallel fine-grained","SIMD","communication bandwidth","circuit-switching capability","wiring complexity","interpackage wiring","Boolean","max/min","sum operations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/29479/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1989","displayDocTitle":"Polymorphic-torus network","volume":"38","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","accessionNumber":"3488975","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polymorphic-torus network","sourcePdf":"00029479.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074477S","chronDate":"Sep 1989","isNumber":"1256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"193","articleId":"29479","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":29484,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The authors explain the key steps and guidelines underlying the Theory W statement and its two subsidiary principles: plan the flight and fly the plan; and, identify and manage your risks. Theory W's fundamental principle holds that software project managers will be fully successful if and only if they make winners of all the other participants in the software process: superiors, subordinates, customers, users, maintainers, etc. Theory W characterizes a manager's primary role as a negotiator between his various constituencies, and a packager of project solutions with win conditions for all parties. Beyond this, the manager is also a goal-setter, a monitor of progress towards goals, and an activist in seeking out day-to-day win-lose or lose-lose project conflicts confronting them, and changing them into win-win situations. Several examples illustrate the application of Theory W. An extensive case study is presented and analyzed: the attempt to introduce new information systems to a large industrial corporation in an emerging nation. The analysis shows that Theory W and its subsidiary principles do an effective job both in explaining why the project encountered problems, and in prescribing ways in which the problems could have been avoided.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/29489/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1989","accessionNumber":"3444706","volume":"15","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Theory-W software project management principles and examples","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theory-W software project management principles and examples","sourcePdf":"00029489.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032982S","chronDate":"Jul 1989","isNumber":"1257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"240","articleId":"29489","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":29535,"authors":[{"name":"T.S.

It is thus considered a likely source of processing overhead. However, a preliminary examination has suggested to the authors that other aspects of networking may be a more serious source of overhead. To test this proposition, a detailed study was made of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), the transport protocol from the Internet protocol suite. In this set of protocols, the functions of detecting and recovering lost or corrupted packets, flow control, and multiplexing are performed at the transport level. The results of that study are presented. It is concluded that TCP is in fact not the source of the overhead often observed in packet processing, and that it could support very high speeds if properly implemented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analysis of TCP processing overhead","doi":"10.1109/35.29545","startPage":"23","endPage":"29","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.29545","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1262","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/35/1262/00029545.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=29545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/29545/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1989","displayDocTitle":"An analysis of TCP processing overhead","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"27","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1989","accessionNumber":"3466277","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analysis of TCP processing overhead","sourcePdf":"00029545.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037555S","chronDate":"June  1989","isNumber":"1262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"376","articleId":"29545","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":29554,"authors":[{"name":"G.S.

The model is one-third full size and is used with transient signals that have significant frequency content within the range 150 MHz to 1.5 GHz. A unique feature is that the soil in the model is represented by an emulsion, which is mixture of mineral oil, saline solution, and a stabilizing agent. This emulsion is a scale model for red clay soil; it matches the electrical parameters of the clay, including the dispersion in the conductivity, over a ten-to-one frequency range. Typical results measured with the model are discussed.

This corresponds to situations frequently encountered in areas such as geophysics, ultrasonic imaging, and nondestructive evaluation. Deconvolution of such signals is a detection-estimation problem that does not allow purely linear data processing, and the nature of the difficulties greatly depends on the type of representation chosen for the linear system. A MA degenerate state-space representation is used. It presents interesting algorithmic properties and simplifies implementation problems. To obtain a globally recursive procedure, a detection step is inserted in an estimation loop by Kalman filtering.

The synthesized architecture is a multibus multifunction unit processor matched to the implemented algorithm. The architecture has a linear topology and uses a lower number of interconnects and multiplexer inputs compared to other synthesized architectures with random topology having the same performance. The synthesized processor is a self-timed element externally, while it is internally synchronous. The methodology is implemented in a design aid tool called SPAID.

Often the time-delay estimates are corrupted by the presence of noise. By replacing each of the omnidirectional hydrophones with an array of hydrophones, and then cross-correlating the beamformed outputs of the arrays, the author shows that the effect of noise on the time-delay estimation process is reduced greatly. Both conventional and adaptive beamforming methods are implemented in the frequency domain and the advantages of array beamforming (prior to cross-correlation) are highlighted using both simulated and real noise-field data. Further improvement in the performance of the broadband cross-correlation processor occurs when various prefiltering algorithms are invoked.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/48.29601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1267","startPage":"238","endPage":"244","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/48/1267/00029601.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved time-delay estimates of underwater acoustic signals using beamforming and prefiltering techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/29601/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1989","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improved time-delay estimates of underwater acoustic signals using beamforming and prefiltering techniques","publicationDate":"July 1989","accessionNumber":"3477358","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"14","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved time-delay estimates of underwater acoustic signals using beamforming and prefiltering techniques","sourcePdf":"00029601.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036744S","chronDate":"Jul 1989","isNumber":"1267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"29","articleId":"29601","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":29611,"authors":[{"name":"G.D.

The gain in SNR efficiency of a multidimensional constellation (lattice code) consisting of the points from a lattice Lambda within a region R compared to a cubic constellation is shown to be approximately separable into the coding gain of Lambda and the shape gain of R, for large constellations. Similarly, the expansion of the associated constituent 2-D constellation is shown to be approximately separable into a constellation expansion ratio (CER) coding component CER/sub c/( Lambda ) and a shaping component CER/sub s/(R). The N sphere is the region R with the best shape gain, but N also has large constellation expansion. Bounds for the best possible shape gain versus CER/sub s/(R) or peak-to-average-power ratio (PAR) are given. Generalized cross constellations are discussed. These constellations yield a modest shape gain with very low CER/sub s/(R) or PAR, are easily implemented, are well suited for use with coded QAM modems, and can be readily adapted to support an opportunistic secondary channel.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.29611","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00029611.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.29611","startPage":"877","endPage":"892","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/1268/00029611.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multidimensional constellations.

An algebraic approach is adopted in which the basic modulation signals are associated with the elements of a finite group. Using some of the properties of group partition chains, the algebraic properties of the linear codes are studied. From this analysis, a class of codes called blocked coset codes is obtained. Distance properties of the block coset codes are obtained in terms of the distance properties of the underlying group partition chain. A particular choice of coset representations yields the standard block coset code construction, which is applicable to M-PSK for M of the form 2/sup k/*3/sup l/. The standard block coset code construction is seen to be equivalent to block code constructions previously reported in the literature, and it is modified to account for the fact that the 4-PSK constellation forms a Hamming space. The modification results in substantial improvements in some cases.

II. Voronoi constellations","abstract":"For pt.I see ibid., vol.7, no.6, p.877-92 (1989). Voronoi constellations, also called Voronoi codes are implementable N-dimensional constellations based on partitions of N-dimensional lattices ( Lambda ) that can achieve good shape gains and that are inherently suited for use with coded modulation. Two methods are given for specifying Voronoi constellations on the basis of arbitrary lattice partitions Lambda / Lambda /sub s/, where Lambda /sub s/, the shaping lattice, is an N-dimensional sublattice of Lambda . One of the methods is conjectured to be optimum, and the other has desirable symmetries and naturally supports opportunistic secondary channels. When Lambda and Lambda /sub s/ are 2-D-symmetric, the constituent 2-D constellation is itself a Voronoi constellation. The shaping constellation expansion ratio and peak-to-average-power ratio are determined in general and for various Lambda /sub s/. Methods for labeling Voronoi constellations are given. Their complexity is shown to be dominated by that of decoding Lambda /sub s/. It is also shown that coding and shaping are separable and dual. Bounds on the shape gain of Voronoi constellations are given that depend on the depth and normalized informativity of Lambda /sub s/. These bounds suggest the use of lattices Lambda with depth 2 and normalized informativity less than 1, which can achieve near-optimal shape gains with reduced constellation expansion and implementation complexity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/29616/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","volume":"7","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"3475174","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multidimensional constellations.

The algorithm is a suboptimum decoding scheme and, in the range of signal-to-noise-power-density ratios of interest, its BER performance is only a few tenths of a dB inferior to the performance of the MLD for the codes examined.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.29620","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/1268/00029620.pdf","startPage":"982","endPage":"988","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00029620.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.29620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closest coset decoding of mod u mod u+v mod codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","displayDocTitle":"Closest coset decoding of mod u mod u+v mod codes","volume":"7","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3475178","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/29620/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closest coset decoding of mod u mod u+v mod codes","sourcePdf":"00029620.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024681S","chronDate":"Aug 1989","isNumber":"1268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"31","articleId":"29620","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":29621,"authors":[{"name":"M.V.

A well-structured reduced-state sequence estimation (RSSE) algorithm is described which can achieve the performance of maximum-likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) with drastically reduced complexity. Well-defined reduced-state trellises are first constructed by merging the states of the ML supertrellis using set partitioning principles. Then the Viterbi algorithm is used to search these trellises. A special case of RSSE, called parallel decision-feedback decoding, uses the encoder trellis, yet on channels with large attenuation distortion it can provide a significantly better performance than linear equalization. The performance of RSSE is examined analytically and through simulation, and then compared to that of MLSE and ideal decision-feedback equalization. It is noted that the performance advantage of RSSE can be obtained without significantly increasing the decoding delay or complicating an adaptive implementation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/29621/","volume":"7","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"3475179","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-state sequence estimation for coded modulation of intersymbol interference channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-state sequence estimation for coded modulation of intersymbol interference channels","sourcePdf":"00029621.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035407S","chronDate":"Aug 1989","isNumber":"1268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"163","articleId":"29621","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":29623,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Filtered continuous phase modulations (CPM) are the particular object of study. A state-variable approach is used for defining the decoder tree. Maximum likelihood sequence estimation requires exhaustive tree searching, which is restricted by using the (M, L) algorithm since this approach does not require that the channel intersymbol interference be finite. After briefly describing the (M, L) algorithm, the authors motivate the problem of equalization of infinite-impulse-response channels by considering the performance of a discrete-time single-pole channel filtering a binary input sequence. The state variable description of a linear system is used to analyze the filtered modulation. The state of the filtered modulation for a given input modulation is used to define the tree structure of the filtered signal upon which the (M, L) algorithm operates. The minimum signal space distance results for several filtered CPM schemes are then summarized. Extensive simulation results are presented, and comparisons to the optimal performance are made.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.29623","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00029623.png","startPage":"1006","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/1268/00029623.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.29623","endPage":"1016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoding of severely filtered modulation codes using the (M, L) algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/29623/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","displayDocTitle":"Decoding of severely filtered modulation codes using the (M, L) algorithm","volume":"7","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3475181","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoding of severely filtered modulation codes using the (M, L) algorithm","sourcePdf":"00029623.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034806S","chronDate":"Aug 1989","isNumber":"1268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"22","articleId":"29623","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":29626,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.F.

At the maximum output power of 13 mW, obtained with a pump power of 75 mW, the emission linewidth is still as broad as 16 nm, and the pump-to-signal conversion efficiency approaches the quantum limit of 78%. A simple model of superfluorescence in fibers, which relates the source emission characteristics to the fiber single-pass gain, is also presented. The single-pass gain, measured to be 0.27 dB/mW, was used to fit the model to the data. A good agreement is found for the nonlinear output versus input power curves of the sources, but it appears that the emission linewidth does not narrow with increasing pump power as fast as expected. Based on these results and an existing model of gain in single-mode fibers, it is suggested that simple improvements in the fiber design may reduce the pump requirement of this source and make laser-diode pumping possible.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.29626","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00029626.png","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/1269/00029626.pdf","startPage":"1009","endPage":"1015","doi":"10.1109/50.29626","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of a 1060-nm Nd:SiO/sub 2/ superfluorescent fiber laser","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1989","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of a 1060-nm Nd:SiO/sub 2/ superfluorescent fiber laser","volume":"7","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1989","accessionNumber":"3475689","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/29626/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of a 1060-nm Nd:SiO/sub 2/ superfluorescent fiber laser","sourcePdf":"00029626.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026558S","chronDate":"Jul 1989","isNumber":"1269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"21","articleId":"29626","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":29627,"authors":[{"name":"K.T.

The power spectrum of the photocurrent resulting from two uncorrelated optical beams mixing on a photodetector is derived. In particular, a rigorous analysis is presented for the delayed self-homodyne method which is used to characterize laser source linewidth by a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a delay exceeding the source coherence length. Existing treatments are generalized to address non-Lorentzian laser sources of arbitrary lineshape. The analysis is further generalized to cover the case of modulated nonstationary sources. An example of the application of this theory is given. It is shown how the theory may be used to interpret an experimental result obtained using the gated delayed self-homodyne technique for characterizing the frequency chirp of laser sources under modulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/29635/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1989","volume":"7","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3475697","displayDocTitle":"Spectral analysis of optical mixing measurements","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral analysis of optical mixing measurements","sourcePdf":"00029635.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036876S","chronDate":"Jul 1989","isNumber":"1269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"72","articleId":"29635","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":29639,"authors":[{"name":"K.

When the amplifier is gain-saturated, the gain of any channel is influenced by the light intensity of the other channels, which causes channel crosstalk in intensity-modulated multiplexing transmission. On-off-keying modulation systems with more than two channels are discussed. Considering the probability distribution, the power penalty due to crosstalk is presented for practical system design.

The ratio of NH/sub 4/OH in the solution can be reduced down to 1/10 of the standard ratio while keeping high removal efficiency. By decreasing the NH/sub 4/OH content, wafer damage which appears as a so-called haze during the NH/sub 4/OH-H/sub 2/O/sub 2/ treatment is reduced. To establish a particle-free wafer drying system, a particle-generation-free isopropanol (IPA) vapor drying system has been developed. By eliminating all possible particle generation sources from the drying system, ultraclean wafer drying equipment has been realized. A number of parameters to be controlled have been thoroughly investigated. Three were found to seriously influence surface cleanliness after drying: the water content in the IPA, temperature distribution around the wafers, and the IPA vapor velocity.

It is based on a statistical model of parametric process variation. In this Monte-Carlo-based approach, a statistical process simulation is used together with circuit simulation to determine the joint probability distribution of a set of circuit performances. By evaluating the joint probability distribution, rather than assuming the performances to be independent, correlations that exist between them are used to reduce the number of performances that need to be explicitly tested. Once a subset of performances for explicit testing has been identified, regression models are constructed for the untested performances, and from the confidence intervals test limits are assigned for the tested performances. In this manner, the values of the untested performances within desired quality levels are predicted, reducing test complexity and cost.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/66.29679","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/66.29679","startPage":"104","endPage":"113","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel3/66/1273/00029679.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1273","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00029679.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictive subset testing: optimizing IC parametric performance testing for quality, cost, and yield","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","displayDocTitle":"Predictive subset testing: optimizing IC parametric performance testing for quality, cost, and yield","publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"2","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3480192","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/29679/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive subset testing: optimizing IC parametric performance testing for quality, cost, and yield","sourcePdf":"00029679.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034437S","chronDate":"Aug 1989","isNumber":"1273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"56","articleId":"29679","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":29680,"authors":[{"name":"R.V.

It is assumed that the wafer under test is not necessarily in its proper orientation. It is required that certain probes be lowered automatically onto certain pads to inject test vectors and to read the results for analysis. A methodology was developed for determining the position (especially the vertical distance from the target) of the tip of a probe, so that it can be guided accurately to its target pad. Standard image processing steps used for efficient feature extraction and registration of the target integrated circuit are outlined, and a method of obtaining the vertical distance of the tip of a probe from its target pad is presented. Two different criteria through which it can be established whether a probe is in contact with its target are given. The algorithm developed was tested for touch using different types of tips such as tungsten and tungsten carbide, and with NMOS and CMOS processes. Clean and accurate representations of the probes were extracted from integrated images in all the tests, and in all cases, touch was achieved without the surface being scratched.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/66.29680","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel3/66/1273/00029680.pdf","startPage":"114","endPage":"117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/66.29680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Micromanipulator vision for wafer probing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=29680","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/29680/","displayDocTitle":"Micromanipulator vision for wafer probing","volume":"2","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","accessionNumber":"3480193","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Micromanipulator vision for wafer probing","sourcePdf":"00029680.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033867S","chronDate":"Aug 1989","isNumber":"1273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"2","articleId":"29680","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":29685,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.

Tracking requirements can be relaxed or eliminated, and real estate and system power requirements may be substantially reduced. However, the available propagation margins are limited, particularly at frequencies above 10 GHz.

Circuits implementing several different neural algorithms, namely, template matching, associative memory, learning, and two-dimensional resistor networks inspired by the architecture of the retina are discussed. The most mature circuits are those for template matching, and chips performing this function are now being applied to pattern-recognition problems.
