In this work, we focus on the use of context information to achieve energy-efficient, ubiquitous wireless connectivity. Our field-collected data show that the energy cost of network interfaces poses a great challenge to ubiquitous connectivity, despite decent availability of cellular networks. We propose to leverage the complementary strengths of Wi-Fi and cellular interfaces by automatically selecting the most efficient one based on context information. We formulate the selection of wireless interfaces as a statistical decision problem. The challenge is to accurately estimate Wi-Fi network conditions without powering up the network interface. We explore the use of different context information, including time, history, cellular network conditions, and device motion, to statistically estimate Wi-Fi network conditions with negligible overhead. We evaluate several context-based algorithms for the estimation and prediction of current and future network conditions. Simulations using field-collected traces show that our network estimation algorithms can improve the average battery lifetime of a commercial mobile phone for an ECG reporting application by 40 percent, very close to the estimated theoretical upper bound of 42 percent. Furthermore, our most effective algorithm can predict Wi-Fi availability for one and ten hours into the future with 95 and 90 percent accuracy, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5530318/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5530318/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11654742","volume":"10","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Context-Based Network Estimation for Energy-Efficient Ubiquitous Wireless Connectivity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Context-Based Network Estimation for Energy-Efficient Ubiquitous Wireless Connectivity","sourcePdf":"ttm2011010054.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073767S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5640589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5640589","articleId":"5530318","onlineDate":"29 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5530324,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Bowman","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/32/5644729/5530324/5530324-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michael Bowman received the bachelor of software engineering degree from the Department of Systems and Computer Engineering at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, and the master of applied science degree in 2007.

Though there are many methodologies for assigning responsibilities to classes, they all rely on human judgment and decision making. Our objective is to provide decision-making support to reassign methods and attributes to classes in a class diagram. Our solution is based on a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) and uses class coupling and cohesion measurement for defining fitness functions. Our MOGA takes as input a class diagram to be optimized and suggests possible improvements to it. The choice of a MOGA stems from the fact that there are typically many evaluation criteria that cannot be easily combined into one objective, and several alternative solutions are acceptable for a given OO domain model. Using a carefully selected case study, this paper investigates the application of our proposed MOGA to the class responsibility assignment problem, in the context of object-oriented analysis and domain class models. Our results suggest that the MOGA can help correct suboptimal class responsibility assignment decisions and perform far better than simpler alternative heuristics such as hill climbing and a single-objective GA.","doi":"10.1109/TSE.2010.70","pdfPath":"/iel5/32/5644729/05530324.pdf","startPage":"817","endPage":"837","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2010.70","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5644729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solving the Class Responsibility Assignment Problem in Object-Oriented Analysis with Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5530324/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Solving the Class Responsibility Assignment Problem in Object-Oriented Analysis with Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms","volume":"36","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11673960","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5530324/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving the Class Responsibility Assignment Problem in Object-Oriented Analysis with Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms","sourcePdf":"tts2010060817.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.187263S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"5644729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"5644729","articleId":"5530324","onlineDate":"29 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5530325,"authors":[{"name":"Nir Kshetri","affiliation":["Bryan School of Business and Economics, North Carolina State University, Greensboro, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Nir Kshetri is an associate professor at the Bryan School of Business and Economics at the University of North Carolina-Greensboro.

The biochemical analyses are performed by repeatedly moving, mixing, and splitting droplets on the electrodes. Mixers and storage units, composed of electrodes, are two important functional resources. Mixers perform droplet mixing and splitting operations, while storage units store droplets that have been produced for subsequent mixings. In this paper, we focus on minimizing the completion time of biochemical analyses by exploiting the binary tree representation of analyses to schedule mixing operations. Using pipelining, we overlap mixing operations with input and transportation operations. We find the lower bound of the mixing completion time based on the tree structure of input analyses, and calculate the minimum number of mixers \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Mlb</i>\n required to achieve the lower bound.

We also analyze resource constraint issues for two extreme cases. For the case with just one mixer, we prove that all schedules that keep the mixer busy at all times result in the same mixing completion time and then design algorithms for scheduling and to minimize the number of storage units. For the case with zero storage units, we find the minimum number of mixers required. We extend our analyses and algorithms assuming identical mixing durations to the case of different mixing durations. Finally, we illustrate the benefits of our scheduling methods on an example of DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5530338/","volume":"8","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5530338/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11727146","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Scheduling of Biochemical Analyses on Digital Microfluidic Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Scheduling of Biochemical Analyses on Digital Microfluidic Systems","sourcePdf":"tase-akella-2053201-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099503S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"5676406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5676406","articleId":"5530338","onlineDate":"29 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5530339,"authors":[{"name":"Dragan Jovcic","affiliation":["University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Dragan Jovcic (S'97\u2013M'00\u2013SM'06) received the D.Eng. degree in control engineering from the University of Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in 1993 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Auckland, New Zealand, in 1999.","He was a Visiting Professor with McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, in 2008.

There has been much research on dc/dc converters and it is likely that some megawatt size units will achieve commercialisation stage soon. In this study, we assume that electronic dc transformers can achieve three functions: 1) voltage stepping, 2) voltage (or power) regulation, and 3) fault isolation. The location, sizing, and control of dc transformers is first analyzed using a simple 4-terminal, 1.8 GW dc grid. It is postulated that this grid would be a better alternative to a point-to-point HVDC. Detailed simulations on PSCAD/EMTDC demonstrate the capability to independently regulate power flow in each dc branch. The simulations of worst case faults on dc lines and ac grids show that dc transformers can isolate the faulted segments enabling the remaining part of the grid to operate normally. The generic principles of developing more complex dc grids with meshed power flows, are also presented. It is concluded that there are no significant technical barriers in developing dc transmission grids but the cost and losses of dc transformers remain as the primary challenges.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5570058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2010.2052074","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5570058/05530339.pdf","startPage":"2535","endPage":"2543","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2010.2052074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Developing DC Transmission Networks Using DC Transformers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Developing DC Transmission Networks Using DC Transformers","volume":"25","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5530339/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11534276","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5530339/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Developing DC Transmission Networks Using DC Transformers","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-djovcic-2052074-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049391S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5570058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"5570058","articleId":"5530339","onlineDate":"29 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5530341,"authors":[{"name":"Athanasios G.

Also, the relaxed power injection limits and the lower noise power levels characterizing underground MV/BPL transmission counteract the extremely high inherent attenuation, making the capacity achieved compatible to that achieved in overhead MV/BPL transmission.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2010.2052113","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5570058/05530341.pdf","startPage":"2425","endPage":"2434","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2010.2052113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5570058","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadband Transmission via Underground Medium-Voltage Power Lines\u2014Part II: Capacity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5530341","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5530341/","displayDocTitle":"Broadband Transmission via Underground Medium-Voltage Power Lines\u2014Part II: Capacity","volume":"25","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11534277","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5530341/","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadband Transmission via Underground Medium-Voltage Power Lines\u2014Part II: Capacity","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-lazaropoulos-2052113-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122824S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5570058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5570058","articleId":"5530341","onlineDate":"29 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5530345,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Hong Mao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xiao Hong","lastName":"Mao","id":"37401838600"},{"name":"Yee Hui Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yee Hui","lastName":"Lee","id":"37293397600"},{"name":"Boon Chong Ng","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Boon Chong","lastName":"Ng","id":"38193166800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"5530345","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":219},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shafts","Antenna measurements","Antennas and propagation","Laboratories","Testing","Weibull distribution","Buildings","Marine vehicles","Production facilities","Narrowband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor communication","lifts","shafts","signal processing","Weibull distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal variation","propagating waves","lift shaft","Akaike information criterion","Weibull function","Kolmogorov-Smirnov test","lift door","lift car","channel propagation","dynamic channel","static channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC)-based method","lift shaft","temporal variation","UHF band","Weibull distribution"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Modeling of Signal Variation for Propagation Along a Lift Shaft","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2010.2061831","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5423326","endPage":"755","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/5423326/05530345.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2010.2061831","startPage":"752","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5530345","abstract":"Temporal variation on the tapped amplitude of propagating waves along a lift shaft in a complex campus environment is presented and modeled statistically in this letter.

Neural-network subpixel-classification performance is directly related to the network-training protocols used. This letter examined early stopping criteria for network training of subpixel land-cover classification. A new stopping criterion is proposed that is based on the reduction of mean squared error (MSE) for a validation data set. We obtained excellent results by stopping the network training when the reduction of MSE between training iterations became marginal. Furthermore, the neural-network learning rate can be used as a threshold value to identify the stopping point. The approach appeared to be robust for both simulation data and actual remote-sensing data. Use of this criterion outperformed two other commonly used stopping criteria: a predefined number of training iterations and a cross-validation approach.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2010.2052782","startPage":"113","endPage":"117","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/5673451/05530351.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2010.2052782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5673451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Early Stopping Criteria for Neural-Network-Based Subpixel Classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Remote sensing","Protocols","Error analysis","Satellites","Robustness","Neural networks","Multilayer perceptrons","Bayesian methods","Geography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","image classification","mean square error methods","neural nets","terrain mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["early stopping criteria","spectral mixture problems","network training protocol","subpixel land-cover classification","mean squared error reduction","validation data set","training iteration","neural network learning rate","remote sensing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Early stopping criterion","neural network","subpixel classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5530351/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Early Stopping Criteria for Neural-Network-Based Subpixel Classification","volume":"8","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5530351/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11704546","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Early Stopping Criteria for Neural-Network-Based Subpixel Classification","sourcePdf":"lgrs-shao-2052782-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085648S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"5673451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5673451","articleId":"5530351","onlineDate":"29 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5530357,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenxing Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Zhenxing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404934800"},{"name":"Lei Xu","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Xu","id":"37279486200"},{"name":"John Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Chang","id":"37406508000"},{"name":"Ting Wang","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Ting","lastName":"Wang","id":"37291229700"},{"name":"Paul R.

All the recordings were done simultaneously with full-night polysomnography during sleep. The sound activity episodes were identified using the vertical box (V-Box) algorithm. The 500-Hz subband energy distribution and principal component analysis were used to extract discriminative features from sound episodes. An unsupervised fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm was then deployed to label the sound episodes as either snore or no-snore class, which could be breath sound, swallowing sound, or any other noise. The algorithm was evaluated using manual annotation of the sound signals. The overall accuracy of the proposed algorithm was found to be 98.6% for tracheal sounds recordings, and 93.1% for the sounds recorded by the ambient microphone.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5530359/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5530359/","dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11960382","pubMedId":"20679022","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Automatic and Unsupervised Snore Sound Extraction From Respiratory Sound Signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic and Unsupervised Snore Sound Extraction From Respiratory Sound Signals","sourcePdf":"tbme-moussavi-2061846-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136203S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5752399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"5752399","articleId":"5530359","onlineDate":"29 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5530364,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Starting from the resolution requirements, spatial sampling criteria for nonmonochromatic waves are investigated. Exploring the decisive influence of the system's fractional bandwidth (instead of previously claimed aperture sparsity) on the imaging capabilities of sparse aperture arrays, a MIMO linear array is designed based on the principle of effective aperture. For the antenna array, an optimized UWB antenna is designed allowing for distortionless impulse radiation with more than 150% fractional bandwidth. By combining the digital beamforming in the MIMO array with the SAR in the orthogonal direction, a high-resolution 3-D volumetric imaging system with a significantly reduced number of antenna elements is proposed. The proposed imaging system is experimentally verified against the conventional 2-D SAR under different conditions, including a typical concealed-weapon-detection scenario. The imaging results confirm the correctness of the proposed system design and show a strong potential of the MIMO-SAR-based UWB system for security applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5673441/05530374.pdf","startPage":"509","endPage":"518","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2053038","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2053038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5673441","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5530374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Sparse Aperture MIMO-SAR-Based UWB Imaging System for Concealed Weapon Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Apertures","Weapons","High-resolution imaging","MIMO","Bandwidth","Linear antenna arrays","Ultra wideband antennas","Antenna arrays","Radar detection","Ultra wideband technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO radar","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar","ultra wideband radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse aperture MIMO-SAR-based UWB imaging system","concealed weapon detection","high-resolution imaging system","ultrawideband transmission","multiple-input-multiple-output array","MIMO array","synthetic aperture radar","nonmonochromatic waves","sparse aperture arrays","MIMO linear array","antenna array","optimized UWB antenna","distortionless impulse radiation","3D volumetric imaging system","2D SAR","concealed-weapon-detection scenario","MIMO-SAR-based UWB system","security applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Concealed weapon detection (CWD)","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO)","sparse aperture antenna array","synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","ultrawideband (UWB)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5530374/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Sparse Aperture MIMO-SAR-Based UWB Imaging System for Concealed Weapon Detection","volume":"49","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5530374/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11704619","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Sparse Aperture MIMO-SAR-Based UWB Imaging System for Concealed Weapon Detection","sourcePdf":"tgrs-zhuge-2053038-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069125S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5673441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"235","xplore-issue":"5673441","articleId":"5530374","onlineDate":"29 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5530376,"authors":[{"name":"Hicham Fakham","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electrical Engineering and Power Electronic of Lille, Ecole Centrale de Lille, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5662271/5530376/5530376-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hicham Fakham received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Versailles, Versailles, France, in 2006.","In 2006, he joined the Laboratory of Electrical Engineering and Power Electronic of Lille (L2EP), Ecole Centrale de Lille, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France.

The main practical problem of having high-gain-based design is that it amplifies the input and output disturbance as well as excites hidden unmodeled dynamics, causing poor tracking performance. In this paper, a multiple model/control-based SMC technique is proposed to reduce the level of parametric uncertainty to reduce observer-controller gains. To this end, we split uniformly the compact set of unknown parameters into a finite number of smaller compact subsets. Then, we design a candidate SMC corresponding to each of these smaller subsets. The derivative of the Lyapunov function candidate is used as a resetting criterion to identify a candidate model that approximates closely the plant at each instant of time. The key idea is to allow the parameter estimate of conventional adaptive sliding mode control design to be reset into a model that best estimates the plant among a finite set of candidate models. The proposed method is evaluated on a 2-DOF robot manipulator to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical development.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2062472","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5765746/05530377.pdf","startPage":"2444","endPage":"2453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2062472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5765746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Sliding Mode Control for Robot Manipulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Robust Sliding Mode Control for Robot Manipulators","volume":"58","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2011","accessionNumber":"11988564","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5530377/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5530377/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Sliding Mode Control for Robot Manipulators","sourcePdf":"tie-islam-2062472-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086421S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5765746","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"206","xplore-issue":"5765746","articleId":"5530377","onlineDate":"29 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5530379,"authors":[{"name":"Lu\u00eds Romeral","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department UPC, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5747179/5530379/5530379-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lu\u00eds Romeral (M'98) received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree from Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya (UPC), Barcelona, Spain, in 1985 and 1995, respectively.","In 1988, he joined the Department of Electronic Engineering, UPC, where he is currently an Associate Professor and the Director of the Motion and Industrial Control Group, whose major research activities concern induction and permanent magnet motor drives, enhanced efficiency drives, fault detection and diagnosis of electrical motor drives, and improvement of educational tools.

The question to be answered in this research is whether or not ridge depth information improves the quality and matching capability of acquired fingerprints? For evaluation of this question, we use the National Institute of Standards and Technology fingerprint image quality metrics. These metrics require the 3-D prints to be flattened. We present a complete and detailed flattening algorithm based upon unfolding an elastic tube fit to the peaks and valleys of ridges identified within the scan. Further improvement of the flattened print is achieved through the incorporation of ridge information extracted from the albedo image with the depth and albedo ridge information fused together according to local scan quality. Our study compares image quality between the flattened 3-D prints and ink rolled prints. Most significantly, the matching performance of 3-D flattened to 3-D flattened prints is evaluated based on ridge depth only, albedo only, and depth with albedo fusion.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2010.2062177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2010.2062177","startPage":"750","endPage":"760","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/5623286/05530380.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5623286","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data Acquisition and Processing of 3-D Fingerprints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Data Acquisition and Processing of 3-D Fingerprints","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","volume":"5","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5530380/","accessionNumber":"11641634","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5530380/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Acquisition and Processing of 3-D Fingerprints","sourcePdf":"tifs-hassebrook-2062177-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07842S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"5623286","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5623286","articleId":"5530380","onlineDate":"29 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5530381,"authors":[{"name":"Jim Aarestad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/5623286/5530381/5530381-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jim Aarestad (S'09) recieved the Associate's Degree in applied science from the North Dakota State College of Science, the Bachelor's Degree in computer engineering from the University of New Mexico (UNM), and is currently conducting VLSI and hardware security research as a Master's degree graduate student at UNM.","He has served for one year as the Treasurer of the UNM Chapter of IEEE.

Hardware Trojans are deliberate and malicious modifications to the logic function implemented within digital and mixed signal chips. In contrast to software Trojans, it is not possible to simply \"scan the hard drive\" to eradicate a hardware Trojan. Hardware Trojans can be designed to shutdown the chip at some predetermined time and/or when some specific signal or data pattern is received. They may also be designed to remain hidden while leaking confidential information covertly to the adversary. Determining whether a hardware Trojan has been inserted into a chip is extremely difficult for a variety of reasons, e.g., nanometer feature sizes and chip design complexity combine to make optical inspection difficult or impossible. This paper presents experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of a Trojan detection method that is based on the analysis of a chip's Jddqs (steady-state current), which are measured simultaneously from multiple places on the chip. The proposed method also incorporates a technique for virtually eliminating process and test environment variations effects which act to reduce detection sensitivity of traditional testing approaches. Used together, resolution enhancements of up to a 1000 x are possible over conventional single power supply current measurement techniques. A regression-based statistical technique is applied to the data collected from a set of chips fabricated in a 65-nm process to illustrate the detection capabilities and limitations of this type of approach.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5623286","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/5623286/05530381.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2010.2061228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2010.2061228","startPage":"893","endPage":"904","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting Trojans Through Leakage Current Analysis Using Multiple Supply Pad -s","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5530381/","displayDocTitle":"Detecting Trojans Through Leakage Current Analysis Using Multiple Supply Pad <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">${I}_{\\rm DDQ}$</tex></formula>s","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5530381/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"5","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"11641625","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting Trojans Through Leakage Current Analysis Using Multiple Supply Pad <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">${I}_{\\rm DDQ}$</tex></formula>s","sourcePdf":"tifs-plusquellic-2061228-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063087S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"5623286","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"5623286","articleId":"5530381","onlineDate":"29 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5530382,"authors":[{"name":"Giacomo Boracchi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Giacomo","lastName":"Boracchi","id":"37395317100"},{"name":"Alessandro Foi","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Foi","id":"37294575400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0042"}],"articleNumber":"5530382","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1254},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5530382","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image restoration","Noise level","Signal restoration","Deconvolution","Digital cameras","Optical imaging","Digital images","Permission","Performance analysis","Mathematical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","image motion analysis","image restoration","mean square error methods","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uniform motion blur","Poissonian noise","blur-noise tradeoff","image restoration","image formation model","blur point-spread function","noise level","root mean squared error","signal-to-noise ratio","Fourier domain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blur modeling","deconvolution","digital camera imaging","image restoration","noise modeling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIP.2010.2062196","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5688261/05530382.pdf","startPage":"592","endPage":"598","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2010.2062196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5688261","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uniform Motion Blur in Poissonian Noise: Blur/Noise Tradeoff","abstract":"In this paper we consider the restoration of images corrupted by both uniform motion blur and Poissonian noise.

The design objective is to strike a balance between the bias and variance of the prediction errors in the MDL criterion. The predictor design problem is particularly interesting and challenging for multidimensional signals (e.g., images and videos) because of the increased degree of freedom in choosing the predictor support. Our main result is a new technique of sequentializing a multidimensional signal into a sequence of nested contexts of increasing order to facilitate the MDL search for the order and the support shape of the predictor, and the sequentialization is made adaptive on a sample by sample basis. The proposed MDL-based adaptive predictor is applied to lossless image coding, and its performance is empirically established to be the best among all the results that have been published till

comparing the lens' opacity severity in his/her slit-lamp images with a set of standard photos. This grading scheme is often subjective and time-consuming. In this paper, a novel computer-aided diagnosis method via ranking is proposed to facilitate nuclear cataract grading following conventional clinical decision-making process. The grade of nuclear cataract in a slit-lamp image is predicted using its neighboring labeled images in a ranked image list, which is achieved using a learned ranking function. This ranking function is learned via direct optimization on a newly proposed approximation to a ranking evaluation measure. Our proposed method has been evaluated by a large dataset composed of 1000 different cases, which are collected from an ongoing clinical population-based study. Both experimental results and comparison with several existing methods demonstrate the benefit of grading via ranking by our proposed method.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/5676464/05530401.pdf","startPage":"94","endPage":"107","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Computer Assisted Method for Nuclear Cataract Grading From Slit-Lamp Images Using Ranking","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2010.2062197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5676464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2010.2062197","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5530401","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5530401/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","displayDocTitle":"A Computer Assisted Method for Nuclear Cataract Grading From Slit-Lamp Images Using Ranking","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11727994","pubMedId":"20679026","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"30","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5530401/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Computer Assisted Method for Nuclear Cataract Grading From Slit-Lamp Images Using Ranking","sourcePdf":"tmi-huang-2062197-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093895S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"5676464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5676464","articleId":"5530401","onlineDate":"29 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5530413,"authors":[{"name":"Jessie Y.

In particular, two-way relaying is known to exploit the radio resources in a very efficient manner. In this contribution, we consider two-way relaying with amplify-and-forward (AF) MIMO relays. Since AF relays do not decode the signals, the separation of the data streams has to be performed by the terminals themselves. For this task both nodes require reliable channel knowledge of all relevant channel parameters. Therefore, we examine channel estimation schemes for two-way relaying with AF MIMO relays. We investigate a simple Least Squares (LS) based scheme for the estimation of the compound channels as well as a tensor-based channel estimation (TENCE) scheme which takes advantage of the special structure in the compound channel matrices to further improve the estimation accuracy. Note that TENCE is purely algebraic (i.e., it does not require any iterative procedures) and applicable to arbitrary antenna configurations. Then we demonstrate that the solution obtained by TENCE can be improved by an iterative refinement which is based on the structured least squares (SLS) technique. In this application, between one and four iterations are sufficient and consequently the increase in computational complexity is moderate. The iterative refinement is optional and targeted for cases where the channel estimation accuracy is critical. Moreover, we propose design rules for the training symbols as well as the relay amplification matrices during the training phase to facilitate the estimation procedures. Finally, we evaluate the achievable channel estimation accuracy of the LS-based compound channel estimation scheme as well as the tensor-based approach and its iterative refinement via numerical computer simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2062179","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5599326/05530416.pdf","startPage":"5720","endPage":"5735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5599326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2062179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tensor-Based Channel Estimation and Iterative Refinements for Two-Way Relaying With Multiple Antennas and Spatial Reuse","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5530416/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Tensor-Based Channel Estimation and Iterative Refinements for Two-Way Relaying With Multiple Antennas and Spatial Reuse","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5530416/","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11575491","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tensor-Based Channel Estimation and Iterative Refinements for Two-Way Relaying With Multiple Antennas and Spatial Reuse","sourcePdf":"tsp-roemer-2062179-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104728S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5599326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"5599326","articleId":"5530416","onlineDate":"29 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5530417,"authors":[{"name":"Jiaheng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"p":["Jiaheng Wang (S'08) received the B.E. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2001 and 2006, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2010.

We consider low-complexity pre-fixed receivers that may adapt to the channel but are oblivious to the existence of a precoder at the transmitter. In particular, three types of CSI are taken into account: i) perfect CSI, ii) statistical CSI in the form of mean feedback, and iii) deterministic imperfect CSI assuming that the actual channel is within the neighborhood of a nominal channel, which leads to the worst-case robust design that is the focus of this paper. Interestingly, it is found that, under some mild conditions, the optimal transmit directions, i.e., the left singular vectors of the precoder, are equal to the right singular vectors of the channel, the channel mean, and the nominal channel for perfect CSI, statistical CSI, and the worst-case design, respectively. Consequently, the matrix-valued problems can be simplified to scalar power allocation problems that either admit closed-form solutions or can be efficiently solved by the proposed algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5599326/05530417.pdf","startPage":"5802","endPage":"5818","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2062178","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2062178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5599326","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5530417","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust MMSE Precoding in MIMO Channels With Pre-Fixed Receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","MIMO","Transmitters","Channel state information","Feedback","Permission","Stochastic processes","Mean square error methods","Minimax techniques","Design optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least mean squares methods","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","precoding","radio receivers","vectors","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust MMSE precoding","MIMO channel","minimum mean square error criterion","channel state information","multiple-input multiple-output channel","low-complexity pre-fixed receiver","singular vector","statistical CSI","matrix-valued problem","scalar power allocation problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convex optimization","imperfect CSI","MIMO","MMSE","minimax","robust precoders","worst-case designs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5530417/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Robust MMSE Precoding in MIMO Channels With Pre-Fixed Receivers","volume":"58","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5530417/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11575492","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust MMSE Precoding in MIMO Channels With Pre-Fixed Receivers","sourcePdf":"tsp-wang-2062178-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154971S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5599326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5599326","articleId":"5530417","onlineDate":"29 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5530418,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This process of control for energy system components is known as energy management. In this paper, the application of particle swarm optimization (PSO), which is a biologically inspired direct search method, to find real-time optimal energy management solutions for a stand-alone hybrid wind-microturbine (MT) energy system, is presented. Results demonstrate that the proposed PSO-based energy management algorithm can solve an extensive solution space while incorporating many objectives such as: minimizing the cost of generated electricity, maximizing MT operational efficiency, and reducing environmental emissions. Actual wind and end-use load data were used for simulation studies and the well-established sequential quadratic programming optimization technique was used to validate the results obtained from PSO. Promising simulation results indicate the suitability of PSO for real-time energy management of hybrid energy systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5530418/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11533764","htmlLink":"/document/5530418/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Energy Management of a Stand-Alone Hybrid Wind-Microturbine Energy System Using Particle Swarm Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Energy Management of a Stand-Alone Hybrid Wind-Microturbine Energy System Using Particle Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"tste-nehrir-2061881-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077041S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"5165391","isNumber":"5563518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"5563518","articleId":"5530418","onlineDate":"29 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5530423,"authors":[{"name":"Kamrul Hakim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5578601/5530423/5530423-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kamrul Hakim (S'06) received his B.Sc. degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), Dhaka, Bangladesh in 2005 and M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from The Pennsylvania State University - University Park, USA in 2008.

Dynamic Spectrum Leasing (DSL), proposed in allows active participation of both primary and secondary users in the spectrum sharing process. Motivated by network spectrum utilization considerations, we propose generalizations to the primary system utility function defined in and a new utility function for the secondary users. We also generalize the proposed non-cooperative C-DSL game to allow for linear multiuser detectors at the secondary base stations. We formulate the conditions on the primary system and the secondary user utility functions so that the proposed C-DSL game has desired equilibrium properties. We prove that the proposed C-DSL game has unique Nash equilibria (NE) under both matched filter (MF) and linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) receivers.

A different approach, introduced by Kim and Park, allows to combine right preprocessing and detection in a single step by performing lattice reduction on an v{augmented channel matrix}. In this paper we propose an improvement of the augmented matrix approach which guarantees a better performance. We prove that our method attains the maximum receive diversity order of the channel. Simulation results evidence that it significantly outperforms LLL reduction followed by successive interference cancellation (SIC) while requiring a moderate increase in complexity. A theoretical bound on the complexity is also derived.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.072210.100023","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5578601/05530424.pdf","startPage":"2853","endPage":"2859","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.072210.100023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5578601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Augmented Lattice Reduction for MIMO Decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5530424","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5530424/","displayDocTitle":"Augmented Lattice Reduction for MIMO Decoding","volume":"9","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 2010","accessionNumber":"11527920","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5530424/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Augmented Lattice Reduction for MIMO Decoding","sourcePdf":"2853-tw1009-luzzi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05621S","chronDate":"September  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5578601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5578601","articleId":"5530424","onlineDate":"29 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5530460,"authors":[{"name":"Peyman Mohajerin Esfahani","affiliation":["Automatic Control Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Peyman","lastName":"Mohajerin Esfahani","id":"37085437065"},{"name":"Maria Vrakopoulou","affiliation":["Power Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Vrakopoulou","id":"37546037000"},{"name":"Kostas Margellos","affiliation":["Automatic Control Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Kostas","lastName":"Margellos","id":"37403362500"},{"name":"John Lygeros","affiliation":["Automatic Control Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Lygeros","id":"37301174800"},{"name":"G\u00f6ran Andersson","affiliation":["Power Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"G\u00f6ran","lastName":"Andersson","id":"37272976300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7427-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7426-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7425-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"5530460","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1229},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power systems","Control systems","Power system control","Power system dynamics","Automatic generation control","Frequency","SCADA systems","Power generation","Communication system control","Radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power engineering computing","power system control","power system security","reachability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-area power system","cyber attack","reachability method","VIKING research project","IT infrastructure","systematic methodology","automatic generation control loop","power exchange"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5530460","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2010.5530460","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2010.5530460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5530425","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512481/5530425/05530460.pdf","startPage":"962","endPage":"967","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cyber attack in a two-area power system: Impact identification using reachability","abstract":"This paper presents new results on the applications of reachability methods and computational tools to a twoarea power system in the case of a cyber attack.

Hybrid vehicles use two or more distinct power sources for propulsion, and their complex powertrain architecture requires the coordination of all the subsystems to achieve target performances in terms of fuel consumption, driveability, component life-time, exhaust emissions. Many control strategies have been presented and successfully applied, mainly based on heuristics or rules and tuned on certain reference drive cycles. To take into account that cycles are not exactly known a priori in driving routine, this paper proposes a stochastic approach for the power management problem. We focus on a series hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), which combines an internal combustion engine and an electric motor. The power demand from the driver is modeled as a Markov chain estimated on several driving cycles and used to generate scenarios in the SMPC law. Simulation results over a standard driving cycle are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stochastic approach and compared with other deterministic approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5530504/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11509525","publicationDate":"June 2010","conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5530504/","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A stochastic model predictive control approach for series hybrid electric vehicle power management","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A stochastic model predictive control approach for series hybrid electric vehicle power management","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"09620888.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061524S","chronDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512481","isNumber":"5530425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512481","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"5530425","articleId":"5530504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5530575,"authors":[{"name":"Chenguang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Chenguang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37404783000"},{"name":"Yanan Li","affiliation":["Social Robotics Laboratory, Interactive Digital Media Institute and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yanan","lastName":"Li","id":"37538210100"},{"name":"Shuzhi Sam Ge","affiliation":["Institute of Intelligent Systems, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China","Social Robotics Laboratory, Interactive Digital Media Institute and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Shuzhi Sam","lastName":"Ge","id":"37275647400"},{"name":"Tong Heng Lee","affiliation":["Social Robotics Laboratory, Interactive Digital Media Institute and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Tong Heng","lastName":"Lee","id":"37277268600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7427-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7426-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7425-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"5530575","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":223},"abstract":"In this paper, a novel adaptive predictive control is presented for a class of multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems in block-triangular form with uncertain couplings of states/delayed states as well as inputs among subsystems. For each subsystem of the MIMO system, future states prediction is developed and using the predicted future states, adaptive predictive control is designed under certainty equivalence principal to compensate the parametric uncertainties in the couplings. To eliminate the functional uncertainties in the couplings, a novel compensation mechanism is developed for each subsystem. Under the proposed adaptive controls, all the signals in the closed-loop MIMO systems are guaranteed to be globally bounded. In addition, all the output tracking errors are guaranteed to converge to zeros. The effectiveness of the proposed control is demonstrated in the simulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512481/5530425/05530575.pdf","startPage":"2428","endPage":"2433","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2010.5530575","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2010.5530575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5530425","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5530575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive predictive control of a class of discrete-time MIMO nonlinear systems with uncertain couplings","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Predictive control","MIMO","Nonlinear systems","Couplings","Uncertainty","Control systems","Nonlinear control systems","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","control system synthesis","discrete time systems","equivalence classes","MIMO systems","nonlinear control systems","predictive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive predictive control","discrete time systems","MIMO nonlinear systems","multiinput multioutput systems","block-triangular form","uncertain couplings","future states prediction","equivalence principal","compensation mechanism","closed-loop systems","output tracking errors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5530575/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive predictive control of a class of discrete-time MIMO nonlinear systems with uncertain couplings","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5530575/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11494549","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive predictive control of a class of discrete-time MIMO nonlinear systems with uncertain couplings","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"03990385.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104214S","chronDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512481","isNumber":"5530425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512481","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5530425","articleId":"5530575","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5530578,"authors":[{"name":"Bahman Gharesifard","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of California San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Bahman","lastName":"Gharesifard","id":"37545470700"},{"name":"Jorge Cort\u00e9s","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of California San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Cort\u00e9s","id":"37286603500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7427-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7426-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7425-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"5530578","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":391},"abstract":"Digraphs with doubly stochastic adjacency matrices play an essential role in a variety of cooperative control problems including distributed averaging, optimization, and gossiping.

The communication network of these control systems make them vulnerable to attacks from malicious outsiders.

Furthermore, we discuss how to reduce the number of observer nodes while maintaining the coverage of the entire network. The results are applied to two classes of networked control systems: a network running the consensus protocol and a power network defined by the linearized swing equation. Sufficient conditions for the existence of the proposed attack detection scheme are provided for the first class of systems. For the second class, we provide a necessary condition for the existence of the proposed detection scheme.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Networked control systems","Control systems","Communication system control","Communication networks","SCADA systems","Equations","Computer networks","Protocols","Sufficient conditions","Power system protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","observers","protocols","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["networked control system","cyber attacks","power network","communication network","distributed scheme","observers","consensus protocol","linearized swing equation","attack detection scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Networked Control Systems","Fault Detection","Power Systems"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5530425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2010.5530638","startPage":"3690","endPage":"3696","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512481/5530425/05530638.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2010.5530638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Networked control systems under cyber attacks with applications to power networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Networked control systems under cyber attacks with applications to power networks","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11508799","publicationDate":"June 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5530638/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5530638/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Networked control systems under cyber attacks with applications to power networks","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"06070844.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117902S","chronDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512481","isNumber":"5530425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512481","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"5530425","articleId":"5530638","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-12-21"},{"_id":5530648,"authors":[{"name":"Vahram Stepanyan","affiliation":["NASA Ames Research Center, Mission Critical Technologies, Inc., Moffett Field, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Vahram","lastName":"Stepanyan","id":"37427538600"},{"name":"Kalmanje Krishnakumar","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems Division, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kalmanje","lastName":"Krishnakumar","id":"38308695500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7427-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7426-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7425-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"5530648","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":397},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive control","Feedback","Control systems","Error correction","Signal generators","Frequency","Guidelines","Programmable control","Low pass filters","NASA"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","model reference adaptive control systems","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MRAC architecture","model reference adaptive control architecture","guaranteed transient performance","uncertain system","error feedback gain","ideal control signal","high frequency oscillations"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents modification of the conventional model reference adaptive control (MRAC) architecture in order to achieve guaranteed transient performance both in the output and input signals of an uncertain system.

Since buildings account for about 40% of global final energy use, energy efficient building climate control can have an important contribution. In this paper we develop and analyze a Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) strategy for building climate control that takes into account weather predictions to increase energy efficiency while respecting constraints resulting from desired occupant comfort. We investigate a bilinear model under stochastic uncertainty with probabilistic, time varying constraints. We report on the assessment of this control strategy in a large-scale simulation study where the control performance with different building variants and under different weather conditions is studied. For selected cases the SMPC approach is analyzed in detail and shown to significantly outperform current control practice.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512481/5530425/05530680.pdf","startPage":"5100","endPage":"5105","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2010.5530680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2010.5530680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5530425","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5530680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficient building climate control using Stochastic Model Predictive Control and weather predictions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Stochastic processes","Predictive models","Predictive control","Weather forecasting","Automatic control","Uncertainty","Mathematical model","Temperature control","Actuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air conditioning","bilinear systems","building management systems","climatology","energy conservation","energy consumption","predictive control","probability","space heating","stochastic systems","ventilation","weather forecasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficient building climate control","stochastic model predictive control","weather prediction","climate change","massive energy saving","global final energy use","SMPC strategy","occupant comfort","bilinear model","stochastic uncertainty","probabilistic constraint","time varying constraint","large-scale simulation","control performance","building variant","weather condition","heating","ventilation","air conditioning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5530680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficient building climate control using Stochastic Model Predictive Control and weather predictions","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5530680/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11508951","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficient building climate control using Stochastic Model Predictive Control and weather predictions","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"08411115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080698S","chronDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512481","isNumber":"5530425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512481","citationCount":"141","xplore-issue":"5530425","articleId":"5530680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":5530715,"authors":[{"name":"Masoud Abbaszadeh","affiliation":["Department of Research and Development, Maplesoft, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Masoud","lastName":"Abbaszadeh","id":"37299255200"},{"name":"Horacio J.

The main criticism behind this approach, however, has been the restrictive nature of the Lipschitz continuity condition and the conservativeness of the related results. This work deals with an extension to this problem by introducing a more general family of nonlinear functions, namely one-sided Lipschitz functions. The corresponding class of systems is a superset of its well-known Lipschitz counterpart and possesses inherent advantages with respect to conservativeness. In this paper, first the problem of state observer design for this class of systems is established, the challenges are discussed and some analysis-oriented tools are provided. Then, a solution to the observer design problem is proposed in terms of nonlinear matrix inequalities which in turn are converted into numerically efficiently solvable linear matrix inequalities.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2010.5530715","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512481/5530425/05530715.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2010.5530715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5530425","startPage":"5284","endPage":"5289","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear observer design for one-sided Lipschitz systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5530715","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear observer design for one-sided Lipschitz systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5530715/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11509103","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5530715/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear observer design for one-sided Lipschitz systems","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"08711173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047969S","chronDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512481","isNumber":"5530425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512481","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"5530425","articleId":"5530715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5530728,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Two output feedback based MRAC schemes are developed for MIMO plants with known and unknown plant dynamics. The sensor uncertainty is modeled as parametrizable uncertain functions and a compensator is constructed to adaptively cancel the effects of sensor uncertainties, to generate an adaptive estimate of the plant output. The estimated system output is used for the feedback control law. For systems with unknown plant dynamics, a new feedback controller structure is developed, so that uncertainties of both plant and sensor measurements can be effectively compensated by adaptation. Simulation results are presented to show that the proposed MRAC scheme for unknown plant dynamics can significantly improve the tracking performance despite the sensor uncertainties.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2010.5530735","startPage":"3229","endPage":"3234","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2010.5530735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5530425","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512481/5530425/05530735.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Output feedback MIMO MRAC schemes with sensor uncertainty compensation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5530735/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Output feedback MIMO MRAC schemes with sensor uncertainty compensation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5530735/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11509173","publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Output feedback MIMO MRAC schemes with sensor uncertainty compensation","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"05311507.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059071S","chronDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512481","isNumber":"5530425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512481","xplore-issue":"5530425","articleId":"5530735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5530755,"authors":[{"name":"Sourabh Bhattacharya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Sourabh","lastName":"Bhattacharya","id":"37275362500"},{"name":"Tamer Ba\u015far","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Tamer","lastName":"Ba\u015far","id":"37269539100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7427-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7426-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7425-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"5530755","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1628},"abstract":"In this paper, we consider a differential game theoretic approach to compute optimal strategies by a team of UAVs to evade the attack of an aerial jammer on the communication channel.

Non-linear constrained and unconstrained optimization problems are formulated to estimate model parameters as well as synaptic inputs using ISIs data.

It can represent all the CPL functions and approximate any continuous nonlinear function with arbitrary precision. Moreover, the parameters of SCPLNN are directly related to the expression of the subregions, in each of which SCPLNN equals to a linear function. Based on this property, this paper proposes an identification algorithm for SCPLNN, including domain partition and parameters optimization. In numerical experiments, SCPLNN with this algorithm outperforms hinging hyperplanes which is a widely used CPL model, showing the power and flexibility of SCPLNN in approximation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5530927/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11508732","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5530927/","publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Identification algorithm for standard continuous piecewise linear neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification algorithm for standard continuous piecewise linear neural network","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"08140651.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071391S","chronDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512481","isNumber":"5530425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512481","xplore-issue":"5530425","articleId":"5530927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5530929,"authors":[{"name":"Farshad Farid","affiliation":["Whirlpool Corporation, Harbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Farshad","lastName":"Farid","id":"37282838400"},{"name":"Farzad Pourboghrat","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Southem Illinois University, Carbondale, Carbondale, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Farzad","lastName":"Pourboghrat","id":"37282838800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7427-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7426-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7425-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"5530929","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5530929","abstract":"This paper presents an online modeling and control strategy for a class of linearizable nonlinear systems with unknown parameters and nonlinearities.

The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations are derived with respect to each cumulant minimization case. Then a neural network approximation method is used to numerically solve the HJB equations, which in turn is used to find the optimal controller.

This study presents an integrated framework that achieves both maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control and diagnosis of change in internal resistance simultaneously. An extremum seeking control (ESC) strategy is developed to maximize the power output of the PV array by regulating the voltage input to the DC-DC converter. Simulation results show that the ESC can achieve MPPT with periodic dither signals such as sinusoidal or square-wave signals. The degraded PV cells often demonstrate certain change of internal resistance, i.e. increase in the series resistance and decrease in the shunt resistance. The change of these internal resistances can induce the change of transient behavior of the dithered output remarkably for square wave dithering, which is validated with simulation study. The ESC with square-wave dithering can thus provides the dual benefits of MPPT and degradation detection simultaneously. Furthermore, simulation study on the PV modules under partial shading, though the P-V characteristic has changed, the proposed option is to pick the optimal regions to narrow down the ESC searching intervals and thus can locate the global maximum power point faster.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512481/5530425/05531046.pdf","startPage":"3536","endPage":"3541","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2010.5531046","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2010.5531046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5530425","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5531046","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extremum seeking control based integration of MPPT and degradation detection for photovoltaic arrays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","Photovoltaic systems","Solar power generation","Table lookup","Control systems","Voltage control","Mechanical engineering","Costs","DC-DC power converters","Wind energy generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","maximum power point trackers","optimal control","photovoltaic cells","power generation control","square-wave generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extremum seeking control","MPPT","degradation detection","photovoltaic array","power generation","fault diagnosis","maximum power point tracking control","DC-DC converter","sinusoidal signal","square-wave signal","PV cells","series resistance","shunt resistance","square-wave dithering","partial shading"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5531046/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Extremum seeking control based integration of MPPT and degradation detection for photovoltaic arrays","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5531046/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11509186","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extremum seeking control based integration of MPPT and degradation detection for photovoltaic arrays","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"05811844.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074275S","chronDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512481","isNumber":"5530425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512481","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5530425","articleId":"5531046","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5531089,"authors":[{"name":"Alina Eqtami","affiliation":["Control Systems Laboratory, Department of Mechanical Engineering, National and Technical University of Athens, Zografou, Greece"],"firstName":"Alina","lastName":"Eqtami","id":"38557273400"},{"name":"Dimos V.

Similarly to the continuous-time case, the plant is assumed input-to-state stable with respect to measurement errors and the control law is updated once a triggering condition involving the norm of a measurement error is violated. The results are also extended to a self-triggered formulation, where the next control updates are decided at the previous ones, thus relaxing the need for continuous monitoring of the measurement error. The overall framework is then used in a novel Model Predictive Control approach. The results are illustrated through simulated examples.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2010.5531089","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512481/5530425/05531089.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2010.5531089","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5530425","startPage":"4719","endPage":"4724","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Event-triggered control for discrete-time systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5531089","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Event-triggered control for discrete-time systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5531089/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11509339","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5531089/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event-triggered control for discrete-time systems","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"07781383.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058033S","chronDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512481","isNumber":"5530425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512481","citationCount":"125","xplore-issue":"5530425","articleId":"5531089","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5531095,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Richter","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Richter","id":"37387843700"},{"name":"S\u00e9bastien Mari\u00e9thoz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"S\u00e9bastien","lastName":"Mari\u00e9thoz","id":"37267919600"},{"name":"Manfred Morari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Manfred","lastName":"Morari","id":"37282929500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7427-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7426-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7425-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"5531095","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1107},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5531095","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gradient methods","Computational complexity","Optimization methods","Time factors","Context modeling","Predictive models","Predictive control","Computer industry","Digital signal processors","Digital arithmetic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","constraint theory","gradient methods","optimisation","power convertors","power system control","predictive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high speed online MPC","fast gradient method","power converter control","computational complexity","online optimization method","hard time constraints","model predictive control","pre-conditioning technique","industrial-type digital signal processor","integer arithmetics"]}],"abstract":"Bounding the computational complexity of an online optimization method in a real-time environment with hard time constraints is a challenging problem. This paper investigates a new solution approach based on a fast gradient method in the context of model predictive control (MPC) of power converters. Different from other solution methods that either provide bounds that are far off from the practically observed ones or do not allow for bounding the computational effort at all this method enables easy to compute and meaningful bounds that can further be decreased by means of a pre-conditioning technique.We report an implementation of the fast gradient method on an industrial-type digital signal processor with integer arithmetics and show that worst case runtimes are in the order of tens of \u03bcs using less than one kByte of memory while being numerically robust. Moreover, this method also improves the control performance compared to explicit MPC.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512481/5530425/05531095.pdf","startPage":"4737","endPage":"4743","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2010.5531095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2010.5531095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5530425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-speed online MPC based on a fast gradient method applied to power converter control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5531095/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"High-speed online MPC based on a fast gradient method applied to power converter control","htmlLink":"/document/5531095/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11509346","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-speed online MPC based on a fast gradient method applied to power converter control","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"07811221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050902S","chronDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512481","isNumber":"5530425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512481","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5530425","articleId":"5531095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5531148,"authors":[{"name":"Megumi Matsutani","affiliation":["Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Megumi","lastName":"Matsutani","id":"37546831900"},{"name":"Anuradha M.

The system identification is achieved through grammatical inference techniques, and the deviation of the plant output from the nominal estimated language gives a metric for fault detection. The algorithm is validated on a numerical simulation test-bed that is built upon the NASA C-MAPSS model of a generic commercial aircraft engine.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512481/5530425/05531246.pdf","startPage":"5954","endPage":"5959","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2010.5531246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2010.5531246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5530425","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5531246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symbolic identification for anomaly detection in aircraft gas turbine engines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aircraft propulsion","Turbines","Engines","Fault detection","Robustness","Pattern recognition","State-space methods","System identification","Inference algorithms","Numerical simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace engines","aircraft","fault diagnosis","gas turbines","maintenance engineering","numerical analysis","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symbolic identification","anomaly detection","aircraft gas turbine engines","fault detection","general dynamical system structure","statistical pattern recognition","numerical simulation","generic commercial aircraft engine"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly Detection","Symbolic Dynamics","System Identification","Fixed Structure Automata","CMAPSS"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5531246/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Symbolic identification for anomaly detection in aircraft gas turbine engines","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5531246/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11508831","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbolic identification for anomaly detection in aircraft gas turbine engines","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"09800631.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.357577S","chronDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512481","isNumber":"5530425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512481","xplore-issue":"5530425","articleId":"5531246","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5531336,"authors":[{"name":"Mingfeng Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Aerospace Studies, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Mingfeng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37539176600"},{"name":"Hugh H.T.

An event-triggered approach is used to trigger the transmission of information from the sensor to the remote-observer. The event-trigger is chosen to minimize the mean square estimation error at the remote-observer subject to a constraint on how frequently the information can be transmitted. This problem was studied by O.C. Imer et al. [1] and M. Rabi et al. [2] where the observed process was a scalar linear system over a finite time interval. This paper extends those earlier results by relaxing the prior assumption that the initial condition is zero-mean with no measurement noise. It extends those earlier results to vector linear systems through a computationally efficient way of computing sub-optimal event-triggering thresholds.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512481/5530425/05531338.pdf","startPage":"2138","endPage":"2143","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2010.5531338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2010.5531338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5530425","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5531338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Event-triggered state estimation in vector linear processes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["State estimation","Vectors","Wireless sensor networks","Bandwidth","Estimation error","Stability","Communication system control","Linear systems","Noise measurement","Networked control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mean square error methods","observers","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["event-triggered state estimation","vector linear process","distributed estimation problem","remote observer","information transmission","mean square estimation error","scalar linear system","finite time interval","wireless sensor networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5531338/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Event-triggered state estimation in vector linear processes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5531338/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11509200","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event-triggered state estimation in vector linear processes","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"03530938.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056386S","chronDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512481","isNumber":"5530425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512481","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5530425","articleId":"5531338","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5531407,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The solution is based on a multi-model scheme consisting of a set of tentative delay estimations along with a switching mechanism aimed at progressively updating them through time according to a figure of merit. Moreover, the set of tentative delays is proved to converge to the actual delays under certain persistent excitation conditions on the input signals. Another contribution of the paper stems from the fact that the presented method can be regarded as an online implementation of an heuristic optimization method known as Pattern Search, very uncommon in control systems applications. Also, numerical examples showing the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are included.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2010.5531407","startPage":"6561","endPage":"6566","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2010.5531407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5530425","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512481/5530425/05531407.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multimodel-based techniques for the identification of the delay in MIMO systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5531407/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multimodel-based techniques for the identification of the delay in MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5531407/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11509440","publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multimodel-based techniques for the identification of the delay in MIMO systems","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"10791200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06599S","chronDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512481","isNumber":"5530425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512481","xplore-issue":"5530425","articleId":"5531407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5531422,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Esbrook","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Esbrook","id":"37546947000"},{"name":"Matt Guibord","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Matt","lastName":"Guibord","id":"37546951800"},{"name":"Xiaobo Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaobo","lastName":"Tan","id":"37420481400"},{"name":"Hassan K.

A servocompensator is proposed, in combination with an approximate hysteresis inverse, to achieve high-precision tracking. The servocompensator accommodates the internal model of the reference signal and a finite number of harmonic terms. It is shown that, with a Prandtl-Ishlinskii (PI) hysteresis operator, the closed-loop system admits a unique, asymptotically stable, periodic solution, which justifies treating the inversion error as an exogenous periodic disturbance. Consequently, the asymptotic tracking error can be made arbitrarily small when the servocompensator accommodates a sufficient number of harmonic terms. Robustness with respect to uncertainties in the dynamics is also established. Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the approach and evaluate the role of hysteresis inversion. In particular, experiments on a nanopositioner show that, with the proposed method, tracking can be achieved for a 200 Hz reference signal with 0.6% mean error and 2.3% peak error for a travel range of 20 \u03bcm.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Hysteresis","Nanopositioning","Uncertainty","Adaptive control","Scanning probe microscopy","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Robust control","Sliding mode control","Materials science and technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atomic force microscopy","compensation","hysteresis","nanopositioning","physical instrumentation control","servomechanisms","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["servocompensation","nanopositioning","AFM systems","SPM systems","linear dynamics","uncertainties","high precision tracking","Prandtl Ishlinskii hysteresis operator"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5530425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2010.5531422","startPage":"6531","endPage":"6536","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512481/5530425/05531422.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2010.5531422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of systems with hysteresis via servocompensation and its application to nanopositioning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Control of systems with hysteresis via servocompensation and its application to nanopositioning","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11509514","publicationDate":"June 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5531422/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5531422/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of systems with hysteresis via servocompensation and its application to nanopositioning","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"10741388.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055922S","chronDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512481","isNumber":"5530425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512481","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5530425","articleId":"5531422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5531423,"authors":[{"name":"Guy Gauthier","affiliation":["Ecole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Guy","lastName":"Gauthier","id":"37426499100"},{"name":"Benoit Boulet","affiliation":["McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Benoit","lastName":"Boulet","id":"37328054700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7427-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7426-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7425-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"5531423","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Algorithm design and analysis","Genetic algorithms","Temperature sensors","Automatic control","Robustness","Thermoforming","Temperature control","Plastics","Electrical equipment industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","control system analysis","genetic algorithms","heating","iterative methods","learning systems","thermoforming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust design","terminal ILC","internal model control","\u03bc-analysis","genetic algorithm","thermoforming heater temperature setpoints","cycle-to-cycle control","terminal iterative learning control","thermoforming ovens","temperature sensors","heaters","IMC exponential filter","robust closed-loop system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5531423","abstract":"The thermoforming heater temperature setpoints can be automatically tuned with cycle-to-cycle control.

The SOLA-based adaptive approach is designed to learn the infinite horizon continuous-time Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation and its corresponding optimal control input. A novel parameter tuning algorithm is derived which not only ensures the optimal cost (HJB) function and control input are achieved, but also ensures the system states remain bounded during the online learning process. Lyapunov techniques show that all signals are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) and the approximated control signal approaches the optimal control input with small bounded error. In the absence of OLA reconstruction errors, asymptotic convergence to the optimal control is shown. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2010.5531586","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512481/5530425/05531586.pdf","startPage":"1568","endPage":"1573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2010.5531586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5530425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal control of affine nonlinear continuous-time systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5531586","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5531586/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal control of affine nonlinear continuous-time systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11508928","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5531586/","conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal control of affine nonlinear continuous-time systems","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"02580320.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057268S","chronDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512481","isNumber":"5530425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512481","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5530425","articleId":"5531586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5531594,"authors":[{"name":"Karthik Mohan","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Washington, Seattle, USA"],"firstName":"Karthik","lastName":"Mohan","id":"37546645400"},{"name":"Maryam Fazel","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Washington, Seattle, USA"],"firstName":"Maryam","lastName":"Fazel","id":"37269389600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7427-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7426-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7425-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"5531594","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":54,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":738},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System identification","Control systems","Machine learning","Iterative algorithms","Heuristic algorithms","Sparse matrices","Convergence","Machine learning algorithms","Compressed sensing","Collaboration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","convergence","gradient methods","identification","matrix algebra","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reweighted nuclear norm minimization","matrix rank minimization problem","convex constraints","NP-hard problem","reweighted trace minimization","convergence","low-order system identification","input-output data"]}],"abstract":"The matrix rank minimization problem consists of finding a matrix of minimum rank that satisfies given convex constraints. It is NP-hard in general and has applications in control, system identification, and machine learning. Reweighted trace minimization has been considered as an iterative heuristic for this problem. In this paper, we analyze the convergence of this iterative heuristic, showing that the difference between successive iterates tends to zero. Then, after reformulating the heuristic as reweighted nuclear norm minimization, we propose an efficient gradient-based implementation that takes advantage of the new formulation and opens the way to solving large-scale problems. We apply this algorithm to the problem of low-order system identification from input-output data. Numerical examples demonstrate that the reweighted nuclear norm minimization makes model order selection easier and results in lower order models compared to nuclear norm minimization without weights.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2010.5531594","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512481/5530425/05531594.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5530425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2010.5531594","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference","startPage":"2953","endPage":"2959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reweighted nuclear norm minimization with application to system identification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5531594","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Reweighted nuclear norm minimization with application to system identification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5531594/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5531594/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11508994","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reweighted nuclear norm minimization with application to system identification","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"04861624.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052984S","chronDate":"June 30 2010-July 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512481","isNumber":"5530425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512481","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5530425","articleId":"5531594","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5531731,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9235"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9340"}],"articleNumber":"5531731","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":33},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"People","doi":"10.1109/MSPEC.1965.5531731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5531692","endPage":"152","publicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6/5531692/05531731.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSPEC.1965.5531731","startPage":"150","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5531731","abstract":"Provides news relating to engineering and computing industry leaders, practitioners and researchers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5531731/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1965","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1965","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"2","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1965","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"People","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"People","sourcePdf":"SPEC-v2-n7-39.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021769S","chronDate":"July  1965","isNumber":"5531692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6","citationCount":"3","articleId":"5531731","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5531769,"authors":[{"name":"Nilo Lindgren","affiliation":["Staff Writer"],"firstName":"Nilo","lastName":"Lindgren","id":"37427851500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9235"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9340"}],"articleNumber":"5531769","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Humans","Natural languages","Automatic speech recognition","Automata","Handwriting recognition","Pattern recognition","Acoustical engineering","Vocoders","Stress"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6/5531748/05531769.pdf","startPage":"114","endPage":"136","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Machine recognition of human language Part I -

Compared with radio frequency communication, free space optical communication has many advantages. It can provide very high speed communication services. But it is deeply influenced by the atmosphere turbulence, when used in terrestrial application. It is very important to do some researches on the atmosphere turbulence and its effects on the free space optical communication. We have used an experimental free space optical communication system to measure the characterization of atmosphere turbulence. In this paper we mainly analyze the experiment data of atmosphere turbulence. We also review the theory of atmosphere turbulence and analyze the relation with the characterization of atmosphere turbulence and the receiving power of the free space optical system. From the data we found that the atmosphere turbulence changed with time and weather. And we get some results from analyze the experiment data. The results from the experiment are very important in the design optimization of free space optics system performance in actual operational environments.","publicationTitle":"8th Asia-Pacific Symposium on Information and Telecommunication Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"8th Asia-Pacific Symposium on Information and Telecommunication Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521347/5532009/05532052.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5532009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Studies on C<sup>2</sup>n and its effects on free space optical communication system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5532052","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5532052/","displayDocTitle":"Studies on C<sup>2</sup>n and its effects on free space optical communication system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11447737","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5532052/","conferenceDate":"15-18 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Studies on C<sup>2</sup>n and its effects on free space optical communication system","confLoc":"Kuching, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1569262739.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093572S","chronDate":"15-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521347","isNumber":"5532009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521347","xplore-issue":"5532009","articleId":"5532052","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5532065,"authors":[{"name":"Tu A.

Therefore, most people have chosen the home security system as the most reliable way to protect their home. However, the existing security mechanism provided by smart home is lack of intelligence for higher level decision making and action taking. Furthermore, the current security management of smart home is usually predefined by user. Thus, for consequences that are out of the defined scopes, chances to trigger false alarm are very high. Besides, the environment of each smart home is difference and the culture is also different from country to country, so the predefined security instructions may not work well or they may not suitable for all scenarios. Therefore, an intelligent algorithm with self learning ability must be adopted for smart home system in order to take adequate actions against the evaluated environment and decide for the necessary actions. Neural networks have been proposed in this paper where they are adaptive statistical models based on an analogy with the structure of the brain. The intelligence of the smart home should be able to analyze the information gathered by the sensors and detectors and to respond based on the analysis and the experiences gained via the neural networks. Neural network is chosen because they have the learning ability to estimate the parameters of some populations using a small number of examples at a time. When come to neural network learning process, there are several learning algorithms that could be applied, which can learn through pattern recognition, movement recognition, action recognition and so forth.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521347/5532009/05532066.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"8th Asia-Pacific Symposium on Information and Telecommunication Technologies","publicationTitle":"8th Asia-Pacific Symposium on Information and Telecommunication Technologies","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5532009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network approach towards reinforcing smart home security","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5532066/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"A neural network approach towards reinforcing smart home security","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11447746","publicationDate":"June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5532066/","conferenceDate":"15-18 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network approach towards reinforcing smart home security","confLoc":"Kuching","sourcePdf":"1569263211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042211S","chronDate":"15-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521347","isNumber":"5532009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521347","xplore-issue":"5532009","articleId":"5532066","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE Institute of Electronics Informati","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5532070,"authors":[{"name":"Kriangkrai Limthong","affiliation":["The Graduate University for Advanced Studies (Sokendai), Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kriangkrai","lastName":"Limthong","id":"37540381700"},{"name":"Pirawat Watanapongse","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Graduate School, Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Pirawat","lastName":"Watanapongse","id":"37540425500"},{"name":"Fukuda Kensuke","affiliation":["National Institute of Informatics / PRESTO JST, Tokyo 101-8430 Japan"],"firstName":"Fukuda","lastName":"Kensuke","id":"37662352300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-244-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6413-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-244-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5532070","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":266},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Computer crime","IP networks","Computer networks","Wavelet analysis","Computer viruses","Informatics","Computerized monitoring","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security of data","telecommunication security","telecommunication traffic","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet-based anomaly detection","outbound network traffic","inbound traffic","outbound traffic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wavelet","statistical distance","anomaly detection","time series","outbound","network traffic"]}],"abstract":"Monitoring and detecting network anomalies are indispensable activities for network administrators. Most anomaly detection techniques focus on inbound traffic (traffic from the Internet entering a customer network) rather than outbound traffic. However, anomalous inbound traffic patterns will be significantly different from anomalous outbound traffic. For network operators, outbound traffic is as important as inbound traffic because they can monitor unwanted activities in their networks to prevent it from affecting other networks. In this paper, we propose a statistic-based anomaly detection method for outbound traffic. Our method involves wavelet-based analysis and a statistical distance calculation of 3 month-long traces on outbound traffic from the computer center in Kasetsart University, which had about 1,300 users per day. We added six types of synthetic incidents to four original protocol-based time series (TCP SYN, TCP SYN/ACK, ICMP, and UDP) and investigated ability of our method to detect these anomalies. Our technique could discover short duration malicious behavior in a moderate volume of packets as well as long duration anomalous behavior in a small volume of packets. The experimental results include the detection accuracy and the false positive rates of several wavelet components, and they indicate that our technique is useful for detecting malicious and anomalous behavior in outbound traffic at a network edge.","publicationTitle":"8th Asia-Pacific Symposium on Information and Telecommunication Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"8th Asia-Pacific Symposium on Information and Telecommunication Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521347/5532009/05532070.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5532009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wavelet-based anomaly detection for outbound network traffic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5532070","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5532070/","displayDocTitle":"A wavelet-based anomaly detection for outbound network traffic","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11447750","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5532070/","conferenceDate":"15-18 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wavelet-based anomaly detection for outbound network traffic","confLoc":"Kuching, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1569263235.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065966S","chronDate":"15-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521347","isNumber":"5532009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521347","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5532009","articleId":"5532070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE Institute of Electronics Informati","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5532078,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Hsin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Cheng-Hsin Chen","id":"37539294600"},{"name":"Jyi-Tsong Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jyi-Tsong Lin","id":"37349898000"},{"name":"Yi-Chuen Eng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yi-Chuen Eng","id":"37540406400"},{"name":"Hsien-Nan Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hsien-Nan Chiu","id":"37309414100"},{"name":"Tzu-Feng Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tzu-Feng Chang","id":"37292028600"},{"name":"Yi-Hsuan Fan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yi-Hsuan Fan","id":"37539939300"},{"name":"Yu-Che Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yu-Che Chang","id":"37537830800"},{"name":"Kuan-Yu Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kuan-Yu Lu","id":"37535454300"},{"name":"Chih-Hsuan Tai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chih-Hsuan Tai","id":"37528451300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5598-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5596-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5597-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1550"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-1542"},{"format":"CD","value":"1946-1542"}],"articleNumber":"5532078","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal characteristics of an advanced bMPI-based 1T-DRAM cell","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5532078","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature","Random access memory","MOSFET circuits","Lattices","Etching","Thermal stability","Capacitance","Capacitors","Manufacturing processes","Thermal engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","failure analysis","thermal insulation","thermal stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal characteristics","advanced bMPI-based 1T-DRAM cell","bPDSOI-FET","thermal stability","short-channel characteristics","block oxide structure","middle partial insulation","S/D-tied scheme"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study the thermal characteristics of the bMPI-based 1T-DRAM cell.

The mapping capability of artificial neural networks is dependent on their structure, i.e., the number of layers and the number of hidden units. Presently, there is no formal way of computing network topology as a function of the complexity of a problem; it is usually selected by trial-and-error and can be rather time consuming. Basically, we make use of two mechanisms that may modify the topology of the network: growth and pruning. This paper firstly discusses some learning algorithms and topologies of classical constructive neural networks.

Zombie detection is currently performed at the host and/or network levels, but these options have important drawbacks: antivirus, firewalls and anti-spyware are not effective against this threat because they are not able to detect hosts that are compromised via new or target specific malicious software and were not designed to protect the network from external attacks or vulnerabilities that are already present inside the local area network. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new botnet detection approach based on the identification of traffic patterns: since each network application, whether it is licit or illicit, has a characteristic traffic pattern that can uniquely identify it, the detection framework will rely on an Artificial Neural Network to identify the licit and illicit patterns. After the identification phase, the system will generate alarms to the system administrator, that can trigger the most appropriate security actions, like blocking the corresponding IP addresses, putting them under a deeper surveillance or acting over some suspicious network segment. A general detection framework was developed in order to incorporate the detection methodology itself, as well as the data collection and storage modules and all the necessary management functions. Some performance tests were already carried out on the proposed system and the results obtained show that the system is stable and fast and the detection approach is efficient, since it provides high detection rates with low computational overhead.","doi":"10.1109/ICDT.2010.19","pdfPath":"/iel5/5532080/5532357/05532380.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"62","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Fifth International Conference on Digital Telecommunications","publicationTitle":"2010 Fifth International Conference on Digital Telecommunications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDT.2010.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5532357","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Botnet Detection System Based on Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5532380/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-19 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Botnet Detection System Based on Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11454495","publicationDate":"June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5532380/","conferenceDate":"13-19 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Botnet Detection System Based on Neural Networks","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"4071a057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043492S","chronDate":"13-19 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5532080","isNumber":"5532357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5532080","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5532357","articleId":"5532380","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5532410,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolas A.

Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) in particular have been shown to be very efficient in solving high dimensional problems. Even though several RRT variants have been proposed to tackle the dynamic replanning problem, these methods only perform well in environments with infrequent changes. This paper addresses the dynamic path planning problem by combining simple techniques in a multi-stage probabilistic algorithm. This algorithm uses RRTs as an initial solution, informed local search to fix unfeasible paths and a simple greedy optimizer. The algorithm is capable of recognizing when the local search is stuck, and subsequently restart the RRT. We show that this combination of simple techniques provides better responses to a highly dynamic environment than the dynamic RRT variants.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Path planning","Orbital robotics","Robots","Costs","Computer science","Artificial intelligence","Motion planning","Navigation","Computational efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","path planning","probability","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probabilistic sampling technique","simple heuristics","dynamic path planning problem","single shot path planning problems","rapidly exploring random trees"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["artificial intelligence","motion planning","RRT","Multi-stage","local search","greedy heuristics","probabilistic sampling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SCCC.2009.11","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference of the Chilean Computer Science Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference of the Chilean Computer Science Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/5531910/5532342/05532410.pdf","startPage":"43","endPage":"50","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5532342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCCC.2009.11","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining a Probabilistic Sampling Technique and Simple Heuristics to Solve the Dynamic Path Planning Problem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5532410","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Combining a Probabilistic Sampling Technique and Simple Heuristics to Solve the Dynamic Path Planning Problem","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5532410/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5532410/","accessionNumber":"11454458","conferenceDate":"10-12 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Nov. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining a Probabilistic Sampling Technique and Simple Heuristics to Solve the Dynamic Path Planning Problem","confLoc":"Santiago, Chile","sourcePdf":"4137a043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056953S","chronDate":"10-12 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5531910","isNumber":"5532342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5531910","xplore-issue":"5532342","articleId":"5532410","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":5532421,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Marques Ciarelli","affiliation":["Departmento de Engenharia El\u00e9trica, Universidade Federal do Esp\u00edrito Santo UFES, Vitoria, Espirito Santo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Patrick Marques","lastName":"Ciarelli","id":"37540910000"},{"name":"Elias Oliveira","affiliation":["Departamento de Ci\u00eancia da Informa\u00e7\u00e3o, Universidade Federal do Esp\u00edrito Santo UFES, Vitoria, Espirito Santo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Elias","lastName":"Oliveira","id":"37547750400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6009-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6008-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3945-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5532421","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":25},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5532421","abstract":"In this article is proposed a technique which uses centroids together with Probabilistic Neural Network to minimize some disadvantages of this net, such as the storage space for the neural network weights and linear time complexity order with the number of training samples.

The problem becomes even more difficult when multiple optimization criteria are involved, and when the target resources are heterogeneous (processors and communication links) and subject to failures. This paper investigates the problem of mapping pipelined applications, consisting of a linear chain of stages executed in a pipeline way, onto such platforms. The objective is to optimize the reliability under a performance constraint, i.e., while guaranteeing a threshold throughput. In order to increase reliability, we replicate the execution of stages on multiple processors. We present complexity results, proving that this bi-criteria optimization problem is NP-hard. We then propose some heuristics, and discuss extensive experiments evaluating their performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5532475/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5532475/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11454423","conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing the Reliability of Pipelined Applications under Throughput Constraints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing the Reliability of Pipelined Applications under Throughput Constraints","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"4120a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091563S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5531909","isNumber":"5532456","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5531909","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5532456","articleId":"5532475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5532494,"authors":[{"name":"Byung-Hyun Moon","affiliation":["College of Information & Communication Engineering, Daegu University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byung-Hyun","lastName":"Moon","id":"37528472700"},{"name":"Jeong-Tak Ryu","affiliation":["College of Information & Communication Engineering, Daegu University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jeong-Tak","lastName":"Ryu","id":"37533926900"},{"name":"Young-Suk Choi","affiliation":["College of Information & Communication Engineering, Daegu University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Suk","lastName":"Choi","id":"37535704200"},{"name":"Sung-Rak Kim","affiliation":["College of Information & Communication Engineering, Daegu University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-Rak","lastName":"Kim","id":"37537386700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6596-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6595-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5532494","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":31},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Embedded system","Keyboards","Mobile handsets","Natural languages","Muscles","Machine vision","Man machine systems","Moon","Educational institutions","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","mobile handsets","natural language processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Korean character inputting embedded system","electronic system","information representation","mobile phone","Korean language input system","inputting system typing sequence","Korean consonant","Korean vowel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Korean Character","Inputting","Embedded System"]}],"abstract":"Recently, electronic systems with various character input systems for information representation and delivery.

In recent years, cognitive radio technology has gained attention as an attractive approach to alleviate the congestion within the frequency spectrum. A cognitive radio transceiver can operate over a wide range of frequencies possibly spanning multiple frequency bands. A cognitive radio node can scan the frequency spectrum and dynamically identify frequencies that it can use for communication without interference from other wireless devices in its vicinity. When multiple cognitive radio nodes come together to form an ad hoc network, due to spatial variations in frequency usage and hardware variations in radio transceivers, different nodes in the network may perceive different subsets of frequencies available to them for communication. This heterogeneity in the available channel sets across the network increases the complexity of conducting neighbor discovery in a cognitive radio network. In this paper, we propose a new deterministic neighbor discovery algorithm for heterogeneous multi-hop cognitive radio networks with termination detection capability. Our algorithm allows nodes to detect termination of the neighbor discovery process. Our simulation results indicate that our algorithm is much faster compared to a recently proposed deterministic neighbor discovery algorithm (a reduction of 97-98% in time complexity ) and termination detection is lightweight (at most 3% of the total time complexity).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5532512/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11454442","publicationDate":"July 2010","conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5532512/","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fast Neighbor Discovery with Lightweight Termination Detection in Heterogeneous Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Neighbor Discovery with Lightweight Termination Detection in Heterogeneous Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"4120a149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058733S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5531909","isNumber":"5532456","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5531909","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5532456","articleId":"5532512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5532578,"authors":[{"name":"Chris Harrison","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Harrison","id":"37544783500"},{"name":"Jason Wiese","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Wiese","id":"37541091600"},{"name":"Anind K.

The comparison results of the virtual prototype model simulation and the experimental test also prove that the traditional Fast Fourier Transform Algorithm (FFT) analysis is not appropriate for the gear fault detection and identification. The Wavelet Back-Propagation (BP) Neural Network therefore was applied to extract the feature sets of the gear fault vibration data and classify the faults. At the first step, the wavelet analysis was employed to decompose the vibration data, and for each sample its energy of each sub-band was calculated and then treated as the input feature vector for the BP network training. By means of this approach the gear defection can be detected and recognized. The experiment test results show that the method based on wavelet BP network is available and reliable for gear fault diagnosis, and the monitoring and identification of different gear conditions, including normal, wear, and tooth broken, are accomplished with high classification accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/MVHI.2010.86","startPage":"55","endPage":"58","displayPublicationTitle":"2010

In this paper, a modified particle swarm algorithm (IMPSO) is introduced for unconstrained global optimization. The whole swarm is partitioned to three different sub-populations according to their fitness, and different velocity updating strategies are used to different sub-populations. Besides, we take advantage of crossover to maintain the diversity of the swarm and avoid getting into local optimum. IMPSO are extensively compared with other two modified PSO algorithms on three well-known benchmark functions with different dimensions. Experimental results show that IMPSO achieves not only better solutions but also faster convergence.","doi":"10.1109/MVHI.2010.113","pdfPath":"/iel5/5532084/5532465/05532678.pdf","startPage":"138","endPage":"141","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Machine Vision and Human-machine Interface","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Machine Vision and Human-machine Interface","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MVHI.2010.113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5532465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Particle Swarm Algorithms for Global Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5532678/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-25 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Particle Swarm Algorithms for Global Optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11454859","publicationDate":"April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5532678/","conferenceDate":"24-25 April 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Particle Swarm Algorithms for Global Optimization","confLoc":"Kaifeng, China","sourcePdf":"4009a138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086299S","chronDate":"24-25 April 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5532084","isNumber":"5532465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5532084","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5532465","articleId":"5532678","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5532690,"authors":[{"name":"Jiahua Xie","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information, Shanghai Second Polytechnic University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jiahua","lastName":"Xie","id":"37405093800"},{"name":"Jie Yang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information, Shanghai Second Polytechnic University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292632000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6596-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6595-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5532690","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5532690","abstract":"This paper presents a novel particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to enhance the performance of PSO.

The contribution of this paper lies in presenting a parallel implementation of MST on multi-core Cell Broadband Engine Architecture by utilizing the cell architecture potentials including DMA transfer, double buffering, mailboxes and at the same time considering the architecture limitations including memory constrains and thread synchronization. The implementation achieves up to 7 times speedup over sequential implementation.","doi":"10.1109/ACE.2010.67","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Advances in Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Advances in Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5532323/5532798/05532823.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACE.2010.67","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5532798","startPage":"281","endPage":"283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm on Cell BE","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5532823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm on Cell BE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5532823/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-21 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11455041","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5532823/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm on Cell BE","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"4058a281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044911S","chronDate":"20-21 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5532323","isNumber":"5532798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5532323","xplore-issue":"5532798","articleId":"5532823","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5532834,"authors":[{"name":"Dipak Kumar Kole","affiliation":["Department of Computer Sc. & Engineering, Saint Thomas College of Engineering and Technology, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Dipak Kumar","lastName":"Kole","id":"37540811300"},{"name":"Amiya Halder","affiliation":["Department of Computer Sc. & Engineering, Saint Thomas College of Engineering and Technology, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Amiya","lastName":"Halder","id":"37410820700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7155-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7154-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4058-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5532834","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":305},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Heuristic algorithms","Particle swarm optimization","Genetic algorithms","Clustering algorithms","Partitioning algorithms","Genetic engineering","Educational institutions","Gaussian distribution","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian distribution","genetic algorithms","image segmentation","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation algorithm","hybrid technique","particle swarm optimization","genetic algorithm","PSO","dynamic clustering approach","optimal number clusters","Gaussian distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clustering","Genetic Algorithm","PSO","Validity Index"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5532834","abstract":"This paper describe a new approach to automatic unsupervised efficient image segmentation algorithm using hybrid technique based on Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithm.

Furthermore, they cope with other issues like energy constraint and clock distribution. Energy consumption of Network-on-Chip architecture becomes one of the most vital parameter to optimize in the most of the system design. Therefore it is essential to develop energy-aware techniques for Network-on-Chip architecture. In this paper, we discuss the energy-aware Network-on-Chip architecture based on the mathematical notion of Perfect Difference Sets (PDS). In this paper, we propose the energy model for Network-on-Chip architecture using Perfect Difference Network (PDN). In this paper, we are proposing energy-aware model for PDN Circular geometry and PDN Inter-link geometry of Network-on-Chip architecture. The proposed energy model is then validated against simulation results obtained with PDN Inter-link geometry and PDN circular geometry for Network-on-Chip (NoC) architecture.

This study deals with a preliminary investigation to detect epileptic components in the electroencephalogram (EEG) waveform, which results in a reduction of analysis time by the expert neurologist. As an alternative to the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) spectral analysis approach, an Auto Regressive (AR), a Moving Average (MA) and an Auto Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) model-based spectral estimators can be used to process the EEG signal. An AR signal-processing model for the epileptic EEG is proposed. The AR modelling has been used to analyse physiological signals such as the human EEG. The interpretation of an autoregressive model as a recursive digital filter and its use in spectral estimation are considered.

Due to rainfall forecasting involves a rather complex nonlinear data pattern; there are lots of novel forecasting approaches to improve the forecasting accuracy.

First of all, we use the PPR technology to select input feature for NNs. Secondly, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm algorithm is used to train the NNs. Subsequently, example of rainfall values in August of Guangxi is used to illustrate the proposed PPR-NNs model. Empirical results indicate that the proposed method is better than the conventional neural network forecasting models which PPR-NNs model provides a promising alternative for forecasting rainfall application.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 May 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5532927/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11454583","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5532927/","publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","conferenceDate":"28-31 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Rainfall Forecasting Using Projection Pursuit Regression and Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rainfall Forecasting Using Projection Pursuit Regression and Neural Networks","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"4030b488.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03529S","chronDate":"28-31 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5532083","isNumber":"5532901","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5532083","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5532901","articleId":"5532927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5532995,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Li","affiliation":["College of Communication and Electronic Engineering, Qiqihar University, Qiqihar, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Li","id":"37539770700"},{"name":"Lifeng Wang","affiliation":["College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Lifeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37539332200"},{"name":"Jianhong Liu","affiliation":["College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Qiqihar University, Qiqihar, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Jianhong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37537661100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6813-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6812-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5532995","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Processor scheduling","Grid computing","Particle swarm optimization","Scheduling algorithm","Resource management","Educational institutions","Genetic algorithms","Computational modeling","Costs","Assembly"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","genetic algorithms","grid computing","particle swarm optimisation","scheduling","task analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational grid task scheduling","particle swarm algorithm","multitask scheduling","continuous space searching","integer space searching","inertial weight value","genetic algorithm","ant algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["particle swarm","computational grid","task scheduling","scheduling model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5532995","abstract":"The traditional scheduling theory can only get the approximate optimal solution of the problem, and most is to consider algorithms on a single task or independent multitask scheduling.

Although the simulation results showed that the proposed method was not superior to the conventional pilot-aided channel estimation method involving cubic-spline interpolation or linear interpolation with the considered pilot patterns, the proposed scheme is a novel idea and worthy of a further study.","doi":"10.1109/3CA.2010.5533358","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on Computer, Communication, Control and Automation (3CA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on Computer, Communication, Control and Automation (3CA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5504583/5533315/05533358.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3CA.2010.5533358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5533315","startPage":"466","endPage":"469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GA-based pilot-aided channel estimation without interpolation in OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5533358","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"GA-based pilot-aided channel estimation without interpolation in OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 May 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5533358/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 May 2010","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11454094","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5533358/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GA-based pilot-aided channel estimation without interpolation in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Tainan, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"466.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040351S","chronDate":"5-7 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5504583","isNumber":"5533315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5504583","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5533315","articleId":"5533358","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5533361,"authors":[{"name":"Chuen-Yih Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chienkuo Technology University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chuen-Yih","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37536091900"},{"name":"Ho-Lung Hung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chienkuo Technology University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ho-Lung","lastName":"Hung","id":"37288463600"},{"name":"Shu-Hong Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chienkuo Technology University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shu-Hong","lastName":"Lee","id":"37293439800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5568-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5565-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5567-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-7983"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-8017"}],"articleNumber":"5533361","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"abstract":"Blind adaptive step-size constant modulus algorithm (CMA) for multiuser detection over multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) systems is presented. In wireless communications system, the conventional CMA for blind multiuser detection has some disadvantages such as slow convergence speed and phase rotation. In order to overcome these shortages, a modified constant modulus algorithm was developed for blind multiuser detector. In this paper, we put forward a novel receiver, which combines CMA blind adaptive multiuser detection with Electromagnetism-like method (EM) for MC-CDMA interference suppression over multipath fading channel. To work around potentially computational intractability, the proposed scheme exploits heuristics in consideration of both global and local exploration the step size of the CMA. The computer simulation results show that compared with the various CMA developed previously, the proposed EM method obtains the most desirable bit error rate performance with low computational complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on Computer, Communication, Control and Automation (3CA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5504583/5533315/05533361.pdf","startPage":"470","endPage":"475","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on Computer, Communication, Control and Automation (3CA)","doi":"10.1109/3CA.2010.5533361","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3CA.2010.5533361","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5533315","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5533361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electromagnetism-like method based blind multiuser detection for MC-CDMA interference suppression over multipath fading channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Interference suppression","Fading","Wireless communication","Convergence","Detectors","Computer simulation","Bit error rate","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","computational electromagnetics","fading channels","interference suppression","multipath channels","multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetism-like method","blind multiuser detection","MC-CDMA interference suppression","multipath fading channel","blind adaptive step-size constant modulus algorithm","multicarrier code division multiple access system","wireless communication system","phase rotation","CMA blind adaptive multiuser detection","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5533361/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"Electromagnetism-like method based blind multiuser detection for MC-CDMA interference suppression over multipath fading channel","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5533361/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11454095","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","conferenceDate":"5-7 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electromagnetism-like method based blind multiuser detection for MC-CDMA interference suppression over multipath fading channel","confLoc":"Tainan, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"470.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057365S","chronDate":"5-7 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5504583","isNumber":"5533315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5504583","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5533315","articleId":"5533361","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5533398,"authors":[{"name":"D.

We need to employ learning algorithms that can learn independently, without the need for extensive coordination. A search for alternative methods of routing packets has resulted in reinforcement learning (RL) as a good approach to adaptive routing. RL methods are able to learn and adapt to a unknown and changing environment. Using only a simple coordination signals such as a global reward value, we show that RL methods can be used to control routing of mobile agents. RL method was used to regulate the transfer of mobile agent from the network input, through the routing nodes, towards the service processing nodes. A distributed Q-Learning framework, based on RL, embeds a learning policy at every node to adapt itself to the changing network conditions, which leads to a synchronized routing information, in order to achieve a shortest delivery and service processing time of mobile agents.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5533435/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11456227","htmlLink":"/document/5533435/","conferenceDate":"24-28 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"Reinforcement learning as adaptive network routing of mobile agents","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reinforcement learning as adaptive network routing of mobile agents","confLoc":"Opatija, Croatia","sourcePdf":"04790484.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056382S","chronDate":"24-28 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512516","isNumber":"5533310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512516","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5533310","articleId":"5533435","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"MIPRO","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5533439,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Tsai Sung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chin-Yi University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Tsai","lastName":"Sung","id":"37334929400"},{"name":"Yu-Feng Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chin-Yi University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Feng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37537574000"},{"name":"Jui-Ho Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chin-Yi University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jui-Ho","lastName":"Chen","id":"37539208000"},{"name":"Chia-Hao Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chin-Yi University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Hao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37539302900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5568-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5565-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5567-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-7983"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-8017"}],"articleNumber":"5533439","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":408},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Neural networks","Data communication","Communication cables","Stability","Wireless networks","Neurons","Mathematical model","Computer networks","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised instrumentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","sensor fusion","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WSN data fusion","neural networks training process","data transmission","mathematical model","quasineural network","low cost wireless data transmission system","anti interference capability","adaptive self-learning integrated algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BP Neural Network","Data Fusion","wireless sensing network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5533439","abstract":"Issues associated with data transmission in sensing networks via either cabling or single wireless medium are investigated, e.g. installation inconvenience, bad stability, etc. A sophisticated wireless network, wireless sensing network (WSN) possesses a large amount of nodes whereby a sensing base is formed.

All SIFT-based face recognition techniques found in literature so far rely heavily on the keypoint detector. The purpose of this detector is to locate interest points in the given image that are later used to compute the SIFT descriptors. While these descriptors are known to be among others (partially) invariant to illumination changes, the keypoint detector is not. To overcome the presented shortcoming of SIFT-based methods, a novel face recognition technique is proposed in this paper. The SIFT descriptors are computed at fixed points in the locations of the nodes on a regular grid, overlapping face image. By doing so, the need for keypoint detection on the test images is eliminated and greater robustness to illumination variations is achieved in comparison with related approaches from the literature. Experimental results, obtained on the Extended Yale face database B, demonstrate that better results are achieved with proposed technique in comparison with the remaining techniques assessed in our experiments, especially under severe illumination conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 33rd International Convention MIPRO","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512516/5533310/05533495.pdf","startPage":"691","endPage":"694","publicationTitle":"The 33rd International Convention MIPRO","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5533310","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5533495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptation of SIFT features for face recognition under varying illumination","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Lighting","Face detection","Detectors","Robustness","Object detection","Principal component analysis","Linear discriminant analysis","Grid computing","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SIFT feature","varying illumination condition","scale invariant feature transform","image scale","SIFT-based face recognition","SIFT descriptor","keypoint detector","face image","extended Yale face database"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5533495/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"Adaptation of SIFT features for face recognition under varying illumination","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5533495/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11456266","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","conferenceDate":"24-28 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptation of SIFT features for face recognition under varying illumination","confLoc":"Opatija, Croatia","sourcePdf":"06910694.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047185S","chronDate":"24-28 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512516","isNumber":"5533310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512516","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5533310","articleId":"5533495","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"MIPRO","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5533505,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Shu Chang","affiliation":["Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Far East University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Shu","lastName":"Chang","id":"37535301700"},{"name":"Teh-Lu Liao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Far East University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Teh-Lu","lastName":"Liao","id":"37304214300"},{"name":"Po-Yun Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Po-Yun","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37535291100"},{"name":"Kuo-Kuang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kuo-Kuang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37536428800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5568-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5565-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5567-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-7983"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-8017"}],"articleNumber":"5533505","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":323},"abstract":"In the recent two decades, user authentication has become a popular issue of identity management.

Watermarking has been proved to be an efficient technology in the intellectual property and copyright protection for digital media. The presented 3DM watermarking algorithm uses the clustering scheme to decompose the host 3DM, uses star topology units (STU) to reconstruct the host 3DM to find candidate vertices for watermarking, and uses discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to transform candidate vertices into frequency domain to process the watermark embedding. The experiment results show that the presented algorithm can efficiently embed watermarks into a 3DM, and the embedded watermark is robust against to rotation, translation, and uniformly scaling attacks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A watermarking scheme for 3D models using Haar discrete wavelet transform","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on Computer, Communication, Control and Automation (3CA)","doi":"10.1109/3CA.2010.5533839","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on Computer, Communication, Control and Automation (3CA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5504583/5533710/05533839.pdf","startPage":"244","endPage":"247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3CA.2010.5533839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5533710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5533839","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5533839/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"A watermarking scheme for 3D models using Haar discrete wavelet transform","conferenceDate":"5-7 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5533839/","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11460707","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A watermarking scheme for 3D models using Haar discrete wavelet transform","confLoc":"Tainan, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"244.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047449S","chronDate":"5-7 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5504583","isNumber":"5533710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5504583","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5533710","articleId":"5533839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5533851,"authors":[{"name":"Mn-Ta Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Kao Yuan University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Mn-Ta","lastName":"Lee","id":"37537974300"},{"name":"Shih-Syong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Kao Yuan University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shih-Syong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37535867200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5568-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5565-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5567-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-7983"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-8017"}],"articleNumber":"5533851","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":356},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5533851","abstract":"A novel scheme combining Sobel technology with genetic algorithm is proposed in this paper to protect image copyright. For the Sobel-based copyright protection schemes in the literatures, they use Sobel technology to detect the edge of the cover image, i.e. the copyright image. By using the kernels to calculate the edge directions of the cover image, the gradients of the cover image pixels can be measured. When the gradient is greater than some scaling factor, which is used to control the robustness of the watermark, its corresponding pixel is considered to be an edge pixel. Otherwise, it is not an edge pixel. Therefore, how to decide a proper value for scaling factor is important for Sobel-based copyright protection schemes. In this paper, the genetic algorithm is used to provide optimal value for scaling factor. Experimental results are shown to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/3CA.2010.5533851","startPage":"201","endPage":"204","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on Computer, Communication, Control and Automation (3CA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5504583/5533710/05533851.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on Computer, Communication, Control and Automation (3CA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3CA.2010.5533851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5533710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image copyright protection scheme using Sobel technology and genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Copyright protection","Genetic algorithms","Watermarking","Frequency domain analysis","Discrete Fourier transforms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Image edge detection","Automatic control","Genetic engineering","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["copyright","edge detection","genetic algorithms","image coding","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image copyright protection","Sobel technology","genetic algorithm","Sobel-based copyright protection","copyright image","image pixels","edge detection","scaling factor","watermark"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["copyright protection","genetic algorithm","Sobel technology","digital watermarking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5533851/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"Image copyright protection scheme using Sobel technology and genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5533851/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","conferenceDate":"5-7 May 2010","accessionNumber":"11460719","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image copyright protection scheme using Sobel technology and genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Tainan, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08439S","chronDate":"5-7 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5504583","isNumber":"5533710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5504583","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5533710","articleId":"5533851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5533855,"authors":[{"name":"Songchar Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Songchar","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37350304600"},{"name":"Ming-Sheng Lui","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Sheng","lastName":"Lui","id":"37529043700"},{"name":"Sin-Ruei Ho","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sin-Ruei","lastName":"Ho","id":"37536573100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5568-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5565-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5567-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-7983"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-8017"}],"articleNumber":"5533855","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Streaming media","Interleaved codes","Reflective binary codes","Error analysis","Error probability","Quadrature amplitude modulation","OFDM","Error correction codes","Automatic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interleaved codes","maximum likelihood decoding","MIMO communication","multimedia communication","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","video coding","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interleaved mapping","nonuniform M-QAM","mobile video transmission","wireless multimedia transmission","MIMO-OFDM system","maximum likelihood search","zero forcing search","QR-blast search","V-blast search","H.264 streaming","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-uniform","M-QAM","Interleaved mapping","MIMO","OFDM"]}],"abstract":"This paper mainly studies combining the nonuniform M-QAM schemes with interleaving applied to wireless multimedia transmission for MIMO-OFDM systems.

Extended Interaction Klystrons have been demonstrated at frequencies up to 218 GHz CW and 229 GHz pulsed. Modern design, fabrication, and measurement technologies show promise of extending their operation into the THz regime. This paper describes the challenges and some novel approaches to the development of EIKs operating terahertz frequencies, while simultaneously meeting demanding requirements for output power, gain, bandwidth, and efficiency.The main challenges in design include focus and transport of an emittance dominated beam, development of a broadband, high gain circuit, and the minimization of the sensitivity of design to the effects of fabrication and alignment tolerances. The main challenges in fabrication and integration include achieving required component dimensions and alignment within specified tolerances and achieving high quality surface finishes using materials with satisfactory mechanical and thermal properties.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5533941/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5533941/","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11470842","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Extended Interaction Klystrons for terahertz power amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extended Interaction Klystrons for terahertz power amplifiers","confLoc":"Norfolk, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"ICOPS2C3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064602S","chronDate":"20-24 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5513766","isNumber":"5533886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5513766","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5533886","articleId":"5533941","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5534478,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Fuxj\u00e4ger","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Center Vienna, FTW, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Fuxj\u00e4ger","id":"37296696000"},{"name":"Hans Ronald Fischer","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Center Vienna, FTW, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Hans Ronald","lastName":"Fischer","id":"38259104500"},{"name":"Ivan Gojmerac","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Center Vienna, FTW, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Gojmerac","id":"37425988700"},{"name":"Peter Reichl","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Center Vienna, FTW, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Reichl","id":"37267972100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8166-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8167-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5534478","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":791},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Convergence","Telecommunication traffic","Mobile communication","DSL","Costs","Internet","Interference","Density measurement","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","cellular radio","telecommunication traffic","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio resource allocation","urban femto-WiFi convergence","mobile broadband traffic","IEEE802.11-based wireless-LAN","wireline broadband","Internet","network-planning","licensed-band femto-cell","unlicensed WiFi technology","radio-resource sharing mechanism","frequency 2.4 GHz"]}],"abstract":"The recent tremendous growth of mobile broadband traffic demand forces mobile operators to find ways for offloading their macro-infrastructure. This can be achieved by a combination of two concepts, i.e., introducing/deploying a finer grid of base-stations (femto-cells) together with increasing the share of traffic volume that is handled by communication-links operating in unlicensed bands (e.g., IEEE802.11-based wireless-LAN). Both concepts are supported by the recent proliferation of wireline broadband (DSL/cable) which enables the cost effective backhauling of small sites using standard internet access. However, new challenges in terms of network-planning arise as these small cells are deployed randomly, their resulting spatial density in urban environments may get very high, and thus the aspect of interference-mitigation is of vital importance. The contribution of this paper is twofold: first we provide a comparison of licensed-band femto-cell versus unlicensed WiFi technologies. We try to outline characteristic differences and respective limitations in terms of efficiency of radio-resource sharing mechanisms, with a specific focus on macro-cell offloading scenarios. Second, we present the results of a measurement campaign that allows to quantify the current density of WiFi access points in the 2.4GHz WiFi band in urban environments. We subsequently use these data sets to extrapolate the coverage ratios that are achievable by aggregating low-power WiFi/femto cells. This can be used to provide novel insights into specific radio-resource management problems which a mobile operator needs to solve when moving towards smaller cells and less-controllable deployment procedures.","doi":"10.1109/NGI.2010.5534478","publicationTitle":"6th EURO-NGI Conference on Next Generation Internet","displayPublicationTitle":"6th EURO-NGI Conference on Next Generation Internet","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512517/5534454/05534478.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NGI.2010.5534478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5534454","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radio resource allocation in urban femto-WiFi convergence scenarios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5534478","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Radio resource allocation in urban femto-WiFi convergence scenarios","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5534478/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11447504","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5534478/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio resource allocation in urban femto-WiFi convergence scenarios","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"ngi201002PID1360705.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088805S","chronDate":"2-4 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512517","isNumber":"5534454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512517","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5534454","articleId":"5534478","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5534584,"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Kleinrock","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Leonard","lastName":"Kleinrock","id":"37296816800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0163-6804"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1896"}],"articleNumber":"5534584","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":20376},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5534584","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["History","Internet","Resource management","Data communication","Queueing analysis","Time sharing computer systems","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Earth","Artificial satellites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet"]}],"abstract":"In this column we trace both the early history of the science and infrastructure that emerged as the ARPANET, and the trajectory of development it set for the even broader construct that we now call the Internet.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2010.5534584","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5534574/05534584.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"36","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2010.5534584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5534574","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An early history of the internet [History of Communications]","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5534584/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2010","displayDocTitle":"An early history of the internet [History of Communications]","volume":"48","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 2010","accessionNumber":"11456532","htmlLink":"/document/5534584/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An early history of the internet [History of Communications]","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"010LYT-HISTORY-August-Kleinrock.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067368S","chronDate":"August  2010","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5534574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5534574","articleId":"5534584","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5534586,"authors":[{"name":"Kanchei Loa","affiliation":["Institute for Information Industry"],"bio":{"p":["Kanchei (ken) Loa (loa@iii.org.tw) is a research fellow with the Institute for Information Industry (III) in Taiwan.

The most efficient solution to achieve this challenging objective is to utilize wider channel bandwidth. Multicarrier is the technology to utilize wider bandwidth for parallel data transmission across multiple RF carriers, which is well agreed as one of the key technologies to satisfy ITU-R IMTAdvanced requirements. As the evolution of the IEEE 802.16 e-based WiMAX 1.0 system, IEEE 802.16 m specifies physical and MAC layers to enable multicarrier technology for the WiMAX 2.0 system. This can lead to more than 1 Gb/s peak transmission rate for low-mobility users and 100 Mb/s peak transmission rate for high-mobility users. By having the protocol structure with a common MAC entity to control transmission by multiple physical-layer connections over different RF carriers, the network operator can aggregate either contiguous or non-contiguous spectrum resources with higher deployment flexibility, user throughput, and spectrum efficiency.

The first phase was dominated by voice traffic, and the second phase, which we are currently in, is dominated by data traffic. In the third phase we predict that the traffic will be dominated by video and will require new ways to optimize the network to prevent saturation. This increase in video traffic is one of the key drivers of the evolution to new mobile broadband standards like WiMAX IEEE 802.16m and 3G LTE and LTE-Advanced, motivating the need to enhance the video service capabilities of future cellular and mobile broadband systems. Therefore, it is important to understand both the potential and limitations of these networks for delivering video content in the future, which will include not only traditional video broadcasts, but also video streaming and uploading in the uplink direction. In that vein this article provides an overview of technology options for enabling multicast and unicast video services over WiMAX and LTE networks, quantifies and compares the video capacities of these networks in realistic environments, and discusses new techniques that could be exploited in the future to further enhance the video capacity and quality of user experience.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5534574/05534589.pdf","startPage":"68","endPage":"76","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2010.5534589","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2010.5534589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5534574","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5534589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward enhanced mobile video services over WiMAX and LTE [WiMAX/LTE Update]","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["WiMAX","Unicast","Satellite broadcasting","Multimedia communication","Digital video broadcasting","TV broadcasting","Broadcast technology","Streaming media","Radio broadcasting","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","cellular radio","telecommunication traffic","video streaming","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["enhanced mobile video services","wireless networks","voice traffic","data traffic","mobile broadband standards","3G LTE","WiMAX IEEE 802.16","LTE-advanced","cellular broadband systems","video streaming","multicast video services","unicast video services","video capacity","video quality"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5534589/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Toward enhanced mobile video services over WiMAX and LTE [WiMAX/LTE Update]","volume":"48","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5534589/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2010","accessionNumber":"11456536","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward enhanced mobile video services over WiMAX and LTE [WiMAX/LTE Update]","sourcePdf":"015OYMAN LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097505S","chronDate":"August  2010","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5534574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"5534574","articleId":"5534589","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-16"},{"_id":5534590,"authors":[{"name":"Ronny Yongho Kim","affiliation":["LG Electronics, Inc., South Korea"],"bio":{"p":["Ronny Yongho Kim (ronnyyongho.kim@lge.com) received his B.

One limitation originates from mismatch of granularities between the client layer and the wavelength layer. The recently proposed spectrum-sliced elastic optical path network (SLICE) is expected to mitigate this problem by adaptively allocating spectral resources according to client traffic demands. This article discusses another limitation of the current optical networks associated with worst case design in terms of transmission performance. In order to address this problem, we present a concept of a novel adaptation scheme in SLICE called distance-adaptive spectrum resource allocation. In the presented scheme the minimum necessary spectral resource is adaptively allocated according to the end-to-end physical condition of an optical path. Modulation format and optical filter width are used as parameters to determine the necessary spectral resources to be allocated for an optical path. Evaluation of network utilization efficiency shows that distance-adaptive SLICE can save more than 45 percent of required spectrum resources for a 12-node ring network. Finally, we introduce the concept of a frequency slot to extend the current frequency grid standard, and discuss possible spectral resource designation schemes.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2010.5534599","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5534574/05534599.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2010.5534599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5534574","startPage":"138","endPage":"145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distance-adaptive spectrum resource allocation in spectrum-sliced elastic optical path network [Topics in Optical Communications]","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5534599","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distance-adaptive spectrum resource allocation in spectrum-sliced elastic optical path network [Topics in Optical Communications]","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5534599/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"48","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2010","accessionNumber":"11456544","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5534599/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distance-adaptive spectrum resource allocation in spectrum-sliced elastic optical path network [Topics in Optical Communications]","sourcePdf":"025JINNO LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054797S","chronDate":"August  2010","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5534574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"552","xplore-issue":"5534574","articleId":"5534599","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5534600,"authors":[{"name":"Shao Yufeng","affiliation":["Fudan University, China"],"bio":{"p":["Yufeng Shao [M] (shaoyufeng@fudan.edu.cn) received his B.S. and M.E. degrees from Chongqing University of Post and Communication, China, in 2000 and 2005, and his Ph.D. degree from Hunan University, China, in 2009.

These days, multiprocessor systems are utilized in parallel computing because the size of programs and information increases exponentially. Most of the time we are able to beak an enormous problem into some smaller portions and assign these smaller problems to processors. By doing this, we can gain a remarkable reduction in the execution time of programs. Prior algorithms had various limitations in their assumptions, like tasks regarded independent, task graph produced in a random manner, or the zero considered communication delay. Furthermore, enough attention has not been given the complexity of algorithms. This is of paramount importance because there must be a balance between the quality of solution and execution time of algorithm. Comparative studies with actual assumption on scheduling algorithms prefer quality of solution to execution time of algorithms. This has resulted in their being inapplicable in realistic situations. This study tries to develop a new hybrid approach which genetic algorithm and tabu search for performing task scheduling (HGTS).","doi":"10.1109/ICICIS.2010.5534676","startPage":"626","endPage":"631","displayPublicationTitle":"The 3rd International Conference on Information Sciences and Interaction Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510903/5534673/05534676.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 3rd International Conference on Information Sciences and Interaction Sciences","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICIS.2010.5534676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5534673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new hybrid approach for multiprocessor system scheduling with genetic algorithm and tabu search (HGTS)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiprocessing systems","Genetic algorithms","Scheduling algorithm","Processor scheduling","Delay","Computer science","Terminology","Biological cells","Encoding","Parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","genetic algorithms","multiprocessing systems","processor scheduling","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessor system scheduling","genetic algorithm","tabu search","task scheduling","NP complete problem","parallel computing","algorithm complexity","scheduling algorithm","execution time"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Scheduling","Genetic Algorithm","Multiprocessor","Task graphs","Hybrid Algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5534676/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"A new hybrid approach for multiprocessor system scheduling with genetic algorithm and tabu search (HGTS)","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5534676/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","conferenceDate":"23-25 June 2010","accessionNumber":"11455378","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new hybrid approach for multiprocessor system scheduling with genetic algorithm and tabu search (HGTS)","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"9781424473854P626.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055614S","chronDate":"23-25 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5510903","isNumber":"5534673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510903","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5534673","articleId":"5534676","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5534687,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Jiang","affiliation":["Information Institute of Southwest University of Science and Technology MianYang CN 621010, Mian Yang, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37532166700"},{"name":"Jinghui Ma","affiliation":["Information Institute of Southwest University of Science and Technology MianYang CN 621010, Mian Yang, China"],"firstName":"Jinghui","lastName":"Ma","id":"37539740200"},{"name":"Qiang Li","affiliation":["Information Institute of Southwest University of Science and Technology MianYang CN 621010, Mian Yang, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37536147100"},{"name":"Yanchao Yang","affiliation":["Information Institute of Southwest University of Science and Technology MianYang CN 621010, Mian Yang, China"],"firstName":"Yanchao","lastName":"Yang","id":"37069162000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7386-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7384-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5534687","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":216},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5534687","abstract":"The end effects of Hilbert-Huang transform are produced in the Empirical Mode Decomposition(EMD) and the Hilbert transform for Intrinsic Mode Functions(IMF), which have a badly effect on Hilbert-Huang transform.

DUGA can select non-dominated population by calculating individual crowding distance. Some operations, such as discrete uniform distribution, crossover, mutation, and gradual iteration, are applied to achieve population diversity and rapid convergence. The engine is embedded into the CR node to achieve the optimizations.

A radio that can sense and understand its local radio spectrum environment, to identify temporarily vacant spectrum and use it, has the potential to provide higher bandwidth services, increase spectrum efficiency and minimize the need for centralized spectrum management. In an independent study conducted by Shared Spectrum Company (SSC) in an urban environment (Ireland) found that only an average of 13% of the radio frequency spectrum is used. This represents wastage, particularly to other applications that are desirous to use the particular band of frequency. Using the improved spectral power detection method, a secondary application in a controlled environment is developed and tested using real-time data obtained via the discone antenna and routed to the computer via the GPIB. The computer program detects the hole using the improved half-wave power detection algorithm and the time taken for data acquisition is matched with the typical method of power detection. The result shows a significant increase in speed over conventional methods. A speed increase could increase bandwidth throughput and allow fuzzy networks and other algorithm to provide autonomous detection and utilization for secondary applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5534778/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11455428","htmlLink":"/document/5534778/","conferenceDate":"23-25 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Improved hole detection simulation using power spectral density for the implementation of cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved hole detection simulation using power spectral density for the implementation of cognitive radio","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"9781424473854P480.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106325S","chronDate":"23-25 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5510903","isNumber":"5534673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510903","xplore-issue":"5534673","articleId":"5534778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5534804,"authors":[{"name":"Jinming Liang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Sichuan University of Science and Engineering, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Jinming","lastName":"Liang","id":"37539535000"},{"name":"Xinhua Zhang","affiliation":["School of Science, Sichuan University of Science and Engineering, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Xinhua","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37537464800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7386-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7384-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5534804","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":41},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Delay effects","Stability","Neurons","Neurofeedback","State feedback","Sufficient conditions","Cellular neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Recurrent neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","delays","fuzzy neural nets","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Cohen-Grossberg-type neural networks","fuzzy neural networks","time-varying delays","time-varying impulses","differential inequality","M-matrix theory","exponential stability","periodic oscillatory solution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Periodic oscillatory solution","Cohen-Grossberg-type fuzzy neural networks","exponential stability","time-varying delays","impulses"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5534804","abstract":"In this paper, a class of Cohen-Grossberg-type fuzzy neural networks with time-varying delays and impulses is investigated.

It is therefore important that the best energy-wise route is found for each data transfer from a source node to the sink node. We present a new adaptive and distributed routing algorithm for finding energy optimised routes in a wireless sensor network with energy harvesting. The algorithm finds an energy efficient route from each source node to a single sink node, taking into account the current energy status of the network. By simulation, the algorithm is shown to be able to adapt to changes in harvested and stored energy. Simulations show that continuous operation is possible.","doi":"10.1109/WOWMOM.2010.5534899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5534887","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","pdfPath":"/iel5/5513765/5534887/05534899.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on \"A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks\" (WoWMoM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on \"A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks\" (WoWMoM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOWMOM.2010.5534899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DEHAR: A distributed energy harvesting aware routing algorithm for ad-hoc multi-hop wireless sensor networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Wireless sensor networks","Energy harvesting","Batteries","Availability","Energy measurement","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","energy harvesting","telecommunication power supplies","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed energy harvesting aware routing algorithm","ad hoc multihop wireless sensor networks","continuous operation","network segmentation","power loss","energy-wise route","data transfer","source node","sink node","adaptive routing algorithm","distributed routing algorithm","energy status"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"DEHAR: A distributed energy harvesting aware routing algorithm for ad-hoc multi-hop wireless sensor networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5534899/","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5534899/","accessionNumber":"11455442","publicationDate":"June 2010","conferenceDate":"14-17 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DEHAR: A distributed energy harvesting aware routing algorithm for ad-hoc multi-hop wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Montrreal, QC","sourcePdf":"1b3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102077S","chronDate":"14-17 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5513765","isNumber":"5534887","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5513765","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5534887","articleId":"5534899","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5534921,"authors":[{"name":"Gabor Fodor","affiliation":["Ericsson Research Stockholm, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Gabor","lastName":"Fodor","id":"37270461500"},{"name":"Stefano Sorrentino","affiliation":["Ericsson Research Stockholm, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Sorrentino","id":"37545888300"},{"name":"Mikael Johansson","affiliation":["Automatic Control Laboratory, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mikael","lastName":"Johansson","id":"37265388800"},{"name":"Pablo Soldati","affiliation":["Automatic Control Laboratory, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Soldati","id":"37296989100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7265-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7264-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7263-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5534921","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":190},"abstract":"Network multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) systems are built around a broadband backbone network that allows for the fast communication of channel state information (CSI) as well as user data between different base stations. Previous works have shown that multicell channel adaptive (opportunistic) power control can minimize the sum power or maximize the sum rate when the backbone is used for the exchange of CSI in network MIMO systems. In this work we investigate the gains of multicell opportunistic power control under per user fairness constraints when both CSI and user data are shared between multiple sites. We find that multicell opportunistic power control working in concert with uplink joint signal detection is an efficient means both for the capacity and the power control problems that not only minimizes sum power or maximizes overall capacity, but is also able to provide arbitrary level of fairness.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on \"A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks\" (WoWMoM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5513765/5534887/05534921.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on \"A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks\" (WoWMoM)","doi":"10.1109/WOWMOM.2010.5534921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOWMOM.2010.5534921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5534887","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5534921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the impact of uplink power control in network MIMO systems with MMSE and SIC receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Joints","MIMO","Power control","Silicon carbide"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","power control","telecommunication control","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uplink power control","network MIMO systems","MMSE receiver","SIC receiver","network multiple input multiple output systems","channel state information","multicell channel adaptive power control","multicell opportunistic power control","uplink joint signal detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5534921/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"On the impact of uplink power control in network MIMO systems with MMSE and SIC receivers","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5534921/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11455468","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","conferenceDate":"14-17 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the impact of uplink power control in network MIMO systems with MMSE and SIC receivers","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"4b1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051643S","chronDate":"14-17 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5513765","isNumber":"5534887","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5513765","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5534887","articleId":"5534921","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5534953,"authors":[{"name":"D.

In this paper we investigate how specific PHY-layer operations, designed to mitigate the effect of interference, can cause the radio-receiver circuitry to over-estimate the channel occupation status, thus unnecessarily limiting the overall spatial reuse or impeding the synchronization to incoming frames. We individuated the root of this problem in the surprising effectiveness of the overall packet detection procedure of WLAN PHY, which allows for the demodulation of strongly attenuated 802.11 frames. The transmit spectrum mask for the IEEE 802.11 standard allows limited power leakage over adjacent channels. Such a low power signal from adjacent channels nowadays can be correctly recognized by recent OFDM/CCK receive circuitry, which has an important impact on WLAN performance. A receiver may miss the reception of packets destined to it, whenever a frame capture of a transmission on a partially overlapping channel occurs. A similar effect occurs in the transmit phase. In carrier sense mode, the OFDM/CCK receiver of the WLAN device is capable of synchronizing to the preamble of low SNR signals, thus unnecessarily deferring the channel access in case of transmissions on partially overlapping channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5534963/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11455504","htmlLink":"/document/5534963/","conferenceDate":"14-17 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"On the side effects of packet detection sensitivity in IEEE 802.11 interference management","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the side effects of packet detection sensitivity in IEEE 802.11 interference management","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"sa3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046397S","chronDate":"14-17 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5513765","isNumber":"5534887","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5513765","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5534887","articleId":"5534963","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5534972,"authors":[{"name":"Mubashir Husain Rehmani","affiliation":["Universite Pierre et Marie Curie-Paris 6, France"],"firstName":"Mubashir Husain","lastName":"Rehmani","id":"37545374700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7265-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7264-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7263-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5534972","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5534972","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chromium","Receivers","Cognitive radio","Spread spectrum communication","Sensors","Broadcasting","Availability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cognitive radio","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel assortment strategy","reliable communication","multihop cognitive radio networks","channel selection","data dissemination","CRN","traffic pattern","channel occupancy","primary radio nodes","cognitive radio transmissions","reception quality"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WOWMOM.2010.5534972","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on \"A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks\" (WoWMoM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on \"A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks\" (WoWMoM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5513765/5534887/05534972.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOWMOM.2010.5534972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5534887","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel assortment strategy for reliable communication in multi-hop cognitive radio networks","abstract":"Channel selection plays a vital role in efficient and reliable data dissemination.

This research aims to develop for the first time, an efficient and accurate algorithm for the tracking and prediction of Channel State Information (CSI) at the transmitter, by characterising time variation effects of the wireless communication channel on the performance of a highly-efficient MUSA-MIMO technology particularly suited for rural communities, improving their quality of life and economic prosperity.","doi":"10.1109/WOWMOM.2010.5534978","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOWMOM.2010.5534978","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on \"A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks\" (WoWMoM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5513765/5534887/05534978.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on \"A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks\" (WoWMoM)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5534887","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel tracking algorithms for highly efficient wireless broadband communications in rural areas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Channel tracking algorithms for highly efficient wireless broadband communications in rural areas","conferenceDate":"14-17 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5534978/","accessionNumber":"11455517","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5534978/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel tracking algorithms for highly efficient wireless broadband communications in rural areas","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"phd1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02878S","chronDate":"14-17 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5513765","isNumber":"5534887","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5513765","xplore-issue":"5534887","articleId":"5534978","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5535003,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Zhang","affiliation":["Wireless Information Network Laboratory, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405805200"},{"name":"Arati Baliga","affiliation":["Wireless Information Network Laboratory, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Arati","lastName":"Baliga","id":"37529533900"},{"name":"Wade Trappe","affiliation":["Wireless Information Network Laboratory, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Wade","lastName":"Trappe","id":"37266719100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7265-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7264-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7263-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5535003","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5535003","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chromium","Multiaccess communication","Transmitters","Media Access Protocol","Indexes","Cognitive radio","Orbits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier sense multiple access","cognitive radio","quality of service","radio links","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reactive onboard regulation","cognitive radio","malicious user","trusted domain","onboard regulation mechanism","radio behavior","radio monitoring","link quality","link state information","CSMA protocol","Aloha MAC protocol","USRP radio","GNU radio"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WOWMOM.2010.5535003","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on \"A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks\" (WoWMoM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on \"A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks\" (WoWMoM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5513765/5534887/05535003.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOWMOM.2010.5535003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5534887","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reactive on-board regulation of cognitive radios","abstract":"Malicious users may reprogram cognitive radios to disregard how their actions may harm other users. To cope with such threats, we propose that cognitive radios must have a trusted domain, which contains an onboard regulation mechanism (ORM) that `regulates' the radio's behavior by monitoring the radio, and taking appropriate action. We present a scheme for monitoring the link quality, in real-time to assess the proper action to take. Our method promptly prevents misbehavior by taking action in a manner proportional to the level by which the cognitive radio deviates from normal, allowed behavior. We demonstrate a method for the ORM to collect the link state information needed to regulate its cognitive radio. Lastly, we examine the resulting algorithms and study our regulation relative to traditional CSMA and Aloha MAC protocols on the ORBIT testbed using USRP/GNU Radios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5535003/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11455543","publicationDate":"June 2010","conferenceDate":"14-17 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5535003/","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Reactive on-board regulation of cognitive radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reactive on-board regulation of cognitive radios","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"dspan6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058669S","chronDate":"14-17 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5513765","isNumber":"5534887","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5513765","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5534887","articleId":"5535003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5535067,"authors":[{"name":"Yannis Tsividis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yannis","lastName":"Tsividis","id":"37270896700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"5535067","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":87,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":2482},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Event-Driven Data Acquisition and Digital Signal Processing\u2014A Tutorial","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5535067","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tutorial","Data acquisition","Signal processing","Signal sampling","Digital signal processing","Sampling methods","Analog-digital conversion","Frequency","Bandwidth","Quantization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","data acquisition","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["event-driven data acquisition","digital signal processing","event-driven analog-to-digital conversion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Continuous-time (CT) digital signal processing","event-driven analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion","event-driven signal processing","level crossing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2010.2056012","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/5550279/05535067.pdf","startPage":"577","endPage":"581","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2010.2056012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5550279","abstract":"Event-driven analog-to-digital conversion and associated digital signal processing techniques are reviewed.

In spite of the existence of several approaches, much effort is still required to increase the efficiency of the learning process. This study introduces a new method for the fuzzy-rule evolution that forms an expert system knowledge: the knowledge acquisition with a swarm-intelligence approach (KASIA). Specifically, this strategy is based on the use of particle-swarm optimization (PSO) to obtain the antecedents, consequences, and connectives of the rules. To test the feasibility of the suggested method, the inverted-pendulum problem is studied, and results are compared for two of the most extensively used methodologies in machine learning: the genetic-based Pittsburgh approach and the Q-learning-based strategy, i.e., state-action-reward-state-action (SARSA). Moreover, KASIA is analyzed as a learning strategy in fuzzy-rule-based metascheduler design for grid computing, and performance is compared with other scheduling strategies based on genetic learning and existing scheduling approaches, i.e., EASY-backfilling and ESG+local periodical search. To be more precise, simulation results prove the fact that the proposed strategy outperforms classical learning approaches in terms of final results and computational effort. Furthermore, the main advantage is the capability to control convergence and its simplicity.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2062525","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/5646375/05535078.pdf","startPage":"1083","endPage":"1097","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2062525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5646375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Knowledge Acquisition in Fuzzy-Rule-Based Systems With Particle-Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5535078/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Knowledge Acquisition in Fuzzy-Rule-Based Systems With Particle-Swarm Optimization","volume":"18","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11670170","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5535078/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Knowledge Acquisition in Fuzzy-Rule-Based Systems With Particle-Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-garciagalan-2062525-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093061S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"5646375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5646375","articleId":"5535078","onlineDate":"03 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5535088,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Wook Lee","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Kyung Hee University, Suwon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5765746/5535088/5535088-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jong-Wook Lee (S'02\u2013M'06\u2013SM'10) was born in Korea on April 6, 1970.

Down-converted photon pairs are generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in a two-mode waveguide (TMW). We study a class of photonic circuits comprising: 1) a nonlinear periodically poled TMW structure; 2) a set of single-mode waveguide (SMW)- and TMW-based couplers arranged in such a way that they suitably separate the three photons comprising the SPDC process; and, for some applications, 3) a holographic Bragg grating that acts as a dichroic reflector. The first circuit produces two frequency-degenerate down-converted photons, each with even spatial parity, in two separate SMWs. Changing the parameters of the elements allows this same circuit to produce two nondegenerate down-converted photons that are entangled in frequency or simultaneously entangled in frequency and polarization. The second photonic circuit is designed to produce modal entanglement by distinguishing the photons on the basis of their frequencies. A modified version of this circuit can be used to generate photons that are doubly entangled in mode number and polarization. The third photonic circuit is designed to manage dispersion by converting modal, spectral, and polarization entanglement into path entanglement.","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2010.2062494","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563994/5536899/05535096.pdf","startPage":"736","endPage":"752","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536899","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2010.2062494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Photonic Circuits for Generating Modal, Spectral, and Polarization Entanglement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5535096/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Photonic Circuits for Generating Modal, Spectral, and Polarization Entanglement","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5535096/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11498725","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"2","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Photonic Circuits for Generating Modal, Spectral, and Polarization Entanglement","sourcePdf":"jphot-saleh-2062494-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108193S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"5536899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5536899","articleId":"5535096","onlineDate":"03 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5535098,"authors":[{"name":"Shu Namiki","affiliation":["Network Photonics Research Center, National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2944/5743095/5535098/5535098-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shu Namiki (M\u201903) received M.S. degree in physics and Dr. Sci. degree in applied physics from Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan, in 1988 and 1998, respectively.","From 1988 to 2005, he was at Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd., where he was engaged in the development of award-winning high-power pump laser packaging technologies and next-generation devices for optical networks, such as ultrashort optical pulse sources, multiwavelength-pumped-fiber Raman amplifiers, high-performance erbium-doped fiber amplifiers, and nonlinear fiberoptic devices. from 1994 to 1997, he was a Visiting Scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, where he was engaged in research in mode-locked fiber lasers. in 2005, he joined the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, Japan, where he is currently the Team Leader of the Optical Signal Processing Systems Team, Network Photonics Research Center.

In fact, next-generation television (TV) standards are being explored toward the so-called 8-k definition, or ultrahigh-definition TV (UHDTV) that requires a bandwidth more than 70 Gb/s for real-time transmission. In the long run, chunks of such video data will eventually prevail over the network, and this trend would ensure a persistent traffic growth for the next decades to come. However, we will point out that the present IP-based technology cannot scale to the increasing traffic for the future mostly due to energy-consumption limits and will become a grave bottleneck for the sustainable growth of the traffic. We will then argue that the only promising solution for this would be the utilization of optical circuit switching, potentially having a few digits better energy efficiency than the present IP-router-based network. As specific implications, we are proposing the concept of the dynamic optical-path network (DOPN). We discuss how to scale the DOPN to the WAN, and show that an extremely green optical network for video-related services is possible at a clean-slate level. Then, we argue that DOPN will be first applied to LANs for broadcasting stations where a technology for scalable network interface cards are essential to accommodate the real-time UHDTV transmissions. Finally, we will briefly introduce our recent demonstration of UHDTV video transmissions using the optical time-division multiplexing based on integratable ultrafast optical devices only.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5535098/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5535098/","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2011","publicationDate":"March-April 2011","accessionNumber":"11911233","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Ultrahigh-Definition Video Transmission and Extremely Green Optical Networks for Future","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrahigh-Definition Video Transmission and Extremely Green Optical Networks for Future","sourcePdf":"jstqe-namiki-2051420-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139861S","chronDate":"March-April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"5743095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"5743095","articleId":"5535098","onlineDate":"03 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5535099,"authors":[{"name":"Rodney S.

One consequence of this expansion is a steady growth in the overall energy consumption of the network. This is the first of two papers that explore the fundamental limits on energy consumption in optical communication systems and networks. The objective of these papers is to provide a framework for understanding how this growth in energy consumption can be managed. This paper (Part I) focuses on the energy consumption in optically amplified transport systems. The accompanying paper (Part II) focuses on energy consumption in networks. A key focus of both papers is an analysis of the lower bound on energy consumption. This lower bound gives an indication of the best possible energy efficiency that could ever be achieved. The lower bound on energy in transport systems is limited by the energy consumption in optical amplifiers, and in optical transmitters and receivers. The performance of an optical transport system is ultimately set by the Shannon bound on receiver sensitivity, and depends on factors such as the modulation format, fiber losses, system length, and the spontaneous noise in optical amplifiers. Collectively, these set a lower bound on the number of amplifiers required, and hence, the amplifier energy consumption. It is possible to minimize the total energy consumption of an optically amplified system by locating repeaters strategically. The lower bound on energy consumption in optical transmitters and receivers is limited by device and circuit factors. In commercial optical transport systems, the energy consumption is at least two orders of magnitude larger than the ideal lower bounds described here. The difference between the ideal lower bounds and the actual energy consumption in commercial systems is due to inefficiencies and energy overheads. A key strategy in reducing the energy consumption of optical transport systems will be to reduce these inefficiencies and overheads.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5743095","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/5743095/05535099.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2010.2051216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2010.2051216","startPage":"245","endPage":"260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Green Optical Communications\u2014Part I: Energy Limitations in Transport","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5535099/","displayDocTitle":"Green Optical Communications\u2014Part I: Energy Limitations in Transport","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5535099/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"11911234","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2011","publicationDate":"March-April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Green Optical Communications\u2014Part I: Energy Limitations in Transport","sourcePdf":"jstqe-tucker-2051216-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140245S","chronDate":"March-April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"5743095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"5743095","articleId":"5535099","onlineDate":"03 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":5535100,"authors":[{"name":"Rodney S.

Part I covers energy consumption in optical transport. Part II explores the lower bound on energy consumption in optical switches and networks, analyzes the energy performance of a range of switching devices, and presents quantitative models of the lower bounds on energy consumption in these devices. These models are incorporated into a simple model of a global switched network and the lower bound on total network energy consumption is estimated. We compare the results of this bottom-up calculation of the lower bound on network energy with a previous top-down analysis of overall network energy consumption based on real-world data for state-of-the art equipment and \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d forward projections. The present analysis confirms a previous finding in that in a global scale network, the energy consumption of the switching infrastructure is larger than the energy consumption of the transport infrastructure. We find that the theoretical lower bounds on transport energy identified in Part I and the switching energy in this paper are more than three orders of magnitude lower than predicted by a \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d analysis. In this paper, we explore how the gap between the theoretical lower bounds on energy consumption and current trends in network energy efficiency can be closed. We argue that future research needs to focus on improving the energy efficiency of switching and on devising methods to reduce the quantity of switching infrastructure in the network. Further key strategies for reducing network energy consumption include developing of low-energy transport technologies, reducing the energy overheads associated with peripheral functions that are not central to the transport and switching of data, and reducing the energy consumption of the access network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5535100/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2011","publicationDate":"March-April 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5535100/","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2011","accessionNumber":"11911235","volume":"17","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Green Optical Communications\u2014Part II: Energy Limitations in Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Green Optical Communications\u2014Part II: Energy Limitations in Networks","sourcePdf":"jstqe-tucker-2051217-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087373S","chronDate":"March-April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"5743095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"146","xplore-issue":"5743095","articleId":"5535100","onlineDate":"03 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5535101,"authors":[{"name":"Lu Fang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/5730181/5535101/5535101-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lu Fang received the B.E. degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, in 2007.

However, the increased luminance resolution often comes at the price of chrominance distortion. A major challenge is to suppress color fringing artifacts while maintaining sharpness. In this paper, we formulate the subpixel-based down-sampling as a Min-Max problem (Min-Max Directional Error) which we call MMDE. Unfortunately, the solution of MMDE is computational intensive, especially for large images. We thus relax the MMDE by approximating the maximization operation based on HVS, which we call MMDE with Visual Relaxation (MMDE-VR). Although MMDE-VR can reduce the computational complexity of MMDE largely, it is still not acceptable for real-time implementation. We make a further simplifying assumption based on the edge relationship of neighboring pixels, which we call MMDE with Edge Relaxation (MMDE-ER).

We first elucidate the fact that the puncturing patterns of the multiple turbo codes determine the achievable diversity order by deriving their pairwise error probabilities (PEP). This is followed by a derivation of a simple power detector at the destination that can estimate a precise duration of cooperation phase upon decoding information. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of process delay due to cognitive processing at the relay, which results in the loss of diversity gain, and propose a simple null padding as its countermeasure. Computer simulations show that our proposed approach is able to achieve a full diversity and the frame error rate (FER) performance superior to that of conventional cooperative communications that make use of turbo coding structure even in practical scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2010.2055036","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2010.2055036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5689326","startPage":"197","endPage":"207","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/5689326/05535103.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5535103","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Turbo codes","Relays","Wireless sensor networks","Pairwise error probability","Phase detection","Detectors","Phase estimation","Decoding","Delay","Diversity methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","decoding","diversity reception","error statistics","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic coded cooperation","multiple turbo codes","wireless relay networks","sensing device","pairwise error probabilities","diversity order","puncturing patterns","power detector","cooperation phase","decoding information","process delay","cognitive processing","diversity gain","frame error rate","conventional cooperative communications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative communications","distributed turbo codes","dynamic decode-and-forward (DDF)","multiple turbo codes","power detection","transmit diversity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Coded Cooperation Using Multiple Turbo Codes in Wireless Relay Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11759849","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5535103/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5535103/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Coded Cooperation Using Multiple Turbo Codes in Wireless Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"jstsp-ishibashi-2055036-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078724S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"5689326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5689326","articleId":"5535103","onlineDate":"03 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":5535112,"authors":[{"name":"He Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, MS, USA"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"Yang","id":"37403890200"},{"name":"Qian Du","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, MS, USA"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Du","id":"37267187900"},{"name":"Ben Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, MS, USA"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Ma","id":"37400229300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"5535112","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":750},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Hyperspectral sensors","Voting","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Training data","Feature extraction","Image classification","Student members"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","feature extraction","image classification","image fusion","pattern clustering","set theory","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision fusion","supervised classifier","unsupervised classifier","hyperspectral imagery","support vector machine","k-means clustering","object-based classification","spectral centroid"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decision-level fusion","hyperspectral imagery","supervised classification","unsupervised classification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5535112","abstract":"A decision fusion approach is developed to combine the results from supervised and unsupervised classifiers.

The method allows for an iterative bootstrapping and refinement of the inverse kinematics estimate. The essential novelty lies in a path-based sampling approach: we generate training data along paths, which result from execution of the currently learned estimate along a desired path towards a goal. The information structure thereby induced enables an efficient detection and resolution of inconsistent samples solely from directly observable data. We derive and illustrate the exploration and learning process with a low-dimensional kinematic example that provides direct insight into the bootstrapping process. We further show that the method scales for high dimensional problems, such as the Honda humanoid robot or hyperredundant planar arms with up to 50 degrees of freedom.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5535131/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5535131/","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11521411","volume":"2","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Goal Babbling Permits Direct Learning of Inverse Kinematics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Goal Babbling Permits Direct Learning of Inverse Kinematics","sourcePdf":"tamd-rolf-2062511-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132002S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4563672","isNumber":"5568771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563672","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"5568771","articleId":"5535131","onlineDate":"03 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5535136,"authors":[{"name":"Shin-Chi Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shin-Chi","lastName":"Lai","id":"37530687900"},{"name":"Wen-Ho Juang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Ho","lastName":"Juang","id":"37543893500"},{"name":"Chia-Lin Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Lin","lastName":"Chang","id":"37535310200"},{"name":"Chen-Chieh Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chen-Chieh","lastName":"Lin","id":"37536593400"},{"name":"Ching-Hsing Luo","affiliation":["Institute of Nanotechnology and Microsystems Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Hsing","lastName":"Luo","id":"37292272600"},{"name":"Sheau-Fang Lei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sheau-Fang","lastName":"Lei","id":"37288502400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"5535136","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":584},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital Radio Mondiale","Receivers","Discrete Fourier transforms","Hardware","Cathode ray tubes","Costs","Adders","Digital modulation","Frequency modulation","Modulation coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","CMOS digital integrated circuits","digital radio","discrete Fourier transforms","multiplying circuits","OFDM modulation","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-computation-cycle","power-efficient","reconfigurable design","recursive discrete Fourier transform","digital radio mondiale receiver","prime factor algorithm","Chinese reminder theorem","recursive algorithm","multicycle RDFT algorithm","coded orthogonal frequency-division-multiplexing modulation","1P6M CMOS process","power 8.44 mW","frequency 25 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital audio broadcasting","digital radio mondiale (DRM)","discrete Fourier transform (DFT)","hardware accelerator","recursive filters"]}],"abstract":"Low-cost, fast-computational, power-efficient, and reconfigurable design for recursive discrete Fourier transform (RDFT) is proposed in this brief. The proposed method is the first integration that collated both the prime factor algorithm (PFA) and the Chinese reminder theorem (CRT) into a recursive algorithm. Hence, a multicycle RDFT algorithm (PFA + CRT + RDFT) and its hardware implementation are produced and presented here in great detail. Compared with some well-known recursive algorithms, the significant improvements for the proposed algorithm can be summarized as follows: 1) The number of computational cycles of the proposed algorithm can be saved by up to 88.5%; 2) The number of multiplications and additions for the proposed algorithm is dramatically reduced by up to 85.2% and 85.2%, respectively; 3) The amount of coefficient read-only memory for storing the twiddle factors totally takes 694 words fewer than those of other existing RDFT algorithms; 4) The hardware cost of the proposed algorithm only takes four real multipliers and eight real adders. This design is more suitable for digital radio mondiale (DRM) systems, such as coded orthogonal frequency-division-multiplexing modulation. The proposed RDFT algorithm was designed and fabricated using a 0.18-\u03bcm 1P6M CMOS process.

The accepted position estimates are weighted with different probabilities in a Kalman filter framework. Simulation results show a significant increase in positioning accuracy in NLOS environments with respect to both, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and a NLOS mitigation algorithm from the literature.

There are M distributed players competing for N independent arms. Each arm, when played, offers i.i.d. reward according to a distribution with an unknown parameter. At each time, each player chooses one arm to play without exchanging observations or any information with other players. Players choosing the same arm collide, and, depending on the collision model, either no one receives reward or the colliding players share the reward in an arbitrary way. We show that the minimum system regret of the decentralized MAB grows with time at the same logarithmic order as in the centralized counterpart where players act collectively as a single entity by exchanging observations and making decisions jointly. A decentralized policy is constructed to achieve this optimal order while ensuring fairness among players and without assuming any pre-agreement or information exchange among players. Based on a time-division fair sharing (TDFS) of the M best arms, the proposed policy is constructed and its order optimality is proven under a general reward model. Furthermore, the basic structure of the TDFS policy can be used with any order-optimal single-player policy to achieve order optimality in the decentralized setting. We also establish a lower bound on the system regret for a general class of decentralized polices, to which the proposed policy belongs. This problem finds potential applications in cognitive radio networks, multi-channel communication systems, multi-agent systems, web search and advertising, and social networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5599326/05535151.pdf","startPage":"5667","endPage":"5681","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2062509","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2062509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5599326","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5535151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Learning in Multi-Armed Bandit With Multiple Players","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arm","Cognitive radio","Web search","Advertising","Permission","Social network services","Laboratories","USA Councils","Radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","multi-agent systems","social networking (online)","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed learning","multiple players","decentralized multi-armed bandit","time-division fair sharing","cognitive radio networks","multi-channel communication systems","multi-agent systems","web search and advertising","social networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","decentralized multi-armed bandit","distributed learning","multi-agent systems","system regret","Web search and advertising"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5535151/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Learning in Multi-Armed Bandit With Multiple Players","volume":"58","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5535151/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11575488","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Learning in Multi-Armed Bandit With Multiple Players","sourcePdf":"tsp-liu-2062509-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064887S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5599326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"213","xplore-issue":"5599326","articleId":"5535151","onlineDate":"03 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5535152,"authors":[{"name":"Jiasong Wu","affiliation":["Laboratory of Image Science and Technology, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China","INSERM, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Jiasong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37537247100"},{"name":"Huazhong Shu","affiliation":["Laboratory of Image Science and Technology, School of Computer Science and Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Huazhong","lastName":"Shu","id":"37287366300"},{"name":"Lu Wang","affiliation":["Laboratory of Image Science and Technology, School of Computer Science and Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37539350800"},{"name":"Lotfi Senhadji","affiliation":["INSERM, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Lotfi","lastName":"Senhadji","id":"37294373800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"5535152","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":537},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5535152","abstract":"Fast algorithms for computing the forward and inverse sequency-ordered complex Hadamard transforms (SCHT) in a sliding window are presented.

The forward SCHT algorithm can be obtained by transposing the signal flow graph of the ISCHT. The proposed algorithms require O(N) arithmetic operations and thus are more efficient than the block-based algorithms as well as those based on the sliding FFT or the sliding DFT. The application of the sliding ISCHT in transform domain adaptive filtering (TDAF) is also discussed with supporting simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2063026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5599326","startPage":"5901","endPage":"5909","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5599326/05535152.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2063026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Algorithms for the Computation of Sliding Sequency-Ordered Complex Hadamard Transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","Fourier transforms","Permission","Laboratories","Discrete transforms","Discrete cosine transforms","Biomedical computing","Flow graphs","Arithmetic","Adaptive filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","computational complexity","discrete Fourier transforms","graph theory","Hadamard transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sliding sequency-ordered complex Hadamard transform","sliding window","length-N inverse SCHT decomposition","modified ISCHT algorithm","computation complexity","implementation complexity","signal flow graph","sliding DFT","sliding FFT","transform domain adaptive filtering","TDAF","block-based algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fast algorithm","sequency-ordered complex Hadamard transform","sliding algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Fast Algorithms for the Computation of Sliding Sequency-Ordered Complex Hadamard Transform","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5535152/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5535152/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11575462","pubMedId":"21909229","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Algorithms for the Computation of Sliding Sequency-Ordered Complex Hadamard Transform","sourcePdf":"tsp-shu-2063026-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110076S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5599326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5599326","articleId":"5535152","onlineDate":"03 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5535154,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoming Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37403981600"},{"name":"Zhaoyang Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhaoyang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279636300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"5535154","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":666},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Performance gain","System performance","Space time codes","Central Processing Unit","Content addressable storage","Fading","Channel state information","Antennas and propagation","Block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","block codes","channel coding","correlation methods","direction-of-arrival estimation","linear codes","MIMO communication","orthogonal codes","precoding","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel angular domain information parameter","optimal precoder design","distributed antenna systems","linear preceding","distributed orthogonal space time block codes","angle of arrival estimation","normalized antenna spacing","Ricean K-factor","MIMO channel correlation matrix","realistic nonKronecker channel model","channel precoder","power allocator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Angular domain information","distributed antenna system","distributed space-time codes","diversity order","non-Kronecker channel model","precoder design"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the benefit of linear precoding along with distributed orthogonal space time block codes (OSTBCs) is exploited to improve the performance of distributed antenna system (DAS). In particular, we propose a novel precoder design method based on channel angular domain parameters, i.e., average angle of arrival (AOA), angular spread (AS), normalized antenna spacing (NAS) and Ricean K-factor, instead of the conventional channel correlation matrix which has been widely used to characterize MIMO channel. Built on the distributed characteristics of DAS, a more realistic non-Kronecker channel model is established, and then the optimal precoder is designed as a function of the above angular domain parameters. Asymptotic analysis reveals that, the optimal precoder acts as a combination of channel precoder and power allocator. Furthermore, the impact of the above angular domain parameters on system performance, including diversity order and coding advantage, is investigated in detail. Specifically, we find that better gain can be achieved with larger K-factor. Finally, our theoretical claims are confirmed by the numerical results.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2062508","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5599326/05535154.pdf","startPage":"5791","endPage":"5801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2062508","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5599326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Channel Angular Domain Information for Precoder Design in Distributed Antenna Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5535154","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5535154/","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Channel Angular Domain Information for Precoder Design in Distributed Antenna Systems","volume":"58","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11575489","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Channel Angular Domain Information for Precoder Design in Distributed Antenna Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-zhang-2062508-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046795S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","isNumber":"5599326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"24","articleId":"5535154","onlineDate":"03 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5535156,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Ming Yen","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, College of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5601981/5535156/5535156-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chih-Ming Yen was born in Tainan, Taiwan.

The U_TMCR scheme allocates subchannels, antenna sequence, and modulation order to multimedia users with goals not only to maximize system throughput under quality-of-service (QoS) guarantee but to reduce computational complexity as well. Based on the channel quality and the QoS requirements of each user, the U_TMCR scheme designs a utility function for every user and formulates the scheduling into an optimization problem of overall system utility function subject to system constraints. It also contains a heuristic TMCR algorithm to efficiently solve the optimization problem. Simulation results show that the U_TMCR scheme achieves system throughput very close to the optimal solution by exhaustive search and higher than conventional schemes such as adaptive radio resource allocation (ARRA) and cross-layer design of packet scheduling (CDPS) by about 8% and 21%, respectively. The U_TMCR scheme also has a QoS satisfaction ratio that is better than the ARRA and CDPS schemes. Moreover, the U_TMCR scheme can reduce computational complexity.

In this paper, we develop a new unified framework for the exact ergodic capacity of multihop networks equipped with variable-gain relays, assuming that channel-state information (CSI) is available only at the receiving terminals. The resulting expression (which is based on the exact end-to-end SNR) is in the form of a single truncated infinite series and is valid for an arbitrary number of hops and for various fading models that are typically encountered in realistic scenarios. Furthermore, we show that the exact ergodic capacity of dual-hop variable-gain relay networks can be written in terms of the ergodic capacities of two equivalent single-input-single-output (SISO) channels and one single-input-multiple-output channel (SIMO), the closed-form expressions of which are already available for many commonly used fading/shadowing models.

These problems become more baneful in high-power and high-speed applications. For example, in the transport industry, they lead to high energy consumption, high input current that occupies transmission line capacity, and phase unbalance. Thus, it is necessary to overcome these problems; furthermore, the decrease in motor weight results in lower cost and better performance of linear induction motors. In this paper, first we present an accurate equivalent circuit model (ECM). Then, we introduce a new factor, K\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">lee</sub>\n, which can illustrate the end effect intensity in the LIM. At the next stage, we investigate the influence of motor design parameters on the efficiency, power factor, and end effect intensity. Then we develop several different muliobjective functions, which will be used to improve efficiency, power factor, end effect intensity, and motor weight. This procedure will be done by analytic method and by using the particle swarm optimization technique. Results will show the accuracy of the equivalent circuit model and the improvement of objective functions at the end of the optimization procedure.

For magnetic levitation, a Halbach linear active magnetic bearing (HLAMB) is used. The HLAMB has two functions: gravity compensation and actively control of vertical motion. To implement these functions, the HLAMB utilizes permanent magnet arrays and Lorentz coils. The fine stage has positioning capabilities with 6 DOF due to four HLAMBs and four voice coil motors (VCM). The HLAMBs control out-of-plane motions, and the VCM control in-plane motions. The fine stage achieves high-precision position feedback using laser interferometers and capacitive sensors. The coarse stage has an H-type structure that can carry the fine stage 300 mm by 300 mm along the x - and y-axes. Positioning and scanning performances are verified by the experimental results. It has \u00b110 and \u00b115 nm in-position stability in the x- and y-axes, respectively.

Furthermore, the work proves that SHH is better than HH in functional approximation, i.e., the optimal error of SHH approximating a general function is always smaller or equal to that of HH.

These motors should be capable of continued functional operation, even if insulation failure or open-circuit of a winding occur. This paper presents a fault-tolerant (FT) torque controller for brushless dc (BLdc) motors that can maintain accurate torque production with minimum power dissipation, even if one of its phases fails. The distinct feature of the FT controller is that it is applicable to BLdc motors with any back-electromotive-force waveform. First, an observer estimates the phase voltages from a model based on Fourier coefficients of the motor waveform. The faulty phases are detected from the covariance of the estimation error. Subsequently, the phase currents of the remaining phases are optimally reshaped so that the motor accurately generates torque as requested while minimizing power loss subject to maximum current limitation of the current amplifiers. Experimental results illustrate the capability of the FT controller to achieve ripple-free torque performance during a phase failure at the expenses of increasing the mean and maximum power loss by 28% and 68% and decreasing the maximum motor torque by 49%.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault-Tolerant Torque Control of BLDC Motors","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2060361","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5710539/05535190.pdf","startPage":"355","endPage":"363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2060361","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5710539","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5535190","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5535190/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Fault-Tolerant Torque Control of BLDC Motors","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5535190/","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2011","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11793981","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault-Tolerant Torque Control of BLDC Motors","sourcePdf":"tpel-aghili-2060361-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059132S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5710539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5710539","articleId":"5535190","onlineDate":"03 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5535191,"authors":[{"name":"Enekoitz Ormaetxea","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, University of Basque Country (UPV-EHU), Bilbao, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5677632/5535191/5535191-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Enekoitz Ormaetxea received the M.Sc. degree in telecommunication engineering in 2007 from the University of the Basque Country, Bilbao, Spain, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","He is currently a Researcher in the Applied Electronic Research Group, Electronics and Telecommunications Department, University of the Basque Country.

Traditionally, the MC has been controlled by means of a DSP, together with a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The sole aim of the latter is to perform the safe commutation of the converter. This involves a waste of resources, as the excellent features of the FPGA are infrautilized by the control system. This paper deals with the implementation of the double-sided space vector modulation (DS SVM), commutation, reference-frame changes, and protection of the MC through a series of hardware blocks (cores) integrally implemented in an FPGA. The designed cores are technology-independent descriptions, which means that the developed design can be used in the FPGAs of any manufacturer. Moreover, the proposed design, which has been validated experimentally, has obviated the need to use a DSP. Likewise, given that all the processing capabilities have been integrated in a single chip, it can be said that an FPGA-based system on a programmable chip (SoPC) has been designed. Due to the computational capacity of the developed cores, processing time is reduced to the order of nanoseconds. This allows a response in real time and very high modulation frequencies can be attained. Moreover, these cores operate independently, and simultaneously, therefore obviating the need for sequential control and its resulting latencies and leading to an increase in the safety of the MC.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5535191/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11728033","htmlLink":"/document/5535191/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"26","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Matrix Converter Protection and Computational Capabilities Based on a System on Chip Design With an FPGA","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matrix Converter Protection and Computational Capabilities Based on a System on Chip Design With an FPGA","sourcePdf":"tpel-andreu-2062539-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128758S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5677632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5677632","articleId":"5535191","onlineDate":"03 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5535193,"authors":[{"name":"Kung-Min Ho","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Technology, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5675792/5535193/5535193-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kung-Min Ho received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering, in 2009 from the National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","His research interests include design of switching power converters and digital control of power factor correction technology."]},"firstName":"Kung-Min","lastName":"Ho","id":"37534800400"},{"name":"Chia-An Yeh","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Technology, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5675792/5535193/5535193-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Chia-An Yeh (S'09) received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering, in 2006 from the National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","His research interests include digital control of switching power converters, including modeling, design, simulation, and field-programmable gate array and/or DSP implementation."]},"firstName":"Chia-An","lastName":"Yeh","id":"37290084600"},{"name":"Yen-Shin Lai","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Technology, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5675792/5535193/5535193-photo-3-source-small.gif","p":["Yen-Shin Lai (M'96\u2013SM'01) received the M.S. degree from the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Bristol, Bristol, U.K., both in electronic engineering.","In 1987, he joined Electrical Engineering Department, National Taipei University of Technology, as a Lecturer, where he has been a Full Professor, since 1999, was the Chairperson during 2003\u20132006, and has been a Distinguished Professor, since 2006.

For the presented technique, the switching period to retain zero-current switching is predicted rather than sampling the current in real time. Moreover, the related turn-ON period is determined by the voltage controller. Therefore, neither zero-current detection nor high-frequency A/D converter for current sampling is required. Moreover, for interleaved topology with master-slave control, a new ON-time compensation technique is proposed to significantly improve the slave inductor-current distortion, and thereby, achieving current sharing control between phases. Experimental results derived from a DSP-based controller are presented for confirmation. The PFC is with 100 Vac/50 Hz input and 400 Vdc output. The power rating is 460 W. Experimental results show that the power factor is higher than 0.98, efficiency is greater than 96%, and the current sharing can be achieved by the proposed ON-time compensation technique.

The primary market target of the converter is within the telecommunications industry where it supplies high-quality dc power to the telecom loads and performs high-capacity battery charging while providing zero harmonic emission and unity power factor to the utility grid. The main design objective is to produce the lowest cost within a small-size system. The study includes mathematical analysis and simulation steps where the optimum number of cells to be interleaved and the associated phase shifts among the cells are determined while the emphasis being on the design of a perfectly coupled flyback transformer. Design of a transformer with the lowest leakage inductance and selection of components providing the lowest parasitic effects are critical for obtaining high efficiency and good performance. After the design is verified through simulation studies that uses Simulink and piecewise linear electrical circuit simulation model (PLECS) of the converter, a full-scale prototype is implemented to evaluate the performance of the design. In conclusion, experimental results demonstrate that converter works successfully and meets the commercialization expectations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reactive power","AC-DC power converters","Topology","Flyback transformers","Communication industry","Telecommunications","Batteries","Power system harmonics","Costs","Mathematical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-DC power convertors","mathematical analysis","power factor","power transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-phase unity power factor","single-stage ac-dc converter","interleaved flyback topology","telecommunications industry","telecom loads","high-capacity battery charging","utility grid","mathematical analysis","coupled flyback transformer","piecewise linear electrical circuit simulation model","Simulink"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Flyback converter","flyback transformer","interleaved converter","single-stage converter","unity-power-factor rectifier"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2060359","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5677632/05535195.pdf","startPage":"308","endPage":"318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5677632","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2060359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Three-Phase Unity Power Factor Single-Stage AC\u2013DC Converter Based on an Interleaved Flyback Topology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5535195","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Three-Phase Unity Power Factor Single-Stage AC\u2013DC Converter Based on an Interleaved Flyback Topology","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5535195/","volume":"26","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5535195/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11733360","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Three-Phase Unity Power Factor Single-Stage AC\u2013DC Converter Based on an Interleaved Flyback Topology","sourcePdf":"tpel-tamyurek-2060359-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112298S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5677632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"5677632","articleId":"5535195","onlineDate":"03 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5535200,"authors":[{"name":"Arindam Basu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/5586708/5535200/5535200-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Arindam Basu (M'10) received the B.Tech and M.Tech degrees in electronics and electrical communication engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, in 2005, and received the M.S. degree in mathematics and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, in 2009 and 2010, respectively.","He is an Assistant Professor in the School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

This chip provides a platform for not only simulating detailed neuron dynamics but also uses the same to interface with actual cells in applications such as a dynamic clamp. There are 28 computational analog blocks (CAB), each consisting of ion channels with tunable parameters, synapses, winner-take-all elements, current sources, transconductance amplifiers, and capacitors. There are four other CABs which have programmable bias generators. The programmability is achieved using floating gate transistors with on-chip programming control. The switch matrix for interconnecting the components in CABs also consists of floating-gate transistors. Emphasis is placed on replicating the detailed dynamics of computational neural models.

The main contradictory problem lies between error-resilient and bandwidth usage. Additional redundant data has to be added to achieve robust transmission which leads to huge bandwidth usage. In this paper, an error-resilient scheme called Wyner-Ziv Error-Resilient (WZER) based on a receiver driven layered Wyner-Ziv (WZ) coding framework is proposed. The WZER purposely emphasizes on the protection of the Region of Interest (ROI) area in the frame thus to achieve the better tradeoff between the bandwidth usage and error-resilience. WZER is designed to work for the scenario of wavelet based video coding over packet erasure channel, where several techniques including automatic ROI detection, ROI mask generation, Rate distortion optimization (RDO) quantization, WZ coding with layer design, and packet level Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) code are used. The performances of the proposed WZER are simulated based on average PSNR of luminance, perceptual reconstruction and bandwidth usage and compared with normal Forward Error Correction (FEC) full protection scheme and no protection scheme. The results show the advantages of the proposed WZER over traditional FEC protection, especially in the aspects of the recovery of the subject area and bandwidth efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2010.2058371","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/5623279/05535201.pdf","startPage":"481","endPage":"493","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2010.2058371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5623279","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5535201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error-Resilient Scheme for Wavelet Video Codec Using Automatic ROI Detection and Wyner-Ziv Coding Over Packet Erasure Channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5535201/","displayDocTitle":"Error-Resilient Scheme for Wavelet Video Codec Using Automatic ROI Detection and Wyner-Ziv Coding Over Packet Erasure Channel","volume":"56","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5535201/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11655184","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error-Resilient Scheme for Wavelet Video Codec Using Automatic ROI Detection and Wyner-Ziv Coding Over Packet Erasure Channel","sourcePdf":"tbc-loo-2058371-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091181S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"5623279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5623279","articleId":"5535201","onlineDate":"03 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5535202,"authors":[{"name":"Jongrok Park","affiliation":["Center of Information Technology of Yonsei, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/5623279/5535202/5535202-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jongrok Park (S'08) was born in Korea in 1983.

Multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) and multihop relay technologies are viable options for improving QoS of MBMS. For stable MBMS, the average throughput of overall cell region must be guaranteed. Nevertheless, severe throughput degradation may occur in the outer region of multicells due to significant interference from neighboring cells or relay stations, thereby limiting the overall performance. This paper describes an effective technique, which combines MIMO and two-hop relay, to guarantee the QoS of edge users. We assume that the channel between the base station (BS) and the fixed relay station (FRS) is line-of-sight (LOS). First, we define a criterion needed to install the FRS. Second, we construct a weight matrix for hybrid relaying having lower complexity than digital relaying. Finally, we propose a user scheduling algorithm which can be adapted to analog relaying (amplify and forward), digital relaying (decode and forward) and hybrid relaying (filter, amplify and forward). The simulation results show that the proposed method can improve both the QoS of edge users and the sum-rate.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2010.2058031","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/5623279/05535202.pdf","startPage":"494","endPage":"503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2010.2058031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5623279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Beamforming for QoS Enhancement via Analog, Digital and Hybrid Relaying","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5535202","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5535202/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Beamforming for QoS Enhancement via Analog, Digital and Hybrid Relaying","volume":"56","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11655185","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5535202/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Beamforming for QoS Enhancement via Analog, Digital and Hybrid Relaying","sourcePdf":"tbc-park-2058031-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139714S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"5623279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5623279","articleId":"5535202","onlineDate":"03 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5535205,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto Frasca","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Sannio, Benevento, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5667090/5535205/5535205-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Roberto Frasca (S'05-M'08) was born in Benevento, Italy, in 1976.

The use of sharp and narrow pulses, similar to impulse-radio ultrawideband (IR-UWB) in the far-field domain, leads to significant reduction in the transmitter power consumption. However unlike IR-UWB, where all pulses are the same, in PHM each bit consists of a pattern of pulses with specific time delays and amplitudes, which minimize the intersymbol interference (ISI) across the receiver coil. This helps achieve a high data rate without reducing the inductive link quality factor and selectivity, which are necessary to block interferers. The received signal consists of an oscillation pattern that is amplitude modulated by the amplitude and timing of the successively transmitted pulses to facilitate data demodulation with low bit-error rate (BER). The main application of the PHM is expected to be in the neuroprostheses, such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) or cochlear/retinal implants, which need to transfer large volumes of data across the skin. It may also be used in short-range proximity-based digital communications with high-throughput wireless devices. This paper describes the PHM theoretical foundation and demonstrates its operation with a proof-of-concept prototype setup, which achieves a data rate of 5.2 Mbps at 1 cm coil separation with a BER of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">- 6</sup>\n .","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5676420/05535209.pdf","startPage":"186","endPage":"195","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2010.2055351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2010.2055351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5676420","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5535209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband Near-Field Data Transmission Using Pulse Harmonic Modulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse modulation","Data communication","Prognostics and health management","Bit error rate","Intersymbol interference","Coils","Power system harmonics","Telemetry","Ultra wideband technology","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","demodulation","digital communication","error statistics","inductive power transmission","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","pulse modulation","Q-factor","radio links","ultra wideband technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband near-field data transmission","pulse harmonic modulation","wideband low power data transmission","inductive telemetry links","impulse-radio ultrawideband","IR-UWB","transmitter power consumption","time delays","intersymbol interference","receiver coil","oscillation pattern","low bit-error rate","data demodulation","BER","brain-computer interfaces","high-throughput wireless devices","inductive link quality factor","bit rate 5.2 Mbit/s","size 1 cm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Implantable medical devices","impulse radio ultrawideband","inductive coupling","near-field","neuroprostheses","pulse harmonic modulation","telemetry"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5535209/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Wideband Near-Field Data Transmission Using Pulse Harmonic Modulation","volume":"58","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5535209/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11727762","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband Near-Field Data Transmission Using Pulse Harmonic Modulation","sourcePdf":"tcsi-ghovanloo-2055351-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076964S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5676420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5676420","articleId":"5535209","onlineDate":"03 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5535211,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Shi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5676420/5535211/5535211-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dong Shi (S'07) received the B.Eng. degree in electronic engineering from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China in 2006.

In the case of stationary leaders, we propose a distributed containment control algorithm and study conditions on the network topology and the control gains to guarantee asymptotic containment control in any dimensional space. In the case of dynamic leaders, we study two cases: leaders with an identical velocity and leaders with nonidentical velocities. For the first case, we propose two distributed containment control algorithms to solve, respectively, asymptotic containment control under a switching directed network topology and finite-time containment control under a fixed directed network topology. In particular, asymptotic containment control can be achieved for any dimensional space if the network topology is fixed and for only the 1-D space if the network topology is switching. For the second case, we propose a distributed containment control algorithm under a fixed network topology where the communication patterns among the followers are undirected and derive conditions on the network topology and the control gains to guarantee asymptotic containment control for any dimensional space. Both simulation results and experimental results on a multi-robot platform are provided to validate some theoretical results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Containment Control for Multiple Autonomous Vehicles With Double-Integrator Dynamics: Algorithms and Experiments","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2010.2053542","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/5888505/05535214.pdf","startPage":"929","endPage":"938","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2010.2053542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5888505","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5535214","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5535214/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Containment Control for Multiple Autonomous Vehicles With Double-Integrator Dynamics: Algorithms and Experiments","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5535214/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12063126","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Containment Control for Multiple Autonomous Vehicles With Double-Integrator Dynamics: Algorithms and Experiments","sourcePdf":"tcst-ren-2053542-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066911S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"5888505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"363","xplore-issue":"5888505","articleId":"5535214","onlineDate":"03 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5535219,"authors":[{"name":"Radu-Emil Precup","affiliation":["Depart of Automation and Applied Informatics (DAAI), Polytechnic University of Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"bio":{"p":["Radu-Emil Precup (M'03\u2013SM'07) received the Dipl.

The cornerstone of this construction is a stochastic model describing the probability of executing, in each activation of the controller, the different subroutines.

Following a brief introduction to the common types of EV batteries and their charging characteristics, an analytical solution for predicting the EV charging load is developed. The method is stochastically formulated so as to account for the stochastic nature of the start time of individual battery charging and the initial battery state-of-charge. A comparative study is carried out by simulating four EV charging scenarios, i.e., uncontrolled domestic charging, uncontrolled off-peak domestic charging, \u201csmart\u201d domestic charging and uncontrolled public charging-commuters capable of recharging at the workplace. The proposed four EVs charging scenarios take into account the expected future changes to the electricity tariffs in the electricity market place and appropriate regulation of EVs battery charging loads. A typical U.K. distribution system is adopted as an example. The time-series data of EV charging loads is taken from two commercially available EV batteries: lead-acid and lithium-ion. Results show that a 10% market penetration of EVs in the studied system would result in an increase in daily peak demand by up to 17.9%, while a 20% level of EV penetration would lead to a 35.8% increase in peak load, for the scenario of uncontrolled domestic charging-the \u201cworst-case\u201d scenario.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5535237/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","volume":"26","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11961060","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5535237/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of Load Demand Due to EV Battery Charging in Distribution Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of Load Demand Due to EV Battery Charging in Distribution Systems","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-qian-2057456-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086466S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5753358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"721","xplore-issue":"5753358","articleId":"5535237","onlineDate":"03 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5535240,"authors":[{"name":"Fangxing Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Fangxing (Fran) Li (M'01-SM'05) received the Ph.D. degree from Virginia Tech in 2001.","He was with ABB, Raleigh, NC, as a Senior and then a Principal Engineer for four and one-half years.

For these reasons, considerable activity has been carried out in the United States and Europe to formulate and promote a vision for the development of future smart power grids. However, the majority of these activities emphasized only the distribution grid and demand side leaving the big picture of the transmission grid in the context of smart grids unclear. This paper presents a unique vision for the future of smart transmission grids in which their major features are identified. In this vision, each smart transmission grid is regarded as an integrated system that functionally consists of three interactive, smart components, i.e., smart control centers, smart transmission networks, and smart substations. The features and functions of each of the three functional components, as well as the enabling technologies to achieve these features and functions, are discussed in detail in the paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5535240/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2010","volume":"1","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"11476896","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5535240/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Smart Transmission Grid: Vision and Framework","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart Transmission Grid: Vision and Framework","sourcePdf":"tsg-xia-2053726-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125437S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"5552162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"635","xplore-issue":"5552162","articleId":"5535240","onlineDate":"03 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5535250,"authors":[{"name":"Behrooz Makki","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Behrooz","lastName":"Makki","id":"37289967200"},{"name":"Thomas Eriksson","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Eriksson","id":"37268342000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"5535250","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":352},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"This letter studies the effect of channel side information on the achievable rates of quasi-static fading channels.

The validity of the method mentioned can be proved by simulation and the experiment result.","doi":"10.1109/MACE.2010.5535410","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510905/5535256/05535410.pdf","startPage":"3586","endPage":"3589","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Mechanic Automation and Control Engineering","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Mechanic Automation and Control Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MACE.2010.5535410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5535256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power consumption prediction of submerged arc furnace based on multi-input layer wavelet neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5535410/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Power consumption prediction of submerged arc furnace based on multi-input layer wavelet neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11461442","publicationDate":"June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5535410/","conferenceDate":"26-28 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power consumption prediction of submerged arc furnace based on multi-input layer wavelet neural network","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"E803337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055631S","chronDate":"26-28 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5510905","isNumber":"5535256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510905","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5535256","articleId":"5535410","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5535559,"authors":[{"name":"Longxin Zhen","affiliation":["Automotive Vibration and Noise Research Institute, Yanshan University\uc2a0, Qinhuangdao, China"],"lastName":"Longxin Zhen","id":"37088311567"},{"name":"Zijun An","affiliation":["Automotive Vibration and Noise Research Institute, Yanshan University\uc2a0, Qinhuangdao, China"],"lastName":"Zijun An","id":"37087168038"},{"name":"Qiang Li","affiliation":["College of Mechanical Engineering, Yanshan University\uc2a0, Qinhuangdao, China"],"lastName":"Qiang Li","id":"37088314466"},{"name":"Baocheng Wang","affiliation":["College of Electric Engineering, Yanshan University\uc2a0, Qinhuangdao, China"],"lastName":"Baocheng Wang","id":"37087148996"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7739-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7737-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7738-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5535559","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":340},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Engines","Acceleration","Flywheels","MATLAB","Angular velocity","Frequency","Low pass filters","Hardware","Combustion","Stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acceleration","flywheels","IIR filters","internal combustion engines","low-pass filters","shafts"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["engine crankshaft angular acceleration","original flywheel data","MATLAB","zero phase IIR low pass filter","engine combustion stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["engine crankshaft","angular acceleration","flywheel","combustion stability"]}],"abstract":"This paper presented a new method to obtain crankshaft angular acceleration using MATLAB.

The proposed adaptive beamformer was formulated as a linear programming problem with second-order cone semi-infinite constraints, which can be eliminated by using the sampling technique. In this paper, we transform these semi-infinite second-order cone constraints into some norm constraints and linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints. The advantage of this new formulation of the problem is that the sampling of the angles is avoided. The exact optimal result of the problem can be obtained instead of the approximated one provided by sampling technique. The resultant beamformer possesses superior robustness against arbitrary array imperfections and high performance on signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) enhancement even with a large controlled robust response region.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5536945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","startPage":"2131","endPage":"2134","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05536945.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust response control with linear inequality matrix constraints for adaptive beamformer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5536945/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5536945/","displayDocTitle":"Robust response control with linear inequality matrix constraints for adaptive beamformer","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462725","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust response control with linear inequality matrix constraints for adaptive beamformer","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"05401763.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065227S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5536945","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5536946,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Zhou","affiliation":["State-Key Laboratory of ASIC & System, Micro-/Nano-Electronics Innovation Platform, FUDAN University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37536452500"},{"name":"Liang Liu","affiliation":["State-Key Laboratory of ASIC & System, Micro-/Nano-Electronics Innovation Platform, FUDAN University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37539366600"},{"name":"Fan Ye","affiliation":["State-Key Laboratory of ASIC & System, Micro-/Nano-Electronics Innovation Platform, FUDAN University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Ye","id":"37289420800"},{"name":"Junyan Ren","affiliation":["State-Key Laboratory of ASIC & System, Micro-/Nano-Electronics Innovation Platform, FUDAN University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Junyan","lastName":"Ren","id":"37288701600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5536946","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":231},"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the analog front-end imperfection in multi-band orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MB-OFDM) ultra-wideband (UWB) systems and propose a joint estimation and compensation scheme.

dual-carrier MB-OFDM transceivers covering 11 frequency bands from 6.2GHz to 9.4GHz and 3 frequency bands from 4.2GHz to 4.8GHz, each with a bandwidth of 264MHz. Careful band plan is made to minimize the complexity. The synthesizer generates 14 carrier frequencies from a single frequency source. Improvements are made to the circuits to further suppress the sidebands. The synthesizer chip is designed with TSMC's 0.13-\u03bcm RF CMOS technology. The circuit draws a current of 42mA from a 1.2V supply. It achieves a sideband rejection of 45dBc and a phase noise of -105dBc/Hz@1MHz.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5536947","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05536947.pdf","startPage":"2139","endPage":"2192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5536947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A sideband-suppressed low-power synthesizer for 14-band dual-carrier MB-OFDM UWB transceivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5536947","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5536947/","displayDocTitle":"A sideband-suppressed low-power synthesizer for 14-band dual-carrier MB-OFDM UWB transceivers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462727","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5536947/","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sideband-suppressed low-power synthesizer for 14-band dual-carrier MB-OFDM UWB transceivers","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"05421731.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068336S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5536947","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5536948,"authors":[{"name":"Eleni Fotopoulou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Eleni","lastName":"Fotopoulou","id":"37281690900"},{"name":"Dorina Thanou","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communications Sciences, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Dorina","lastName":"Thanou","id":"37541739000"},{"name":"Thanos Stouraitis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Thanos","lastName":"Stouraitis","id":"37295250500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5536948","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"abstract":"This paper investigates the effect of time-domain (TD) and frequency-domain (FD) interpolation on the performance of a Multi-Band (MB) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) Ultra-Wideband (UWB) system.

For the specific application where the interpolation factor is fixed to four, the FD interpolator outperforms the TD interpolator implemented with digital low-pass FIR filters in terms of computational complexity. On the other hand simulation results show that FD implementation degrades the overall system performance for certain UWB channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05536948.pdf","startPage":"2143","endPage":"2146","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5536948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5536948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5536948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of time and frequency domain interpolation implementations for MB-OFDM UWB transmitters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency domain analysis","Interpolation","Transmitters","OFDM","Time domain analysis","Ultra wideband technology","Computer architecture","Finite impulse response filter","Computational complexity","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interpolation","OFDM modulation","radio transmitters","time-frequency analysis","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-frequency domain interpolation","MB-OFDM UWB transmitters","multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","ultra wideband system","UWB channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5536948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of time and frequency domain interpolation implementations for MB-OFDM UWB transmitters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5536948/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462729","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of time and frequency domain interpolation implementations for MB-OFDM UWB transmitters","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"05432685.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05115S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5536948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5536949,"authors":[{"name":"Kangwoo Park","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kangwoo","lastName":"Park","id":"37539842700"},{"name":"In-Cheol Park","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"In-Cheol","lastName":"Park","id":"37270580300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5536949","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":294},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","OFDM","Nonlinear distortion","Error analysis","Computational complexity","Degradation","Partial transmit sequences","High power amplifiers","Time domain analysis","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","iterative methods","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PAPR reduction","OFDM systems","peak to average power ratio","iterative computation","tone reservation method","DFT","radix-2 FFT"]}],"abstract":"The OFDM communication system has a serious drawback that the peak signal value can be much higher than the average signal value. High peak signals can be easily distorted by the nonlinearity of power amplifiers, and can increase the symbol error rate (SER) significantly. Though many techniques have been proposed to reduce the peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR), they are usually based on iterative FFT computation, needing lots of computation time. Based on the tone reservation method, this paper proposes a low complexity DFT structure in order to lower the complexity of PAPR reduction techniques. In the proposed method, several approximations are employed to reduce the computational complexity and to substitute complex multiplications with simple shift operations. The performance of the proposed tone reservation method is compared with that of the conventional method based on the radix-2 FFT. Simulation results show that there is almost no performance degradation if the radix-2 FFT is replaced with the proposed approximate DFT.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5536949","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05536949.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5536949","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","startPage":"2147","endPage":"2150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity tone reservation method for PAPR reduction of OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5536949","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity tone reservation method for PAPR reduction of OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5536949/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462730","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5536949/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity tone reservation method for PAPR reduction of OFDM systems","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"05442710.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053938S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5536949","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5536953,"authors":[{"name":"Siavash Saremi-Yarahmadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Siavash","lastName":"Saremi-Yarahmadi","id":"38275379800"},{"name":"Olive H.

Here, we describe a VLSI implementation of a current-mode conductance-based neuron, connected to synaptic circuits with spike-based learning capabilities. The conductance-based silicon neuron has built-in spike-frequency adaptation, refractory period mechanisms, and plasticity eligibility control circuits. The synaptic circuits exhibits realistic dynamics in the post-synaptic currents and comprise local spike-based learning circuits, controlled by the global post-synaptic eligibility circuits.

This paper presents the hardware and software infrastructure supporting the use of a family of floating-gate based FPAAs being developed at Georgia Tech. This infrastructure is compact and portable and provides the user with a comprehensive set of tools for custom analog circuit design and implementation. The infrastructure includes the FPAA IC, discrete ADC, DAC and amplifier ICs, a 32-Bit ARM based microcontroller for interfacing the FPAA with the user's computer, and Matlab and targeting software. The FPAA hardware communicates with Matlab over a USB connection. The USB connection also provides the hardware's power. The software tools include three major systems: a Matlab Simulink FPAA program, a SPICE to FPAA compiler called GRASPER, and a visualization tool called RAT. The hardware consists of two custom PCB designs which include a main board used to program and control an FPAA IC and an FPAA IC adaptor board used to interface a QFP packaged FPAA IC with the 100 pin ZIF socket on the main programming and control board.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05536992.pdf","startPage":"2794","endPage":"2797","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5536992","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5536992","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5536992","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware and software infrastructure for a family of floating-gate based FPAAs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Field programmable analog arrays","Analog circuits","Universal Serial Bus","Educational programs","Large-scale systems","Microcontrollers","Computer interfaces","Software tools","SPICE"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","analogue integrated circuits","analogue-digital conversion","digital-analogue conversion","electronics packaging","field programmable analogue arrays","hardware-software codesign","large-scale systems","mathematics computing","microcontrollers","printed circuit design","program compilers","reconfigurable architectures","SPICE","user interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware infrastructure","software infrastructure","floating gate based FPAAS","large scale field programmable analog array","Georgia Tech","analog circuit design","discrete ADC","discrete DAC","amplifier IC","32 bit ARM based microcontroller","Matlab","USB connection","hardware power","Matlab Simulink FPAA program","SPICE","FPAA compiler","GRASPER","visualization tool","RAT","PCB design","FPAA IC adaptor board","QFP packaged FPAA IC interface","100 pin ZIF socket","FPAA interface"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPAA","Simulink","Reconfigurable Analog"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5536992/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Hardware and software infrastructure for a family of floating-gate based FPAAs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5536992/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462808","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware and software infrastructure for a family of floating-gate based FPAAs","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"07132997.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053233S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5536992","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5537009,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Mayr","affiliation":["Institute of Circuits and Systems, Dresden University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Mayr","id":"37281936100"},{"name":"Marko Noack","affiliation":["Institute of Circuits and Systems, Dresden University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Marko","lastName":"Noack","id":"37536377800"},{"name":"Johannes Partzsch","affiliation":["Institute of Circuits and Systems, Dresden University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Partzsch","id":"37542698900"},{"name":"Ren\u00e9 Sch\u00fcffny","affiliation":["Institute of Circuits and Systems, Dresden University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Ren\u00e9","lastName":"Sch\u00fcffny","id":"37266953100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537009","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":351},"abstract":"The computational function of neural networks is thought to depend primarily on the learning/plasticity function carried out at the synapse. Neuromorphic circuit realizations have taken this into account by implementing a variety of synaptical processing functions, with most recent synapse circuits replicating some form of Spike Time Dependent Plasticity (STDP). However, STDP is being challenged by older rate-dependent learning rules as well as by biological experiments exhibiting more complex timing rules (e.g. spike triplets) as well as simultaneous rate- and timing dependent plasticity. In this paper, we present a circuit realization of a plasticity rule based on the postsynaptic neuron potential as well as the transmission profile of the presynaptic spike. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first circuit realization of synaptical behaviour which moves significantly beyond STDP, replicating the triplet experiments of Froemke and Dan, the combined timing and rate experiments of Sjoestroem et al., as well as conventional BCM behaviour.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Replicating experimental spike and rate based neural learning in CMOS","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537009","endPage":"108","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537009.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","startPage":"105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537009","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomembranes","Timing","Virtual manufacturing","CMOS technology","Neurons","Circuit simulation","Neuromorphics","Threshold voltage","Circuits and systems","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["experimental spike","neural learning","CMOS","computational function","neural networks","learning function","plasticity function","neuromorphic circuit realizations","synaptical processing functions","synapse circuits","spike time dependent plasticity","STDP","older rate-dependent learning rules","biological experiments","rate-dependent plasticity","plasticity rule","postsynaptic neuron potential","transmission profile","presynaptic spike","first circuit realization","synaptical behaviour","BCM behaviour"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Replicating experimental spike and rate based neural learning in CMOS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537009/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537009/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11462825","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Replicating experimental spike and rate based neural learning in CMOS","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00271915.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051993S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537009","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5537010,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering, State University of New York, Albany, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280460900"},{"name":"Tom T.

We also show that as more channels are used, more resources can be saved by using our proposed architecture.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537043","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537043.pdf","startPage":"2682","endPage":"2685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537043","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of the MIMO-OFDM physical layer using single FFT multiplexing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537043/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of the MIMO-OFDM physical layer using single FFT multiplexing","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537043/","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462898","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of the MIMO-OFDM physical layer using single FFT multiplexing","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"06792631.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060766S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5537045,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37530896200"},{"name":"Erdal Oruklu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, USA"],"firstName":"Erdal","lastName":"Oruklu","id":"37300225600"},{"name":"Jafar Saniie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, USA"],"firstName":"Jafar","lastName":"Saniie","id":"37300151000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537045","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":684},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537045","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memory architecture","Signal processing algorithms","Hardware","Pipelines","Read only memory","Synthetic aperture radar","Computer architecture","Field programmable gate arrays","Logic","Very large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","fast Fourier transforms","field programmable gate arrays","memory architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced memory architecture","CORDIC-based FFT","memory CORDIC-based architecture","radix size FFT","multibank memory structure","twiddle factors","FPGA hardware"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new pipelined, reduced memory CORDIC-based architecture is presented for any radix size FFT.

The regression tree is built by iteratively splitting dataset and selecting attributes into a hierarchical tree model. The sample size reduces sharply after few levels of data splitting causing unreliable attribute selection. In contrast, the forward stepwise regression analysis selects critical attributes all the way with the same set of data. Regression analysis is, however, not capable of splitting data into groups with different underlying models. In this research, we propose a sample-efficient regression tree (SERT) approach that combines the forward selection in regression analysis and regression tree methodologies. The proposed approach is shown to be able to fully utilize the dataset's degree of freedom and build piecewise linear model to capture the attribute effects. Case studies show that SERT is effective in discovering yield-loss causes during the yield ramp-up stage where the sample size available for analysis is relatively small.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Regression tree analysis","Regression analysis","Data mining","Semiconductor device manufacture","Decision trees","Machine learning","Production","Mechanical engineering","Information analysis","Argon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","electronic engineering computing","integrated circuit yield","piecewise linear techniques","regression analysis","semiconductor industry","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sample-efficient regression trees","SERT","semiconductor yield loss analysis","data mining tool","hierarchical tree model","data splitting","attribute selection","forward stepwise regression analysis","forward selection","piecewise linear model","yield ramp-up stage"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data mining","machine learning","regression analysis","regression tree analysis","variable selection","yield enhancement"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSM.2010.2048968","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel5/66/5536887/05537059.pdf","startPage":"358","endPage":"369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536887","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSM.2010.2048968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sample-Efficient Regression Trees (SERT) for Semiconductor Yield Loss Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537059","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sample-Efficient Regression Trees (SERT) for Semiconductor Yield Loss Analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537059/","volume":"23","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537059/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11453897","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 August 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sample-Efficient Regression Trees (SERT) for Semiconductor Yield Loss Analysis","sourcePdf":"tsm-achen-2048968-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067134S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"66","isNumber":"5536887","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5536887","articleId":"5537059","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5537061,"authors":[{"name":"Jose Sarmento","firstName":"Jose","lastName":"Sarmento","id":"37396118400"},{"name":"John T.

The software is hosted on a free-soft-core processor from Xilinx FPGA (PicoBlaze); while two novel arithmetic circuits serve as the hardware environment to perform multi-precision arithmetic and scalable reduction.

This paper focuses on choosing optimal Continuous Valued Number System (CVNS) neural networks, and shows using system-level analysis that how CVNS networks can be used to implement large size networks. The network is implemented using analog non-linear activation function with more precision, and provides more accuracy in comparison to analog networks. The CVNS computation system which is used as an alternative method of implementation, is analog in nature and employs digit-level analog modular arithmetic. The information redundancy among the digits can be used to increase the accuracy of the precision using analog circuitry with arbitrary accuracy. Moreover, the system configuration take advantage of distributed neuron properties. This type of neurons reduce overall network sensitivity to mismatches that are inherent in any neural networks implemented by analog circuitries. Moreover, to reduce the network complexity in terms of number of interconnections, a series configuration of multiplexer and demultiplexer is used. Weights are refreshed and refined as an overall approach to maintain the weights stored on chip, and are not used to compute network response. To study overall accuracy of the system, stochastic modeling of the network is carried out. The proposed network has comparable sensitivity to other CVNS Madaline, while reduces the network complexity in terms of reducing computing units and interconnections proportional by a factor proportional to the network nodes.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537102","startPage":"2578","endPage":"2581","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537102.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System-level design of low complexity CVNS feed forward neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537102/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"System-level design of low complexity CVNS feed forward neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537102/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11463037","publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System-level design of low complexity CVNS feed forward neural network","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"06533099.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04802S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537102","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5537108,"authors":[{"name":"Shingo Yoshizawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shingo","lastName":"Yoshizawa","id":"37270688500"},{"name":"Hirokazu Ikeuchi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hirokazu","lastName":"Ikeuchi","id":"37544833100"},{"name":"Yoshikazu Miyanaga","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshikazu","lastName":"Miyanaga","id":"37270680800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537108","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"abstract":"MIMO-OFDM performs signal detection on subcarrier-by-subcarrier basis and increases its computational complexity. A complete pipeline MMSE detector meeting requirements for a high throughput has been presented in our previous work, which provides real-time processing even for large numbers of subcarriers. However, it requires large circuit scale and tends to be excessive for small numbers of subcarriers. We propose a new scalable architecture to reduce circuit scale by adjusting the number of iterative operations related to OFDM parameters. The designed detector reduces to about 1/2 to 1/7 in circuit area and is superior to the conventional detectors in computation time.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537108.pdf","startPage":"2534","endPage":"2537","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable pipeline architecture of MMSE MIMO detector for 4\u00d74 MIMO-OFDM receiver","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Detectors","OFDM","Circuits","Throughput","Pipeline processing","Vectors","Computer architecture","Signal detection","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","receivers","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MMSE MIMO detector","scalable pipeline architecture","MIMO OFDM Receiver","signal detection","computational complexity","real time processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537108/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Scalable pipeline architecture of MMSE MIMO detector for 4\u00d74 MIMO-OFDM receiver","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537108/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11463043","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable pipeline architecture of MMSE MIMO detector for 4\u00d74 MIMO-OFDM receiver","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"06412436.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092828S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5537111,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Sun","affiliation":["Institut d'Electronique du Solide et des Syst\u00e8mes, UMR 7163 Joint Laboratory of University of Strasbourg/CNRS, France"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Sun","id":"37531906800"},{"name":"Francois Schwartz","affiliation":["Institut d'Electronique du Solide et des Syst\u00e8mes, UMR 7163 Joint Laboratory of University of Strasbourg/CNRS, France"],"firstName":"Francois","lastName":"Schwartz","id":"37542847100"},{"name":"Jacques Michel","affiliation":["Institut d'Electronique du Solide et des Syst\u00e8mes, UMR 7163 Joint Laboratory of University of Strasbourg/CNRS, France"],"firstName":"Jacques","lastName":"Michel","id":"37530957700"},{"name":"Yannick Herve","affiliation":["Institut d'Electronique du Solide et des Syst\u00e8mes, UMR 7163 Joint Laboratory of University of Strasbourg/CNRS, France"],"firstName":"Yannick","lastName":"Herve","id":"37298838800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537111","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Learning","Neural networks","Adaptive systems","Medical treatment","Cathode ray tubes","Delay","Artificial intelligence","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Heart beat"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cardiovascular system","delay estimation","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical signal processing","neural nets","pacemakers","real-time systems","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reinforcement learning algorithm","analog spiking neural network","adaptive cardiac resynchronization therapy device","biventricular pacemaker","cardiac delay prediction","CRT device","real time optimal heartbeat"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A reinforcement learning algorithm used in analog spiking neural network for an adaptive cardiac Resynchronization Therapy device","abstract":"The target of this research is to develop an analog spiking neural network in order to improve the performance of biventricular pacemakers, which is also known as Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) devices.

To increase the accuracy, the effects of the short channel lengths as well as the drain bias are included in the modeling. The statistical analytical modeling is achieved by taking the partial derivations of the transition time expression. To assess the accuracy of the technique, HSPICE Monte-Carlo simulations have been used for a 65nm CMOS technology. The comparison, which is performed for different correlation coefficients, shows a very good accuracy for the model which is evaluated at substantially lower runtime.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537134","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537134.pdf","startPage":"2502","endPage":"2505","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical delay modeling of read operation of SRAMs due to channel length variation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537134/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Statistical delay modeling of read operation of SRAMs due to channel length variation","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537134/","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11463113","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical delay modeling of read operation of SRAMs due to channel length variation","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"06332465.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105054S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5537137,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan-Hsin Liao","affiliation":["Graduated Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuan-Hsin","lastName":"Liao","id":"37532911100"},{"name":"Gwo-Long Li","affiliation":["Graduated Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Gwo-Long","lastName":"Li","id":"37292282500"},{"name":"Tian-Sheuan Chang","affiliation":["Graduated Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tian-Sheuan","lastName":"Chang","id":"37292028800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537137","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":222},"abstract":"A high throughput context-based adaptive binary arithmetic coding (CABAC) decoding design with hybrid memory architecture for H.264/AVC is presented in this paper.

The noise performance of DCSK/FM-DCSK is superior to most conventional modulation schemes in multipath-channel environment. Cooperative communication, on the other hand, is receiving increasing attention due to its efficiency in sharing single-antenna mobiles or network nodes with other antennas to achieve combating fading via transmitting diversity. By combining these two aspects of advantages, a novel chaotic communication system is proposed in this paper, aiming to achieve combating multipath and fading effects. Simulation results show that significant performance improvement can be achieved by the proposed system in comparison with non-cooperative systems. It is found that the choice of some key parameters, such as the spread spectrum factor and the relay selective strategy, affect the system performance prominently. It reveals that the combination of the DCSK/FM-DCSK framework with a cooperative strategy is of great practical value for certain wireless communication networks.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537139","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537139.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","startPage":"2454","endPage":"2457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and simulation of a cooperative communication system based on DCSK/FM-DCSK","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537139","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and simulation of a cooperative communication system based on DCSK/FM-DCSK","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537139/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11463118","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5537139/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and simulation of a cooperative communication system based on DCSK/FM-DCSK","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"06211349.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056765S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5537143,"authors":[{"name":"Heng-Ming Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Heng-Ming","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37271935300"},{"name":"Tai-Hsin Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tai-Hsin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37420371400"},{"name":"Jhao-Siang Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jhao-Siang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37407362800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537143","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":515},"abstract":"This paper proposes an inductive feedback technique implemented in the ultra-wide-band (UWB) low noise amplifier (LNA).

and electromigration in the nanocircuit can be solved. In the writing mode, the voltage of the memory cell ground line is increased to VDD/2 gradually, and the nMOSFET is turned off so that the memory cell ground line is set in a high-impedance state. Data can then be written easily by decreasing the voltage of one bit line adiabatically, while the voltage of the other bit line remains high. For reading, using the shared reading port, the voltage swing of the global bit-line can be decreased to VDD/4 so that the problems of electromigration can be solved. The reading method enables a gradual current flow in the memory cell. We designed the cell layout and confirmed that the number of transistors in the cell is quasi-six. In addition, two types of new step voltage circuits with tank capacitors are proposed. One is for producing the memory cell ground line voltage and the other for charging the word line voltage adiabatically.

The memristive devices presented here have the potential of a very high integration density, and they are suitable for hybrid CMOS co-fabrication with a CMOS-compatible process. We show that 2 different regimes are possible, making these devices suitable either for volatile ambipolar memory or resistive random access memory (RRAM) applications.

These sensors reduce redundancy and latency and increase dynamic range compared with conventional imagers. The digital sensor output is easily interfaced to conventional digital post processing, where it reduces the latency and cost of post processing compared to imagers. The asynchronous data could spawn a new area of DSP that breaks from conventional Nyquist rate signal processing. This paper reviews the rationale and history of this event-based approach, introduces sensor functionalities, and gives an overview of the papers in this session.

The accuracy and efficacy of the model are validated by comparisons with the maximum performance achieved from the distortion based prioritization.

The applicability of the method is verified by designing and analyzing a 2.4 GHz VCO using a 0.25 \u03bcm RF CMOS technology.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537252","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537252","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537252.pdf","startPage":"1324","endPage":"1327","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinearity and dynamics in RF Oscillators: Analysis and design implications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Nonlinearity and dynamics in RF Oscillators: Analysis and design implications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537252/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11463291","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5537252/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinearity and dynamics in RF Oscillators: Analysis and design implications","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"03322154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082754S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537252","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5537259,"authors":[{"name":"Jianan Song","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Jianan","lastName":"Song","id":"37535748200"},{"name":"David Welch","affiliation":["Bioengineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona 85287"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Welch","id":"37533133000"},{"name":"Jennifer Blain Christen","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Jennifer Blain","lastName":"Christen","id":"37298279700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537259","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":173},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microelectrodes","Cardiology","Circuit testing","Cells (biology)","Electrodes","Frequency","Gold","Transfer functions","Filtering","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","bioelectric potentials","biomedical electrodes","biomedical electronics","biomedical measurement","cardiology","cellular biophysics","differentiating circuits","microelectrodes","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplification circuit","HL-1 cardiomyocyte","4\u00d74 gold microelectrode array","Pogo pin jig","low frequency signal filtering","DC drift","action potential measurement","transfer function","differential circuits","gain 60 dB","gain 46 dB","Au"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537259","abstract":"We have designed and tested two amplification circuits for measuring HL-1 cardiac action potentials, single-ended and differential.

In addition we have designed and fabricated a 4\u00d74 gold microelectrode array and cultured HL-1 cells on the electrodes. The array is connected to our circuit through a custom made Pogo pin jig to allow for easy measurements from the electrodes while cells are being cultured. This setup allowed us to obtain initial results for modeling the transfer function of the cell culture as a passive device network. Testing has confirmed the circuits are capable of filtering low frequency signals including DC drift and frequencies above 5 kHz. The amplification was achieved through two gain stages with a total gain of 60 dB for the single-ended and 46 dB for the differential circuits.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537259","startPage":"1384","endPage":"1387","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537259.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplification circuit and microelectrode array for HL-1 Cardiomyocyte action potential measurement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Amplification circuit and microelectrode array for HL-1 Cardiomyocyte action potential measurement","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537259/","accessionNumber":"11494673","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537259/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplification circuit and microelectrode array for HL-1 Cardiomyocyte action potential measurement","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"03473134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042519S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5537262,"authors":[{"name":"Han-Yen Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Han-Yen","lastName":"Chang","id":"37539356800"},{"name":"Sheng-Chih Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Chin-Yi University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sheng-Chih","lastName":"Yang","id":"37537742300"},{"name":"Sheng-Hsing Lan","affiliation":["Department of Neurology Kaohsiung Medical, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sheng-Hsing","lastName":"Lan","id":"37543341600"},{"name":"Pau-Choo Chung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pau-Choo","lastName":"Chung","id":"37287692900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537262","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":281},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new scheme which combines two algorithms to detect epileptic seizure in the grouped multi-channel EEG signals. For the proposed scheme, a recent technique, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), is first adapted to separate blind sources and extract feature from grouped EEG signals. Then, Wavelet transform is followed for multi resolution and multi-level analysis on those primary signals extracted by ICA. Finally, a threshold method based on wavelet transform again is applied to detect the epileptic seizure. A series of experiments using different method combination are conducted and the experimental results show that the proposed method has a superior quality.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of

Nevertheless, at the nominal operation condition where the modulation index M=0.1, the power-efficiency is typically 32%. In this paper, we show that the comparator embodied in the over-current protection circuit of the Class D output stage is dominant at M=0.1. We propose the design of a novel comparator (with performance parameters comparable with conventional comparators) featuring ~40% lower power dissipation. This improved lower power dissipation translates to a worthwhile 12% improvement in the power-efficiency of the Class D amplifier output stage. The proposed design herein is verified by computer simulations.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537278","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537278.pdf","startPage":"1248","endPage":"1251","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A micropower comparator for high power-efficiency hearing aid class D amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"A micropower comparator for high power-efficiency hearing aid class D amplifiers","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5537278/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11463355","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537278/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A micropower comparator for high power-efficiency hearing aid class D amplifiers","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"03132934.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053561S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537278","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5537279,"authors":[{"name":"Omid Rajaee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Omid","lastName":"Rajaee","id":"37393280200"},{"name":"Yue Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Hu","id":"37535760700"},{"name":"Manideep Gande","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Manideep","lastName":"Gande","id":"38493858800"},{"name":"Tawfiq Musah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Tawfiq","lastName":"Musah","id":"37393281000"},{"name":"Un-Ku Moon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Un-Ku","lastName":"Moon","id":"37276672400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537279","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1006},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537279","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Voltage","Capacitors","Feedback","Power amplifiers","Thermal factors","Additive noise","Moon","Thermal degradation","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["operational amplifiers","switched capacitor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interstage correlated double sampling technique","switched capacitor gain stages","thermal noise penalty","feedback factor degradation","CDS technique","two-stage amplifier"]}],"abstract":"An Interstage Correlated Double Sampling technique is proposed.

These vision sensors capture dynamical discontinuities on-chip for a reduced data volume compared to that from intensity images. Therefore, they support detection, segmentation and tracking of moving objects in the Address-Event space by exploiting the generated events, as a reaction to intensity changes, resulting from the scene dynamics. Object tracking has been previously demonstrated and reported in scientific publications using monocular dynamic vision sensors. This paper contributes with presenting and demonstrating a tracking algorithm using the 3D sensing technology based on the stereo dynamic vision sensor. This system is capable of detecting and tracking persons within a 4m range at an effective refresh rate of the depth map of up to 200 per second. The 3D system is evaluated for people tracking and the tests showed that up to 60k Address-Events/s can be processed for real-time tracking.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537289","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537289.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","startPage":"1409","endPage":"1412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic stereo vision system for real-time tracking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537289","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic stereo vision system for real-time tracking","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537289/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11463364","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5537289/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic stereo vision system for real-time tracking","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"03571003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050839S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5537291,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Rieger","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Rieger","id":"37272222000"},{"name":"Yan-Ru Huang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yan-Ru","lastName":"Huang","id":"37536910500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537291","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":700},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Low-noise amplifiers","CMOS technology","Bipolar transistors","Differential amplifiers","Capacitors","Voltage","Transconductors","Electromyography","Circuit noise","Switching circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bipolar transistors","CMOS integrated circuits","low noise amplifiers","medical signal processing","recording","switched capacitor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low noise CMOS amplifier","bio potential recording","programmable biopotential acquisition system","electroneurogram","electromyogram","bipolar transistor","switched capacitor transresistance","biomedical signal recording","size 0.35 mum"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537291","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537291.pdf","startPage":"1220","endPage":"1223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high-gain, low-noise CMOS amplifier for sampled bio-potential recording","abstract":"There is a growing demand for low-noise, small-size and programmable biopotential acquisition systems.

By using David Cells as the central technique in the delay insensitive clock replacement, this method is conducive to the establishment of an automatic design and synthesis flow.

To relax such sampling burden, this paper develops a novel sub-sampling distributed video coding (SuDVC) by utilizing compressive sensing (CS) technique. Due to the inherent sparsity in video sources, the video frames are compressively sampled at the encoder. On the other hand, by exploiting the correlation between CS measurements and side information and by performing sparsity recovery, the video frames are recovered at the decoder. When compared with the traditional fully-sampling equivalence, SuDVC enjoys the reduction of transmission rate, the reduction of implementation complexity and the robustness to channel losses, which are verified in the simulations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video coding","Video compression","Decoding","Image sampling","Costs","Image coding","Robustness","Propagation losses","Discrete cosine transforms","Helium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codecs","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subsampling framework","distributed video coding","DVC","compressive sensing technique","transmission rate","channel losses","sparsity recovery","decoder"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537317","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537317.pdf","startPage":"1145","endPage":"1148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sub-Sampling Framework of Distributed Video Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537317","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sub-Sampling Framework of Distributed Video Coding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537317/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537317/","accessionNumber":"11463454","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sub-Sampling Framework of Distributed Video Coding","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"02871916.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049907S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5537332,"authors":[{"name":"Paul T.

These polar transmitters use envelope modulators based on digital-to-analog converters (DACs) as power amplifiers. Such an approach is very useful when the maximum theoretical efficiency of the power-amplifier digital-to-analog converter (PA-DAC) is comparable or better than state-of-the-art architectures. This architecture has the advantage that the phase-modulated input signal can drive the circuit in class-A or class-B, without causing any distortion in the overall signal path. Only at the combination point of the phase-modulated signal and the envelope modulated signal, the distortion in the combined signal becomes important. Here, a calculation of the efficiency for such a PA-DAC is performed for both class-A and class-B using WLAN Orthogonal-Frequency-Division-Multiplex (OFDM) signals. When driving the phase-modulated input of the envelope PA-DAC in class-A, an efficiency of 28% can be reached for a peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAR) of 6 dB, while 20% can be reached for a PAR of 9 dB. Similarly, when driving the phase-modulated input of the PA-DAC in class-B, an efficiency of 44% can be reached for a PAR of 6 dB, while 31% can be reached for a PAR of 9 dB.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537332.pdf","startPage":"1105","endPage":"1108","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The theoretical efficiency in digital envelope power amplifiers for WLAN OFDM polar transmitters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Wireless LAN","Transmitters","Peak to average power ratio","OFDM modulation","Digital-analog conversion","Phase distortion","Bluetooth","Digital modulation","Drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bluetooth","digital-analogue conversion","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers","radio transmitters","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital envelope power amplifiers","WLAN","OFDM","polar transmitters","wireless-local-area-network","Bluetooth signals","digital-to-analog converters","phase-modulated signal","peak- to-average-power-ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537332/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"The theoretical efficiency in digital envelope power amplifiers for WLAN OFDM polar transmitters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537332/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11463469","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The theoretical efficiency in digital envelope power amplifiers for WLAN OFDM polar transmitters","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"02771473.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062822S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537332","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5537337,"authors":[{"name":"YoungJoo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"YoungJoo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37539806200"},{"name":"In-Cheol Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"In-Cheol","lastName":"Park","id":"37270580300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537337","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":823},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Analog-digital conversion","Energy consumption","Capacitance","Linearity","Error correction","Switches","Voltage control","Analytical models","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","energy consumption","switched capacitor filters","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitor array structure","switching control scheme","capacitor mismatch effects","SAR analog-to-digital converters","junction-splitting method","energy consumption"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new capacitor array structure developed for SAR analog-to-digital converters and its switching algorithm that can alleviate capacitor mismatch effects.

Simulation results show that the proposed method significantly reduces the number of missing codes caused by the capacitance mismatch, and reduces the energy consumption by more than 70% compared to the conventional charge redistribution method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacitor array structure and switching control scheme to reduce capacitor mismatch effects for SAR analog-to-digital converters","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537337","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537337.pdf","startPage":"1464","endPage":"1467","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537337","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537337/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Capacitor array structure and switching control scheme to reduce capacitor mismatch effects for SAR analog-to-digital converters","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537337/","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11463474","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacitor array structure and switching control scheme to reduce capacitor mismatch effects for SAR analog-to-digital converters","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"03733078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047046S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5537349,"authors":[{"name":"Matthias Blesken","affiliation":["System and Circuit Technology, University of Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Blesken","id":"37543279100"},{"name":"Sven L\u00fctkemeier","affiliation":["System and Circuit Technology, University of Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Sven","lastName":"L\u00fctkemeier","id":"37543277200"},{"name":"Ulrich R\u00fcckert","affiliation":["Cognitronic and Sensor Systems University of Bielefeld, Germany"],"firstName":"Ulrich","lastName":"R\u00fcckert","id":"37267463400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537349","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":691},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS logic circuits","Power systems","Robustness","Energy consumption","Propagation delay","Design optimization","Process design","Algorithm design and analysis","CMOS process","Logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS logic circuits","logic gates","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective optimization problem","transistor sizing","subthreshold CMOS logic standard cells","digital ultralow power systems","MOP algorithm","design process","inverter","NAND gate","NOR gate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiobjective optimzation","CMOS logic gates","sub-threshold standard cells"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537349","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537349.pdf","startPage":"1480","endPage":"1483","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537349","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective optimization for transistor sizing sub-threshold CMOS logic standard cells","abstract":"Transistor sizing of sub-threshold standard cells for digital ultra-low power systems is a very challenging task because robustness has to be considered as an important design objective in addition to the competing resources power consumption and propagation delay.

A real-value decomposed MIMO system model is handled and thus the channel matrix to be processed is extended to the size 8\u00d78. Instead of direct factorization, we propose a QR decomposition scheme by cascading one complex-value and one real-value Givens rotation blocks, which can save 44% hardware complexity. The systolic array is adopted for hardware implementation to facilitate pipeline design. Then, the requirement of skewed inputs to the conventional complex-value QR-decomposition systolic array is improved and 37% of delay elements are removed. The real-value Givens rotation stage is implemented by a stacked triangular systolic array to match with the throughput of the complex-value one. We have implemented the proposed design in 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS technology with 152K gates. From post-layout simulations, the maximum operating frequency can achieve 90.09MHz. The proposed scheme not only reduces the hardware complexity, but also supports high throughput for MIMO-OFDM signal detection up to 2.16 Gbps under stationary channels.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537358","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537358.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","startPage":"1492","endPage":"1495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-throughput QR decomposition for MIMO detection in OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537358","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-throughput QR decomposition for MIMO detection in OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537358/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462539","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5537358/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-throughput QR decomposition for MIMO detection in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"03802223.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092102S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537358","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5537359,"authors":[{"name":"Sanghoon Park","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sanghoon","lastName":"Park","id":"37067893500"},{"name":"Vincent W.

This analysis is of interest in the context of energy constrained short range communication where low power, low cost and small size are key requirements (e.g. standard IEEE 802.15.4). In fact, the transmit power in such applications become smaller and reaches values in the order of the conversion or the processing power. Using an appropriate information-theoretic framework we show that the analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for short range communication should be low-resolution, in order to reduce the overall power consumption. In addition we derive the optimal operating bit-resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as function of the path-loss (i.e. the communication distance).","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537362","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537362.pdf","startPage":"1025","endPage":"1028","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How to choose the ADC resolution for short range low power communication?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537362","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537362/","displayDocTitle":"How to choose the ADC resolution for short range low power communication?","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462543","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537362/","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How to choose the ADC resolution for short range low power communication?","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"02571940.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03546S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537362","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5537363,"authors":[{"name":"Minwei Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Minwei","lastName":"Lu","id":"37535287600"},{"name":"Naresh Shanbhag","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Naresh","lastName":"Shanbhag","id":"37273973400"},{"name":"Andrew Singer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Singer","id":"37271395100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537363","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":530},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analog-digital conversion","Bit error rate","Intersymbol interference","Quantization","Communication channels","Table lookup","Equalizers","CMOS process","Transmitters","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","CMOS digital integrated circuits","equalisers","error statistics","intersymbol interference","telecommunication channels","telecommunication links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BER-optimal analog-to-digital converters","communication links","ADC","quantization levels","bit error rate minimization","transparent waveform preservers","communication channels","intersymbol interference","ISI","flash converters","look-up table-based equalizers","CMOS process","size 45 nm"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose BER-optimal analog-to-digital converters (ADC) where quantization levels and thresholds are set non-uniformly to minimize the bit-error rate (BER). This is in contrast to present-day ADCs which act as transparent waveform preservers. Simulations for various communication channels show that the BER-optimal ADC achieves shaping gains that range from 2.5dB for channels with low intersymbol interference (ISI) to more than 30dB for channels with high ISI. Moreover, a 3-bit BER-optimal ADC achieves the same or even lower BER than a 4-bit uniform ADC. For flash converters, this corresponds a power reduction by 2\u00d7. Look-up table based equalizers compatible with BER-optimal ADCs are shown to reduce the power up to 47% and the area up to 66% in a 45nm CMOS process. The shaping gain due to BER-optimal ADCs can be exploited to lower peak transmit swings at the transmitter or decrease power consumption of the ADC.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER-optimal analog-to-digital converters for communication links","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537363","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537363.pdf","startPage":"1029","endPage":"1032","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537363","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537363/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"BER-optimal analog-to-digital converters for communication links","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537363/","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462544","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER-optimal analog-to-digital converters for communication links","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"02582949.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067835S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5537367,"authors":[{"name":"Serkan Say\u0131l\u0131r","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Serkan","lastName":"Say\u0131l\u0131r","id":"37542009200"},{"name":"Yung-Hsiang Lu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Yung-Hsiang","lastName":"Lu","id":"37280555000"},{"name":"Dimitrios Peroulis","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Peroulis","id":"37275343300"},{"name":"Y.

The sorting of spikes depends on the features extracted from the neural waveforms, and a better sorting performance usually comes with a higher sampling rate (SR). However the long duration experiment on free-moving subjects is the current trend. For low power considerations, the compromise on sorting accuracy is made for the miniaturized and wireless neural recording ICs with a lower SR. In this paper, we introduce the cubic spline interpolation to strike the power and accuracy tradeoff on the recording microsystems for the off-site and on-chip spike sorter. According to the simulation results, the recorder operated with the SR of 12.5k sample per second (sps) outperforms the system with 25ksps SR on both accuracy and power if the interpolation is appropriately performed before the spike sorting.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537370.pdf","startPage":"1508","endPage":"1511","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accuracy and power tradeoff in spike sorting microsystems with cubic spline interpolation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sorting","Spline","Interpolation","Sampling methods","Neurons","Strontium","Feature extraction","Neural prosthesis","Circuits","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interpolation","micromechanical devices","splines (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power tradeoff","spike sorting microsystems","cubic spline interpolation","neuroscientific applications","neuroprosthetic applications","sampling rate","free-moving subjects","wireless neural recording IC","miniaturized IC","off-site spike sorter","on-chip spike sorter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537370/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Accuracy and power tradeoff in spike sorting microsystems with cubic spline interpolation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537370/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462551","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accuracy and power tradeoff in spike sorting microsystems with cubic spline interpolation","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"03842060.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049727S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5537379,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In 3-D ICs, one of the key challenges is the vertical technology, using through-silicon via (TSV) for different device layers connection. In this paper, by noticing the TSV assignment comes under the influence of the whitespace distribution in a given 3-D floorplan, we proposed an algorithm called whitespace insertion (WSI) based on the floorplan-representation Sequence Pair to make the whitespace distribution in the given floorplan more reasonable for TSV insertion. When given 3-D circuit placement or floorplan results, we also proposed a minimum spanning tree based algorithm for TSV assignment to minimize the total wire length, assuming each net may have at most one TSV on each device layer. Experimental results show that, in the given 3-D floorplans there is a huge gap about 45.54% of the wire length increase between the ideal and the practice. And based on our method, the total wire length can be reduced by 13% on average without changing the chip area.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537404","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537404.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","startPage":"913","endPage":"916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Whitespace insertion for through-silicon via planning on 3-D SoCs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537404","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Whitespace insertion for through-silicon via planning on 3-D SoCs","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537404/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462623","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5537404/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Whitespace insertion for through-silicon via planning on 3-D SoCs","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"02291881.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046037S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537404","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5537406,"authors":[{"name":"Hoi-Kok Cheung","affiliation":["Centre of Multimedia Signal Processing Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Hoi-Kok","lastName":"Cheung","id":"37290020400"},{"name":"Wan-Chi Siu","affiliation":["Centre of Multimedia Signal Processing Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Wan-Chi","lastName":"Siu","id":"37270783500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537406","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":244},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537406","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prediction methods","Solid modeling","Quality management","Decoding","Motion compensation","Motion estimation","Costs","Video sequences","MPEG 4 Standard","Multimedia systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","motion compensation","motion estimation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local affine motion prediction","H.264 compression","coding system","motion estimation","motion compensation","image quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["motion vectors","affine prediction","motion compensation","affine motion"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537406","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537406.pdf","startPage":"1555","endPage":"1558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local affine motion prediction for H.264 without extra overhead","abstract":"Conventional coding system using translation only motion estimation and compensation system cannot efficiently handle complex inter-frame motion activity including scaling, rotation and various forms of distortion.

In this paper, we expose, from a more theoretical viewpoint, the factors that determine the prediction efficiency of TMP. It is shown that the motion estimate found by template matching tends to be the motion associated with the template centroid and that TMP consistently outperforms SKIP prediction, but hardly competes with block motion compensation (BMC) unless both the motion and intensity fields are less random or have high spatial correlation. We also demonstrate how template and block motion estimates can jointly be applied in a parametric overlapped block motion compensation (OBMC) framework to further improve temporal prediction. Preliminary results show that combining TMP with OBMC can yield 2-16% reductions in mean-square prediction error, as compared with the single use of OBMC. The gain is even higher (18%) when the performance is compared with that of the standard BMC.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of template matching prediction and its application to parametric overlapped block motion compensation","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537412","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537412.pdf","startPage":"1563","endPage":"1566","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537412","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537412/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of template matching prediction and its application to parametric overlapped block motion compensation","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537412/","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462631","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of template matching prediction and its application to parametric overlapped block motion compensation","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"03982702.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053276S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5537418,"authors":[{"name":"Adnan Harb","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, United Arab Emirates University, Al-Ain, UAE"],"firstName":"Adnan","lastName":"Harb","id":"37271619100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537418","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":634},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537418","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Rectifiers","Differential amplifiers","Rail to rail amplifiers","CMOS technology","Capacitors","Energy consumption","Circuit simulation","Medical simulation","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","differential amplifiers","harmonic distortion","rectifiers","sample and hold circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rail-to-rail full clock fully differential rectifier","sample-and-hold amplifier","class AB fully differential two stage amplifier","Miller compensation capacitor","offset cancellation","common mode control","CMOS technology","power consumption","total harmonic distortion","rectification","analog-to-digital converter","size 0.35 mum","power 3 mW","voltage 1.25 V","voltage -1.25 V","voltage 2.4 V","voltage -2.4 V"]}],"abstract":"An almost rail-to-rail full clock fully differential rectifier and sample-and-hold amplifier is presented.

FPGAs are widely used due to the fast time-to-market and reduced non-recurring engineering costs in comparison to ASIC designs. Interconnections play a crucial role in modern FPGAs, because they dominate delay, power and area. The use of multiple-valued logic allows the reduction of the number of signals in the circuit, hence providing a mean to effectively curtail the impact of interconnections. The most important characteristic of the results are the reduced fanout, fewer number of wires and the smaller wire length presented by the quaternary devices.

The proposed method combines the advantage of approximating the thermal properties of the chip as a linear system with the ease of fully parallel analog implementation of NNs. We perform a case study with the Niagara UltraSPARC T1 MPSoC for real-life applications, benchmarking our results with an accurate higher order Runge-Kutta (RK4) solver, that is employed in tools such as HotSpot. Within a few gate delays, the proposed NN design can simulate temperatures of the MPSoC 500 ms into the future - corresponding to thousands of iterations of the RK4 solver, with a maximum error of 1-2 K.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537439","startPage":"1599","endPage":"1602","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537439.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based on-chip thermal simulator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537439/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural network based on-chip thermal simulator","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537439/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11462657","publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based on-chip thermal simulator","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"04072827.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075945S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537439","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5537443,"authors":[{"name":"Srinivas Yerramalli","affiliation":["University of Southern California, USA"],"firstName":"Srinivas","lastName":"Yerramalli","id":"37400050100"},{"name":"Urbashi Mitra","affiliation":["University of Southern California, USA"],"firstName":"Urbashi","lastName":"Mitra","id":"37269542000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537443","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537443","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parameter estimation","Underwater acoustics","Doppler shift","Filtering","Wideband","Interference","OFDM","Signal processing","Statistics","Matched filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","intercarrier interference","OFDM modulation","parameter estimation","signal sampling","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind resampling parameter estimation","doubly selective underwater acoustic channels","intercarrier interference","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","matched filtering interpretation","Doppler scaling estimator"]}],"abstract":"Underwater acoustic channels are well modeled by different Doppler scaling per path, a generalization of the commonly employed model with equal Doppler scaling on all paths. The path dependent Doppler shifts and wideband channel, destroy carrier orthogonality and yield severe inter-carrier interference in an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing system. Resampling is typical front-end processing for signals over a common Doppler shift channel and this work examines the choice of resampling factor for the distinct Doppler per path scenario. Two criteria are derived to evaluate the optimal resampling parameter, one using sufficient statistics and the second using a matched filtering interpretation of resampling. The filtering interpretation is then used to derive a blind estimator for the optimal resampling parameter. Simulation results show the for small to moderate Doppler spreads, the blind estimator significantly outperforms the classical packet length based Doppler scaling estimator in many operating regimes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537443","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537443.pdf","startPage":"809","endPage":"812","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537443","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind resampling parameter estimation for doubly selective underwater acoustic channels (Invited Paper)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Blind resampling parameter estimation for doubly selective underwater acoustic channels (Invited Paper)","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5537443/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462661","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537443/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind resampling parameter estimation for doubly selective underwater acoustic channels (Invited Paper)","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"02033258.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041716S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537443","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5537445,"authors":[{"name":"Taizo Suzuki","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Taizo","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"37534698000"},{"name":"Masaaki Ikehara","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaaki","lastName":"Ikehara","id":"37268595300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537445","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Image coding","Transform coding","Discrete transforms","Pulse modulation","Modulation coding","Internet","Two dimensional displays","Costs","Lattices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","Hadamard transforms","image coding","Walsh functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["structurally regular integer discrete cosine transform","low-bit-word-length coefficient","IntDCT","dyadic value","lossless-to-lossy image coding","M-channel lossless WHT","Walsh-Hadamard transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IntDCT","dyadic values","low-blt-word-length","LWHT","lossless-to-lossy image coding"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an IntDCT with only dyadic values such as k/2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</sup>\n (k, n \u2208 N).

It is well-known in the literature that this formula is very useful to develop a block-based recursive least-squares algorithm for the block-based recursive identification of linear systems or the design of adaptive filters. We already extended this result to the case when the matrix A is singular, and presented the matrix pseudo-inversion lemma. Such a singular case may occur in a situation where a given problem is overdetermined in the sense that it has more equations than unknowns. In this paper, based on these results, we propose a block-based adaptive multichannel super-exponential deflation algorithm. We present simulation results for the performance of the block-based algorithm in order to show the usefulness of the matrix pseudo-inversion lemma.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537446","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537446.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","startPage":"801","endPage":"804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A block-based adaptive super-exponential deflation algorithm for blind deconvolution of MIMO systems using the matrix pseudo-inversion lemma","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537446","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A block-based adaptive super-exponential deflation algorithm for blind deconvolution of MIMO systems using the matrix pseudo-inversion lemma","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537446/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462664","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5537446/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A block-based adaptive super-exponential deflation algorithm for blind deconvolution of MIMO systems using the matrix pseudo-inversion lemma","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"02013252.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047962S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5537447,"authors":[{"name":"Xianfeng Xu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xianfeng","lastName":"Xu","id":"37535232900"},{"name":"Da-Zheng Feng","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Da-Zheng","lastName":"Feng","id":"37275288300"},{"name":"Wei Xing Zheng","affiliation":["School of Computing and Mathematics, University of Western Ontario, Penrith South, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Wei Xing","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37288601200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537447","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"abstract":"This paper is concerned with blind separation of convolutive sources. The main idea is to make an explicit exploitation of block Toeplitz structure and block-inner diagonal structure in autocorrelation matrices of source signals at different time delays as well as of inherent relations among these matrices. With implementation of joint block diagonalization, a tri-quadratic cost function is introduced so that the mixture matrix can be extracted from a set of the correlation matrices of the observed vector sequence without pre-whitening. In this novel one-stage algorithm, every iteration step involves finding the closed solution to the corresponding least squares problem. Once the estimate of the mixing matrix is obtained, the source signals are retrieved by the classical least squares methods. The performance of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by simulation results.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537447.pdf","startPage":"805","endPage":"808","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A joint block diagonalization approach to convolutive blind source separation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind source separation","Signal processing algorithms","Source separation","Iterative algorithms","Autocorrelation","Time domain analysis","Australia","Delay effects","Least squares methods","Higher order statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","convolution","least squares approximations","Toeplitz matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint block diagonalization approach","convolutive blind source signal separation","Toeplitz structure","block inner diagonal structure","autocorrelation matrices","tri-quadratic cost function","mixture matrix","correlation matrices","vector sequence","least squares method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537447/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"A joint block diagonalization approach to convolutive blind source separation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537447/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462665","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A joint block diagonalization approach to convolutive blind source separation","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"02023256.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050678S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5537449,"authors":[{"name":"Ju-Ya Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ju-Ya","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293034000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537449","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","OFDM","Probability density function","AWGN","Bandwidth","Phase estimation","Multipath channels","Wireless communication","Additive white noise","Digital video broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","frequency estimation","mean square error methods","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind carrier frequency offset estimation","OFDM systems","probability density function","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","CFO estimator","additive white Gaussian noise","multipath channels","mean square error estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","carrier frequency offset estimation"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a technique widely used for wireless communication applications. All the subcarriers are orthogonal to each other in OFDM systems. However, carrier frequency offset (CFO) may distort the orthogonality of the subcarriers and it must be estimated and compensated to maintain the system performance. A blind carrier frequency offset estimator based on the phase probability density function (pdf) is proposed in this paper. The proposed CFO estimator can operate under additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and multipath channels without known training signal, virtual carrier, and redundant guard interval. When compared with subspace-based blind estimators, the proposed estimator can provide better mean-squared-error performance.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537449","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537449.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","startPage":"793","endPage":"796","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind carrier frequency offset estimation for OFDM systems by probability density function","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537449","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Blind carrier frequency offset estimation for OFDM systems by probability density function","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537449/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462666","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5537449/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind carrier frequency offset estimation for OFDM systems by probability density function","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"01991872.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059441S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537449","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5537451,"authors":[{"name":"Marwan A.

The FFT computation requires an indexing scheme at each stage to address input/output data and coefficient multipliers properly. Most of these indexing schemes are based on bit-reversal techniques that are boosted by a look-up table requiring extra memory storage. This paper describes a novel data reordering technique based on the vector calculation of size r. FFTs are considered in-place (or in situ) algorithms that transform a data structure by using a constant amount of memory storage. We demonstrate that our proposed method reduces memory usage by eliminating the look-up table traditionally employed in the computation of bit-reversal indexes.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537451.pdf","startPage":"1615","endPage":"1618","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel approach for FFT data reordering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing","Signal processing algorithms","Discrete Fourier transforms","Fourier transforms","Indexing","Table lookup","Flexible printed circuits","Read-write memory","Control systems","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","frequency-domain analysis","signal processing","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FFT","fast Fourier transform","signal processing","frequency domain analysis","indexing schemes","bit-reversal techniques","look-up table","data reordering technique","vector calculation","in-place algorithms","memory storage"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537451/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"A novel approach for FFT data reordering","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537451/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462668","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel approach for FFT data reordering","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"04111769.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043635S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537451","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5537452,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Calimera","affiliation":["Politecnico di Turino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Calimera","id":"37391631800"},{"name":"Enrico Macii","affiliation":["Politecnico di Turino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Macii","id":"37267985100"},{"name":"Massimo Poncino","affiliation":["Politecnico di Turino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Poncino","id":"37274445600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537452","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":499},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","Random access memory","Niobium compounds","Titanium compounds","Aging","Threshold voltage","Stress","Delay effects","CMOS technology","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nanoelectronics","semiconductor device reliability","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NBTI-induced SNM degradation","power-gated SRAM cells","temporal reliability degradation mechanism","SRAM aging quantification","signal-to-noise margin","SNM degradation","industrial technology","memory cell","bit control techniques","negative bias temperature instability","size 45 nm"]}],"abstract":"Temporal reliability degradation mechanism, and NBTI in particular, are especially critical for SRAM cells. In fact, unlike logic gates, which under some conditions can be forced into an NBTI-immune state, SRAM cells are always subject to aging, whatever value they are storing.

The output of the current reference is a gate voltage which produces a desired current. For each daisy-chained bias, 32 bits of configuration are divided into 22 bits of bias current, 6 bits of active-mirror buffer current, and 4 bits of other configuration. Configuration of each bias allows specifying the type of transistor (nfet or pfet), whether the bias is enabled or weakly pulled to the rail, whether the bias is for a cascode, and whether the bias transistor uses a shifted source (SS) voltage for sub-off-current biasing. In addition, the current reference integrates a pair of voltage regulators that generate stable voltage sources near the rails, suitable for the SS current references. Measurements from fabricated current references built in 180 nm CMOS show that the reference achieves at least 110 dB (22-bit) dynamic range and reaches 160dB when power-rail gate biasing is included.

Graph-based approach, that maps the RL problem to a graph, is one of the several approaches proposed to identify the skills to learn automatically.

Experimental results show a 50%~60% saving of bandwidth on 720p and 1080p sequences, which indicates that the proposed scheme can be useful in reducing the system power through saving DRAM bandwidth.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537495/","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11463403","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5537495/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A lossless frame recompression scheme for reducing DRAM power in video encoding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A lossless frame recompression scheme for reducing DRAM power in video encoding","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"01701062.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055598S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537495","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5537497,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Chen Chen","affiliation":["Graduated Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Chen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37539679100"},{"name":"Gwo-Long Li","affiliation":["Graduated Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Gwo-Long","lastName":"Li","id":"37292282500"},{"name":"Tian-Sheuan Chang","affiliation":["Graduated Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tian-Sheuan","lastName":"Chang","id":"37292028800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537497","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Scalability","Automatic voltage control","Spatial resolution","Electronic switching systems","Static VAr compensators","Filters","Video coding","Video sequences","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image resolution","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inter-layer prediction hardware design","extended spatial scalability","H.264/AVC scalable extension","arbitrary frame resolution ratio","successive spatial layers","scalable video coding","hardware efficient inter-layer prediction architecture design","accumulator approach","inter-layer interpolator architecture","simplified transform block identification scheme"]}],"abstract":"To support inter-layer prediction with arbitrary frame resolution ratio between successive spatial layers, the scalable video coding (SVC) adopts the mechanism of extended spatial scalability (ESS) to achieve it but with noticeable hardware implementation complexity due to the numerous multiplication operations. Therefore, this paper proposes a hardware efficient inter-layer prediction architecture design with ESS by means of accumulator approach.

By relying on an existing scheme for the detection of double JPEG compressed images with desynchronized grids, we propose two algorithms for the detection of image regions that have been transplanted from another image. The proposed methods work whenever the pasted region is extracted from a JPEG compressed image and inserted in a target image that is subsequently compressed with a quality factor larger than that used to compress the source image. The new methods are intended as a complement to previous works relying on the detection of artifacts introduced by double JPEG compression with aligned compression grids. The experiments we carried out show the good performance of the novel schemes, the second one providing better results at a lower complexity thanks to the incorporation within the detection process of some information regarding the actual image content.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537505","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537505.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537505","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","startPage":"1687","endPage":"1690","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of cut & paste tampering by means of double-JPEG detection and image segmentation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537505","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Identification of cut & paste tampering by means of double-JPEG detection and image segmentation","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537505/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11463413","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5537505/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of cut & paste tampering by means of double-JPEG detection and image segmentation","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"04293296.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044883S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537505","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5537509,"authors":[{"name":"Yu M.

The same share is used at these varying resolutions in order to recover a large amount of hidden secrets. This process is quite similar to watermarking an image, whereby nothing can be seen while fully zoomed out, but as the zoom level is increased the watermark becomes visible.

A cyclic-line-access computation scheme has enabled seamless directional edge filtering in the row-parallel manner. The global thresholding algorithm adaptively determines the threshold value by taking the entire intensity distribution in the image into account and allows us to extract more significant features from input images autonomously. An analog proof-of-concept chip for four-directional edge detection was designed and fabricated in a 0.18-\u03bcm single-poly 5-metal CMOS technology. This chip carries out four-directional edge filtering by taking the convolution of 5\u00d75-or 5\u00d77-pixel kernels, and determines whether the edge exists or not by global thresholding. The concept has been experimentally verified by the measurement of fabricated chips.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537512","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537512.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","startPage":"625","endPage":"628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A row-parallel cyclic-line-access edge detection CMOS image sensor employing global thresholding operation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537512","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A row-parallel cyclic-line-access edge detection CMOS image sensor employing global thresholding operation","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537512/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11463484","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5537512/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A row-parallel cyclic-line-access edge detection CMOS image sensor employing global thresholding operation","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"01572314.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038999S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5537513,"authors":[{"name":"Viktor Gruev","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, Washington University of Saint Louis, Saint Louis, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Viktor","lastName":"Gruev","id":"37269503900"},{"name":"Rob Perkins","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, Washington University of Saint Louis, Saint Louis, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Rob","lastName":"Perkins","id":"37533514100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537513","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":430},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Charge-coupled image sensors","Aluminum","Optical polarization","Optical filters","Image sensors","Charge coupled devices","Optical imaging","Optical arrays","Sensor arrays","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CCD image sensors","image representation","nanowires","optical filters","polarisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CCD image sensor","aluminum nanowire polarization filter","monolithically integrating aluminum nanowire optical filters CCD imaging array","CCD polarization image sensor","raw polarization data","DSP board","false color representation","size 7.4 mum"]}],"abstract":"We present a novel polarization image sensor by monolithically integrating aluminum nanowire optical filters with CCD imaging array.

Such principle for scalable compression encounters a problem in the presence of transmission loss that the unpredictable loss in the base layer causes tremendous reduction of recognizable information by human perception. Multiple Description Coding (MDC) is defined to be robust in the presence of transmission loss and several MDC schemes have been proposed as extensions of the existing image and video compression standards. In this paper, a new presentation of image information based on the principle of MDC is proposed. The image is presented as samples whose density is variable according to the frequency energy. Moreover, the samples are able to be split into several partitions, promising that a recognizable approximation of the original content can be reconstructed by any partition, and more high frequency information can be reconstructed with more partitions, which fulfills the motivation of MDC.

In these scenarios the visual information is divided into frames and each one has to be completely processed before the next frame arrives in order to warranty the real-time. A spike-based philosophy for computing convolutions based on the neuro-inspired Address-Event-Representation (AER) is achieving high performances. In this paper we present two FPGA implementations of AER-based convolution processors for relatively small Xilinx FPGAs (Spartan-II 200 and Spartan-3 400), which process 64\u00d764 images with 11\u00d711 convolution kernels. The maximum equivalent operation rate that can be reached is 163.51 MOPS for 11\u00d711 kernels, in a Xilinx Spartan 3 400 FPGA with a 50MHz clock. Formulations, hardware architecture, operation examples and performance comparison with frame-based convolution processors are presented and discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537577","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537577.pdf","startPage":"4237","endPage":"4240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537577","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the AER convolution processors for FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537577/","displayDocTitle":"On the AER convolution processors for FPGA","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537577/","publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","accessionNumber":"11463544","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the AER convolution processors for FPGA","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"10752204.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070109S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5537578,"authors":[{"name":"Shantanu Chakrabartty","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Shantanu","lastName":"Chakrabartty","id":"37270086100"},{"name":"Shih-Chii Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Neuroinformatics, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Shih-Chii","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280142900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537578","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Limit-cycles","Statistical distributions","Neuromorphics","Encoding","Biomembranes","Neurons","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Acoustic noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern classification","speaker recognition","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spike-based dynamics","silicon cochlea","speaker identification","neuronal spike trains","limit cycle statistics","interspike interval distribution","Gini support vector machine","SVM classifier"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537578","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537578.pdf","startPage":"513","endPage":"516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537578","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting spike-based dynamics in a silicon cochlea for speaker identification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537578","abstract":"Limit-cycle dynamics embedded in neuronal spike-trains can form robust representations for encoding auditory spectral features.

In this paper, a novel factorization scheme based on Givens rotations and symmetrical nullification was devised. The proposed scheme successfully integrates the MMSE criterion into factorization and can achieve better BER performance. Instead of working on a complex-valued domain, the scheme starts with a block-wise symmetric real-valued matrix counterpart. By exploiting the symmetrical property, the proposed scheme effectively reduced almost half of the computing complexity. Based on the presented scheme, a novel systolic array design featuring fully parallel and deeply pipelined processing was developed subject to the EWC 802.11n recommendation. Architecture optimization measures such as look-up table (LUT) free CORDIC implementations and hardware sharing among scaling operations were employed to minimize the hardware design complexity. Post layout simulation results using TSMC 0.18\u03bcm process indicate the proposed design, with a gate count of 233K and a maximum clock rate of 120 MHz, can admit a new 4\u00d74 complex matrix for MMSE based factorization in every 8 clock cycles (66.7ns).","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537597","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537597.pdf","startPage":"4181","endPage":"4184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MMSE-QR factorization systolic array design for applications in MIMO signal detections","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537597","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537597/","displayDocTitle":"MMSE-QR factorization systolic array design for applications in MIMO signal detections","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462568","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537597/","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MMSE-QR factorization systolic array design for applications in MIMO signal detections","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"10612304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.140004S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537597","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5537600,"authors":[{"name":"Russell Dodd","affiliation":["University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Russell","lastName":"Dodd","id":"37540972200"},{"name":"Christian Schlegel","affiliation":["University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Schlegel","id":"37275119900"},{"name":"Vincent Gaudet","affiliation":["University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Gaudet","id":"37271661800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537600","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"abstract":"Computationally efficient joint detection in CDMA packetized communication is considered. The joint detection is based on iterative cancellation and utilizes only low complexity individual data receivers. The savings in complexity compared to other alternatives proposed in the literature is due to an encoding scheme known as partition spreading that can be decoded using algorithms that are similar to well-known turbo and sum-product decoding. Besides having a low computational complexity, the technique offers near-far resistant performance and can achieve higher system loads than conventional CDMA. The low complexity of these component receivers allows a large number of users to be implemented onto a single FPGA. A Virtex-IV on a Lyrtech Development board is used to implement a test bed for this PS-CDMA system. The implementation focuses on area optimization to give 50 users in a single Virtex-IV with 84% slice utilization and a maximum aggregate throughput of 192Mb/s. The measured performance of this prototype is compared against theoretical results on PS-CDMA in environments with varying power levels. An FPGA resource-performance analysis is given.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537600.pdf","startPage":"1763","endPage":"1766","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of enhanced CDMA utilizing low complexity joint detection with iterative processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Iterative decoding","Field programmable gate arrays","Encoding","Partitioning algorithms","Iterative algorithms","Computational complexity","System testing","Aggregates","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","communication complexity","field programmable gate arrays","iterative methods","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["enhanced CDMA packetized communication","low computational complexity joint detection","iterative processing","iterative cancellation","turbo decoding","sum-product decoding","Virtex-IV FPGA","Lyrtech Development board","PS-CDMA","FPGA resource-performance analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537600/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of enhanced CDMA utilizing low complexity joint detection with iterative processing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537600/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462570","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of enhanced CDMA utilizing low complexity joint detection with iterative processing","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"04483057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118181S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537600","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5537602,"authors":[{"name":"Elias S.

The two linear array architectures that we designed have been described as soft IP cores in fully parameterizable VHDL that can be used to synthesize effortlessly different k-NN parallel architectures for any desirable combination of the problem size parameters. They have been evaluated for a large variety of parameter combinations and Xilinx FPGAs. It is shown that they can be used to solve efficiently very large size k-NN classification problems, even with thousands of training vectors or vector dimensions, using a single, moderate size FPGA device.

In this paper we investigate fixed-width multipliers where one of the input operand is a constant, encoded using canonic signed digit (CSD) representation. This is a very important case in many practical applications such as the calculation of Fast Fourier Transform. In the paper we derive in closed form the expression of the compensation function giving the minimum mean square error for CSD fixed-width multiplier. On the basis of this analytical result, we propose a hardware efficient implementation of the multiplier. Fixed width CSD multipliers implemented with the approach presented in this paper are accurate and can be implemented by using a simple partial-product reduction tree followed by a fast adder, without requiring additional look-up tables. The proposed approach is general and is well suited for implementation in circuit synthesizers. Implementation results in 90 nm technology are presented, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mean square error methods","Hardware","Circuits","Fast Fourier transforms","Synthesizers","Electronic mail","Digital signal processing","Adders","Approximation error","Logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","compensation","least mean squares methods","multiplying circuits","table lookup","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fixed-width CSD multipliers","minimum mean square error","DSP","multimedia","canonic signed digit representation","fast Fourier transform","closed form expression","compensation function","simple partial-product reduction tree","fast adder","look-up tables","circuit synthesizers","size 90 nm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537606","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537606","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537606.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537606","startPage":"4149","endPage":"4152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fixed-width CSD multipliers with minimum mean square error","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fixed-width CSD multipliers with minimum mean square error","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537606/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537606/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462576","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fixed-width CSD multipliers with minimum mean square error","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"10531604.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061485S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537606","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5537618,"authors":[{"name":"Shuai Zhou","affiliation":["Institute of VLSI Design, Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Shuai","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37535255700"},{"name":"Jin Sha","affiliation":["Institute of VLSI Design, Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Sha","id":"37293859700"},{"name":"Li Li","affiliation":["Institute of VLSI Design, Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Li","id":"37280704400"},{"name":"Zhongfeng Wang","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhongfeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37279255300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537618","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":319},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Iterative decoding","Computational complexity","Very large scale integration","Floods","Medical services","Convergence","Algorithm design and analysis","Delay","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","message passing","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonbinary LDPC code","layered decoding algorithm","message-passing","check node message","serial decoding","locally-parallel globally-serial schedule","partially parallel decoder"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537618","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537618.pdf","startPage":"481","endPage":"484","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537618","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Layered decoding for non-binary LDPC codes","abstract":"In this paper, we present a layered decoding algorithm for non-binary LDPC codes.

To verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, a series of simulations is performed for irregular random LDPC codes with considering additive white Gaussian noise channel.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537628.pdf","startPage":"477","endPage":"480","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537628","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-rail decoding of low-density parity-check codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Phase change materials","Floods","Iterative decoding","Hardware","Throughput","Processor scheduling","Delay","Resource management","Additive white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","decoding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-rail decoding","low-density parity check codes","scheduling","resource utilization","LDPC codes","additive white Gaussian noise channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537628/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Dual-rail decoding of low-density parity-check codes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537628/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462598","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-rail decoding of low-density parity-check codes","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"01202264.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058281S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5537630,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Chang Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Formosa University, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Chang","lastName":"Lu","id":"37423118200"},{"name":"Wei-Xiang Tung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Formosa University, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Xiang","lastName":"Tung","id":"37547873300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537630","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Circuits","Energy consumption","Clocks","Calibration","Voltage","Sampling methods","Power amplifiers","Analog-digital conversion","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","CMOS digital integrated circuits","operational amplifiers","switched capacitor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS pipelined ADC","analog-to-digital converter","switched-capacitor multiply-by-two amplifier","opamp","gain error suppression","capacitor mismatch","power efficiency","single power supply","power consumption","CMOS process","voltage 1.5 V","frequency 10 MHz","power 76.8 mW","size 0.35 mum"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537630","abstract":"A 12-b 40-MSamples/s low power CMOS pipelined analog-to-digital converter is described.

Figure-of-merit of the proposed ADC is 545fJ/Conv, which is one of the lowest among the recently reported ADCs that achieve 10-bit resolution with sampling rates of hundreds of mega-hertz.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Energy consumption","Energy efficiency","Feedback","Rail to rail inputs","Pipelines","Timing","Energy resolution","Calibration","Analog-digital conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","CMOS integrated circuits","feedback","operational amplifiers","power consumption","sample and hold circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["10-bit pipelined ADC","time-interleaved SAR ADC","front-end stages","analog-to-digital converter","time-interleaved successive approximation register ADC","energy-efficient SAR-ADC","power hungry sample-and-hold amplifier","rail-to-rail input","MDAC feedback factor","power consumption","op-amp","CMOS integrated circuits","ADC figure-of-merit","operational amplifiers","size 90 nm","frequency 300 MHz","power 77 mW","voltage 1.2 V"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537646","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537646.pdf","startPage":"4041","endPage":"4044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 10-bit 300MSample/s pipelined ADC using time-interleaved SAR ADC for front-end stages","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537646","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 10-bit 300MSample/s pipelined ADC using time-interleaved SAR ADC for front-end stages","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537646/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537646/","accessionNumber":"11462693","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 10-bit 300MSample/s pipelined ADC using time-interleaved SAR ADC for front-end stages","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"10263159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075729S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537646","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5537648,"authors":[{"name":"Jiangli Zhu","affiliation":["Case Western Reserve University, USA"],"firstName":"Jiangli","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37310440800"},{"name":"Xinmiao Zhang","affiliation":["Case Western Reserve University, USA"],"firstName":"Xinmiao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279339400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537648","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":250},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reed-Solomon codes","Decoding","Variable speed drives","Interpolation","Polynomials","Delay","Computer architecture","Throughput","Equations","Error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebraic codes","decoding","interpolation","matrix decomposition","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebraic soft-decision decoding","Reed-Solomon decoding","highspeed reencoder design","polynomial complexity","ASD algorithms","interpolation","factorization","erasure locator","evaluator polynomials"]}],"abstract":"Algebraic soft-decision decoding (ASD) of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes can provide substantial coding gain with polynomial complexity. The major steps of ASD algorithms are the interpolation and factorization. To greatly reduce the complexity of these steps, the re-encoding and coordinate transformation techniques need to be applied. The implementation of these techniques requires a re-encoder and an erasure decoder. In re-encoded and transformed ASD decoders, these two blocks take a significant proportion of the overall area requirement and may limit the maximum achievable speed. A novel re-encoder design is proposed in this paper. In the proposed design, the erasure locator and evaluator polynomials are computed directly through multiplications and other involved computations are reformulated to reduce latency and area requirement. Scalable architectures for the proposed re-encoder are developed. When these architectures are applied to a (255, 239) RS code, our re-encoder can achieve 82% higher throughput than the previous design with 11% less area. With minor modifications, the proposed design can also be used to implement an efficient erasure decoder.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537648","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537648.pdf","startPage":"465","endPage":"468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537648","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-speed re-encoder design for algebraic soft-decision Reed-Solomon decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537648","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537648/","displayDocTitle":"High-speed re-encoder design for algebraic soft-decision Reed-Solomon decoding","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462695","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537648/","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-speed re-encoder design for algebraic soft-decision Reed-Solomon decoding","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"01171091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051994S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537648","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5537654,"authors":[{"name":"Nima Maghari","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Nima","lastName":"Maghari","id":"37269787500"},{"name":"Un-Ku Moon","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Un-Ku","lastName":"Moon","id":"37276672400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537654","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":300},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise shaping","Delta modulation","Bandwidth","Sampling methods","Quantization","Phase modulation","Voltage","Clocks","Capacitors","Moon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit noise","delta-sigma modulation","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["double-sampled path-coupled single-loop \u03a3\u0394 modulator","noise-shaped integrating quantizer","single-loop delta-sigma modulator","local path coupling","quantization error"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537654","abstract":"A single-loop delta-sigma modulator based on path-coupling and double-sampling is proposed.

By compensating extra one error outside the least reliable set, the error correcting ability is improved. In addition, the proposed error locator evaluator evaluates error locations without Chien search, leading to high throughput. As compared with the traditional hard BCH decoder, the experimental result reveals that our proposed improved soft BCH decoder can achieve 0.75db coding gain for BCH (255,239) code.

The results show that the receiver achieves 150Mbps data rate and consumes HOmW power at 7.81MHz, which meets the requirement of Mode I~III OFDMA modes for the 3GPP-LTE system.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537676.pdf","startPage":"3957","endPage":"3960","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537676","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of 4 \u00d7 4 MIMO-OFDMA receiver with precode codebook search for 3GPP-LTE","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","OFDM","Mobile communication","Very large scale integration","Baseband","Radio transmitters","Channel estimation","CMOS technology","Wireless LAN","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","channel estimation","frequency division multiple access","matrix inversion","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["precode codebook search","3GPP LTE","MIMO-OFDMA receiver","mobile communications","synchronization","channel estimation","channel compensation","MIMO detection","MMSE-OSIC algorithm","matrix inversion","Strassen algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537676/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Design of 4 \u00d7 4 MIMO-OFDMA receiver with precode codebook search for 3GPP-LTE","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537676/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462728","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of 4 \u00d7 4 MIMO-OFDMA receiver with precode codebook search for 3GPP-LTE","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"10052433.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051032S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537676","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5537680,"authors":[{"name":"Barath Vasudevan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tolctlo and E\u00f6tv\u00f6s L\u00e1rand University, Toledo, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Barath","lastName":"Vasudevan","id":"37543416500"},{"name":"Mohammed Niamat","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tolctlo and E\u00f6tv\u00f6s L\u00e1rand University, Toledo, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Niamat","id":"37353035200"},{"name":"Mansoor Alam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tolctlo and E\u00f6tv\u00f6s L\u00e1rand University, Toledo, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Mansoor","lastName":"Alam","id":"37349858700"},{"name":"Srinivasa Vemuru","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio Northern University, Ada, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Srinivasa","lastName":"Vemuru","id":"37355334800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537680","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":191},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Failure analysis","Electromigration","Field programmable gate arrays","Integrated circuit interconnections","Current density","Logic testing","Temperature","Benchmark testing","Frequency domain analysis","Circuit testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self test","electromigration","field programmable gate arrays","Fourier transforms","interconnections","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromigration failures","FPGA","submicron device","current density","temperature","component failure","SRAM","field programmable gate arrays","mean time to failure","interconnects","frequency domain built-in-self test","BIST","arithmetic Fourier transform"]}],"abstract":"With the scaling of submicron device dimensions, the current density and the temperature of interconnects have increased many folds leading to component failure due to electromigration.

Over 50% energy reduction is achieved.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537714","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537714.pdf","startPage":"3837","endPage":"3840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient asynchronous delay element with wide controllability","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537714","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537714/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient asynchronous delay element with wide controllability","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462782","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537714/","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient asynchronous delay element with wide controllability","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"09751753.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063633S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537714","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5537723,"authors":[{"name":"Oreste Villa","affiliation":["High Performance Computing, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Oreste","lastName":"Villa","id":"37408471700"},{"name":"Long Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Chen","id":"37406312300"},{"name":"Sriram Krishnamoorthy","affiliation":["High Performance Computing, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Sriram","lastName":"Krishnamoorthy","id":"37283825700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537723","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","High performance computing","Load management","Hardware","Processor scheduling","Parallel processing","Kernel","Laboratories","Power engineering computing","Dynamic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","computer graphics","coprocessors","multiprocessing systems","parallel processing","processor scheduling","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high performance molecular dynamic simulation","computational power","multi-GPU systems","graphic processing unit","task based dynamic load balancing solution","single GPU system","CUDA scheduler","CUDA API"]}],"abstract":"The computational power provided by many-core graphics processing units (GPUs) has been exploited in many applications. The programming techniques supported and employed on these GPUs and Multi-GPUs systems are not sufficient to address problems exhibiting irregular, and unbalanced workload such as Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations of systems with non-uniform densities. In this paper, we propose a task-based dynamic load-balancing solution to employ on MD simulations for single- and multi-GPU systems. The solution allows load balancing at a finer granularity than what is supported in existing APIs such as NVIDIA's CUDA. Experimental results with a single-GPU configuration show that our fine-grained task solution can utilize the hardware more efficiently than the CUDA scheduler. On multi-GPU systems, our solution achieves near-linear speedup, load balance, and significant performance improvement over techniques based on standard CUDA APIs.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537723","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537723.pdf","startPage":"3805","endPage":"3808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High performance Molecular Dynamic simulation on single and multi-GPU systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537723","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537723/","displayDocTitle":"High performance Molecular Dynamic simulation on single and multi-GPU systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462834","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537723/","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High performance Molecular Dynamic simulation on single and multi-GPU systems","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"09673290.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059565S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537723","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5537730,"authors":[{"name":"Isael Diaz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Isael","lastName":"Diaz","id":"37529432900"},{"name":"Leif Wilhelmsson","affiliation":["Ericsson Research Limited, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Leif","lastName":"Wilhelmsson","id":"37294075300"},{"name":"Joachim Rodrigues","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Joachim","lastName":"Rodrigues","id":"37270890900"},{"name":"Johan L\u00f6fgren","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Johan","lastName":"L\u00f6fgren","id":"37540362600"},{"name":"Thomas Olsson","affiliation":["Ericsson Research Limited, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Olsson","id":"37267975600"},{"name":"Viktor \u00d6wall","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Viktor","lastName":"\u00d6wall","id":"37271343400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537730","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":239},"abstract":"This paper presents an architecture of an autocorrelator for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing systems.

When the code rate becomes high, however, there will be a lot of degree-2 symbol nodes in the \u201cpure\u201d SF-LDPC codes. As a consequence, when the codes are constructed by connecting the symbol nodes with the check nodes, many small-size cycles will be formed.

However, objective distortion metrics such as mean square error traditionally used in this framework are poorly correlated with perceptual video quality. To address this issue, we incorporate the structural similarity index as a quality metric into the framework and develop a predictive Lagrange multiplier selection technique to resolve the chicken-and-egg dilemma of perceptual-based RDO. The resulting perceptual-based RDO is then applied to H.264 intra mode decision as an illustration of the application of the proposed technique. Given a perceptual quality level, 5%-10% bit rate reduction over the JM reference software of H.264 is achieved. Subjective evaluation further confirms that, at the same bit-rate, the proposed perceptual RDO preserves image details and prevents block artifact better than the traditional RDO.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537738.pdf","startPage":"393","endPage":"396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Perceptual-based coding mode decision","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537738","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537738","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537738/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Perceptual-based coding mode decision","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462848","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5537738/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Perceptual-based coding mode decision","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00991765.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043877S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5537740,"authors":[{"name":"Hsin-Fu Luo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsin-Fu","lastName":"Luo","id":"37534437500"},{"name":"Ming-Der Shieh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Der","lastName":"Shieh","id":"37266682200"},{"name":"Yi-Jun Liu","affiliation":["National Applied Research Laboratories, Chip Implementation Center, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Jun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37537571900"},{"name":"Chien-Ming Wu","affiliation":["National Applied Research Laboratories, Chip Implementation Center, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chien-Ming","lastName":"Wu","id":"37276424400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537740","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memory management","Read-write memory","Memory architecture","Computer architecture","Discrete Fourier transforms","Engineering management","Fast Fourier transforms","Energy consumption","OFDM","Power dissipation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","memory architecture","power consumption","storage allocation","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memory management","FFT processors","memory based architecture","fast Fourier transform","data relocating scheme","power dissipation","memory addressing method","merged banked single ported memory","high radix processing elements","power consumption"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an efficient memory management scheme for memory-based architecture of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).

According to the application requirements and the design constraints, the optimization process could be controlled by the designer by specifying weight factors for area and delay. As a proof of concept, our technique is applied to three real applications with different number of cores.

These architectures induce extra delays due to the node-to-node communication process. In multiboard & multichip SNNs, important delays may affect spike arrival time and, thus, can alter simulation results. In this work, we propose a method aiming to guarantee spike arrival time with arbitrary prefixed deadlines. The communication architecture is based on the token-passing access policy to grant access to shared communication channels. We show that several network parameters must be set carefully if spikes have to meet their deadlines. Parameters are chosen by taking into account the communication channel bandwidth, the arbitrary deadlines and the worst case situation that can happen in generating neural activity in SNNs. As proof of concept, we have built a system that emulates up to 120 analog Hodgkin-Huxley neurons spread across 6 boards. Experimental results show that whatever it happens (unless there is a network fault), spikes reach their destination with a maximum delay of 5 microseconds.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537758","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537758.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537758","startPage":"377","endPage":"380","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537758","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537758/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Guaranteeing spike arrival time in multiboard & multichip spiking neural networks","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5537758/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462868","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guaranteeing spike arrival time in multiboard & multichip spiking neural networks","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00951958.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054463S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537758","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5537777,"authors":[{"name":"Danial Chitnis","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"],"firstName":"Danial","lastName":"Chitnis","id":"37543079100"},{"name":"Steve Collins","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"],"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Collins","id":"37274573100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537777","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":549},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537777","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage","Diodes","MOSFET circuits","Photonics","Pulse circuits","Pulse generation","Counting circuits","Charge carrier processes","High-resolution imaging","Dynamic range"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["avalanche photodiodes","image sensors","photodetectors","readout electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single photon avalanche diodes","readout circuits","voltage pulse","analogue circuits","photon detectors"]}],"abstract":"Single Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) create a very short duration voltage pulse whenever a photon is detected.

With further development, these circuits could be used in imagers capable of imaging in very low light levels.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537777","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537777.pdf","startPage":"357","endPage":"360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact readout circuits for SPAD arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537777/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Compact readout circuits for SPAD arrays","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462925","htmlLink":"/document/5537777/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact readout circuits for SPAD arrays","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00902081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095729S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5537787,"authors":[{"name":"Raphael Berner","affiliation":["Institute of Neuroinformatics, University of Zurich, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Raphael","lastName":"Berner","id":"37320566800"},{"name":"Tobi Delbruck","affiliation":["Institute of Neuroinformatics, University of Zurich, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Tobi","lastName":"Delbruck","id":"37269976700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537787","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537787","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuits","Color","CMOS process","Absorption","Silicon","Testing","Optical reflection","Optical sensors","Delay","CMOS image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","image colour analysis","optical sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["event-based color change pixel","standard CMOS","dichromatic spiking pixel circuit","buried double junction","light wavelength detection","optical sensor"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes a novel dichromatic spiking pixel circuit that reacts to color change but not to intensity change.

While photonics offers superior bandwidth density, lower latencies, and improvements in energy efficiency over electronics, the photonic network designs that can leverage these benefits cannot be easily derived by simply mimicking electronic layouts. In fact, proper implementations of photonic interconnects will require the careful consideration of a variety new physical-layer metrics and design requirements that did not exist with electronics. Here, we review some of the currently proposed designs for chip-scale photonic interconnection networks, the design methodologies required to produce viable network topologies, and a simulation environment, called PhoenixSim, that we have developed to accurately model and study those metrics and designs.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537792","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537792.pdf","startPage":"3605","endPage":"3608","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tools and methodologies for designing energy-efficient photonic networks-on-chip for highperformance chip multiprocessors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537792","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Tools and methodologies for designing energy-efficient photonic networks-on-chip for highperformance chip multiprocessors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537792/","publicationDate":"May 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11462940","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537792/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tools and methodologies for designing energy-efficient photonic networks-on-chip for highperformance chip multiprocessors","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"09173336.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069421S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5537798,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantin Nikolic","affiliation":["Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Konstantin","lastName":"Nikolic","id":"37542932600"},{"name":"Chris Toumazou","affiliation":["Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Toumazou","id":"37271540100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537798","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustic noise","Photoreceptors","Optoelectronic and photonic sensors","Analog computers","Biological system modeling","Semiconductor device modeling","Sensor arrays","Absorption","Permeability","Working environment noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biocomputers","biocomputing","biology computing","enzymes","infrared detectors","lab-on-a-chip","photons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["G-protein","Drosophila photoreceptor","bio-inspired ultrasensitive imaging chip","quantum efficiency","single photon response","light intensity","enzymatic cascade model","analogue amplifier","sensitive sensory system","infrared detector","phototransduction model","design realization"]}],"abstract":"Recently we have completed a system level modelling of the G-protein coupled cascade in Drosophila photoreceptors that converts single photons into transient electrical responses. Many interesting properties were revealed including the underlying mechanisms by which the system generates high quantum efficiency, single photon responses, huge signal amplification and fast recovery, as well as light adaptation to 11 orders of magnitude of light intensities. Now we would like to use this enzymatic cascade model as a design blueprint for a cascade of analogue amplifiers. These circuits can then be used in very sensitive sensory systems such as imaging chips or uncooled infrared detectors and cameras.

It has been proved that Analog-to-digital Converters (ADCs) using a non equi-repartition in time of samples leads to interesting power savings compared to Nyquist ADCs. A new class of ADCs called A-ADCs (for Asynchronous ADCs) based on level-crossing sampling (which produces non-uniform samples in time) and asynchronous technology has been developed.

The VLSI implementation is based on a novel hardware-optimized LLL algorithm that has 70% lower complexity than the traditional complex LLL algorithm. This reduction is achieved by replacing all the computationally intensive CLLL operations (multiplication, division and square root) with low-complexity additions and comparisons. The VLSI implementation uses a pipelined architecture that produces an LR-reduced matrix every 40 cycles, which is a 60% reduction compared to current implementations. The proposed design was synthesized in both 130\u03bcm and 65nm CMOS resulting in clock speeds of 332MHz and 833MHz, respectively. The 65nm result is a 4\u00d7 improvement over the fastest LR implementation to date. The proposed LR implementation is able to sustain a throughput of 2Gbps, thus achieving the high data rates required by future standards such as IEEE 802.16m (WiMAX) and LTE-Advanced.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537810.pdf","startPage":"3541","endPage":"3544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI implementation of a hardware-optimized lattice reduction algorithm for WiMAX/LTE MIMO detection","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537810","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537810","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537810/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"VLSI implementation of a hardware-optimized lattice reduction algorithm for WiMAX/LTE MIMO detection","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462985","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5537810/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI implementation of a hardware-optimized lattice reduction algorithm for WiMAX/LTE MIMO detection","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"09013046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055909S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5537814,"authors":[{"name":"Yuuki Araga","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Systems Engineering, Kobe University, Kobe, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuuki","lastName":"Araga","id":"37543009600"},{"name":"Takushi Hashida","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Systems Engineering, Kobe University, Kobe, Japan"],"firstName":"Takushi","lastName":"Hashida","id":"37529984200"},{"name":"Makoto Nagata","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Systems Engineering, Kobe University, Kobe, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Nagata","id":"37267253800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537814","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"abstract":"An on-chip waveform capturing technique demonstrates 8.5 ENOB and 62.7 dB SFDR at 200 Ms/s for analog signals with 25-MHz bandwidth and 2.5 V rail-to-rail offset DC level, suitable for testing and self diagnosis of a mixed-signal chip.

For time-varying channels, the uncoded average BER of the conventional geometric mean decomposition (GMD) based systems is not minimized because of the diverse arithmetic MSEs at different block times. To minimize the BER, a new GMD transceiver is proposed, in which the data vectors are grouped into space-time blocks (ST-blocks). A channel independent-temporal precoder is superimposed on the conventional blockwise GMD for the equalization of arithmetic MSEs across different blocks. So, the proposed system can take advantage of both the temporal and spatial diversity offered by time-varying MIMO channels. At moderate high SNR, corresponding to reasonable BER, there exists a class of optimal channel-independent temporal precoders, e.g., DFT and Hadamard matrices, for the minimization of average BER. Furthermore, simulation results show that the average BER performance of the proposed system improves with ST-block size and converges at moderate ST-block size.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537823","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537823.pdf","startPage":"3525","endPage":"3528","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537823","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ZF-DFE transceiver for time-varying MIMO channels with channel-independent temporal precoder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537823/","displayDocTitle":"ZF-DFE transceiver for time-varying MIMO channels with channel-independent temporal precoder","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11462998","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537823/","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ZF-DFE transceiver for time-varying MIMO channels with channel-independent temporal precoder","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"08971059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074158S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537823","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5537824,"authors":[{"name":"Kelvin Lee","affiliation":["EE Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kelvin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37540308500"},{"name":"Babak Daneshrad","affiliation":["EE Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Babak","lastName":"Daneshrad","id":"37279708000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537824","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":281},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Energy efficiency","Decoding","MIMO","Bit error rate","CMOS technology","Lattices","Throughput","Sorting","Application specific integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","error statistics","MIMO communication","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI implementation","MIMO communication system","multiple input multiple output decoder","fixed complexity sphere decoder algorithm","pairwise sorted QR decomposition searching approach","bit error rate","data swapping","power efficient architecture","CMOS technology","BPSK","antenna array","voltage 0.8 V"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a low power VLSI implementation of a novel Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) decoder which combines Fixed Complexity Sphere Decoder (FSD) algorithm, real-valued lattice formulation and Pair-wise sorted QR decomposition (P-SQRD) searching approach to simultaneously improve the throughput, bit error rate (BER) and complexity.

Our result demonstrates that with a proper choice of storage size the proposed method visits 40% fewer nodes than a sphere decoding algorithm at signal to noise ratio (SNR) = 20dB and by an order of magnitude at 0 dB SNR.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A best-first tree-searching approach for ML decoding in MIMO system","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537825","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537825.pdf","startPage":"3533","endPage":"3536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537825","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537825","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537825/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"A best-first tree-searching approach for ML decoding in MIMO system","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537825/","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11463000","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A best-first tree-searching approach for ML decoding in MIMO system","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"08991325.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06569S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537825","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5537826,"authors":[{"name":"Xuebin Wu","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Xuebin","lastName":"Wu","id":"37539925600"},{"name":"Yongmei Dai","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Yongmei","lastName":"Dai","id":"37278734300"},{"name":"Zhiyuan Yan","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhiyuan","lastName":"Yan","id":"37274912700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537826","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Computational complexity","Detectors","Receiving antennas","Decoding","Transmitting antennas","Hardware","Search problems","Additive white noise","AWGN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","decoding","MIMO communication","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft decision MIMO detection","tree search algorithm","computational complexity","decoding detector","sequential detector"]}],"abstract":"How to cope with the complexities of sophisticated multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques is critical to realizing these MIMO techniques in real-life applications. In this paper, we propose a list-based soft-decision MIMO detection algorithm based on the memory constraint tree search algorithm. Our algorithm achieves a flexible tradeoff between the memory requirement and computational complexity by tuning the number of available memory units. In comparison with the list sphere decoding detector, our algorithm has reduced computational complexity; as opposed to the list sequential detector, our algorithm achieves similar computational complexity while requiring much less memory. Hence, our algorithm is suitable for hardware implementations.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537826","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537826.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","startPage":"3537","endPage":"3540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"List based soft-decision MIMO detection by the MCTS algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537826","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"List based soft-decision MIMO detection by the MCTS algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537826/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11463001","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5537826/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"List based soft-decision MIMO detection by the MCTS algorithm","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"09002000.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085748S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5537827,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Frustaci","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Computer Science and Systems, University of Calabria, Rende, Cosenza, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Frustaci","id":"37543009800"},{"name":"Stefania Perri","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Computer Science and Systems, University of Calabria, Rende, Cosenza, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefania","lastName":"Perri","id":"37283398500"},{"name":"Marco Lanuzza","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Computer Science and Systems, University of Calabria, Rende, Cosenza, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Lanuzza","id":"37282897600"},{"name":"Pasquale Corsonello","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Computer Science and Systems, University of Calabria, Rende, Cosenza, Italy"],"firstName":"Pasquale","lastName":"Corsonello","id":"37283399400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537827","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":698},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537827","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy dissipation","Clocks","Computer architecture","Energy consumption","Computer science","Switching circuits","Delay","Adders","Logic","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","clocks","comparators (circuits)","high-speed integrated circuits","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power high-speed single-clock-cycle binary comparator","parallel-prefix algorithm","ST technology","low-power high-speed parallel-prefix adder","size 90 nm","voltage 1 V","word length 64 bit","time 258 ps"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new ultra-low power high-speed single-clock-cycle binary comparator.

Fully depleted silicon on insulator CMOS is a primary candidate for such electronics as they are less affected by low temperature bulk induced hysteresis and kink effects and have lower parasitic capacitances than their bulk counterparts. While MOS transistors are known to work at low temperatures, a hitherto unexplored maxim of integrated circuit design is the use of matched components at low temperatures. In this study, we investigate the effect of low temperature operation on the matching in CMOS current mirrors: we compare measurements of the low frequency accuracy in a silicon on sapphire mirror at 300K and 4K. We find that while matching is reduced at low temperatures, circuit structures relying on matching components can still be employed at low temperatures albeit at reduced performance.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537861","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mirrors","Temperature control","Silicon on insulator technology","Hysteresis","Parasitic capacitance","MOSFETs","Integrated circuit synthesis","Current measurement","Frequency measurement","Integrated circuit measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit design","silicon-on-insulator"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SOS current mirror matching","silicon qubits","CMOS electronics","silicon on insulator","parasitic capacitance","low temperature operation","CMOS current mirrors","sapphire mirror","temperature 300 K","temperature 4 K"]}],"publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537861.pdf","startPage":"3405","endPage":"3408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537861","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SOS current mirror matching at 4K: A brief study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537861/","displayDocTitle":"SOS current mirror matching at 4K: A brief study","isDynamicHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11463074","htmlLink":"/document/5537861/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SOS current mirror matching at 4K: A brief study","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"08671032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071144S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537861","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5537864,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Yu Lin","affiliation":["Nanoelectronics and Gigascale Systems Laboratory, Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Yu","lastName":"Lin","id":"37404180100"},{"name":"Ming-Dou Ker","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan","Nanoelectronics and Gigascale Systems Laboratory, Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Dou","lastName":"Ker","id":"37270498300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537864","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":396},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537864","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrostatic discharge","Clamps","Circuits","CMOS process","Voltage","Logic devices","MOS devices","Protection","Variable structure systems","CMOS technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","electrostatic discharge","integrated circuit design","leakage currents","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VDD-tolerant power-rail ESD clamp circuit","low standby leakage","CMOS process","high-voltage-tolerant ESD detection circuit","turn-on efficiency","silicon-controlled-rectifier-based ESD device"]}],"abstract":"With the consideration of low standby leakage in nanoscale CMOS processes, a new 2\u00d7VDD-tolerant ESD clamp circuit was presented in this paper.

Features extracted from this component allows a linear SVM classifier to achieve 2.2% False Acceptance Rate and 13% False Rejection Rate (6.7% Equal Error Rate). We also show that the classifier can be generalizable to contrast enhanced recaptured images and LCD screen recaptured images without re-training, demonstrating the robustness of our approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537866.pdf","startPage":"3425","endPage":"3428","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537866","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537866","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Is physics-based liveness detection truly possible with a single image?","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face detection","Face recognition","Robustness","Eyes","Authentication","Humans","Image generation","Feature extraction","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","liquid crystal displays","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physics-based liveness detection","single image","face recognition","authentication","images detect","feature extraction","linear SVM classifier","false rejection rate","false acceptance rate","LCD screen"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537866/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Is physics-based liveness detection truly possible with a single image?","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537866/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11463079","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Is physics-based liveness detection truly possible with a single image?","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"08721871.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.142116S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5537867,"authors":[{"name":"Mingoo Seok","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Mingoo","lastName":"Seok","id":"37541098600"},{"name":"Scott Hanson","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Hanson","id":"37314635400"},{"name":"Michael Wieckowski","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Wieckowski","id":"37281691400"},{"name":"Gregory K.

However, their promise of increased performance will only be reached if their inherent scaling and programming challenges are overcome. Meanwhile, recent advances in nanophotonic device manufacturing are making CMOS-integrated optics a reality-interconnect technology which can provide more bandwidth at lower power than conventional electronics. Perhaps more importantly, optical interconnect also has the potential to enable new, easy-to-use programming models enabled by its inexpensive broadcast mechanism. This paper introduces ATAC, a new manycore architecture that capitalizes on the recent advances in optics to address a number of challenges that future manycore designs will face. The new constraints and opportunities of on-chip optical interconnect are presented and explored in the design of ATAC. Furthermore, this paper discusses ATAC's programming models, and introduces Consumer Tagging, a novel programming model that leverages ATAC's strengths to provide high performance and scalability.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537892","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network-on-a-chip","Optical fiber networks","Optical interconnections","Optical design","Multicore processing","Nanoscale devices","Manufacturing","Optical devices","CMOS technology","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated optoelectronics","nanophotonics","optical interconnections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ATAC","on-chip optical networks","nanophotonic device manufacturing","CMOS-integrated optics","programming models","on-chip optical interconnect","consumer tagging"]}],"publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537892.pdf","startPage":"3325","endPage":"3328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537892","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537892","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ATAC: Improving performance and programmability with on-chip optical networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537892/","displayDocTitle":"ATAC: Improving performance and programmability with on-chip optical networks","isDynamicHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11463105","htmlLink":"/document/5537892/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ATAC: Improving performance and programmability with on-chip optical networks","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"08473361.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06375S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537892","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":5537893,"authors":[{"name":"Ivan Beretta","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Lausanne, VD, CH"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Beretta","id":"37395374000"},{"name":"Vincenzo Rana","affiliation":["Embedded Systems Laboratory (ESL), EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland","Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Vincenzo","lastName":"Rana","id":"37295957000"},{"name":"David Atienza","affiliation":["Embedded Systems Laboratory (ESL), EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Atienza","id":"37275656500"},{"name":"Donatella Sciuto","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Donatella","lastName":"Sciuto","id":"37273958200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537893","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Runtime","Field programmable gate arrays","Design automation","Application software","Algorithm design and analysis","System-on-a-chip","Hardware","Computer applications","Design methodology","Design optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CAD","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["run-time mapping","FPGA","reconfigurable systems","field-programmable gate arrays","system-on-chip design","SoC","computer-aided design tools","CAD","communication overhead","off-line static-mapping"]}],"abstract":"The role of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) in System-on-Chip (SoC) design considerably increased in the last few years. Their established importance is due to the large amount of hardware resources they offer, as well as to their increasing performance, and furthermore to the support for reconfigurability. Even though FPGAs seem to have reached their maturity, there is still a lack of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools able to deal with dynamic reconfiguration. Existing algorithms aim at optimizing the performance of a set of applications, basing the computation on classic metrics (such as communication overhead), while reconfiguration-related issues are not taken into consideration. This work proposes a design methodology to map several applications on the FPGA area at run-time. Starting from a basic solution found at design-time for the initial set of applications, the proposed algorithm makes it possible to map a new application (not known at design-time), both minimizing the number of synthesis processes and optimizing the on-chip performance of the new application. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to achieve up to a 18% reduction in the number of reconfigurations with respect to an off-line static-mapping approach, while generally preserving the performance of the executed applications on the FPGA.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Run-time mapping of applications on FPGA-based reconfigurable systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537893","startPage":"3329","endPage":"3332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537893.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537893","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537893/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Run-time mapping of applications on FPGA-based reconfigurable systems","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537893/","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11463106","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Run-time mapping of applications on FPGA-based reconfigurable systems","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"08483318.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03631S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5537895,"authors":[{"name":"Igor Loi","affiliation":["DEIS, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Igor","lastName":"Loi","id":"37408507000"},{"name":"Pol Marchal","affiliation":["IMEC vzw, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Pol","lastName":"Marchal","id":"37265044400"},{"name":"Antonio Pullini","affiliation":["INoCs, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Pullini","id":"37541605100"},{"name":"Luca Benini","affiliation":["DEIS, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Benini","id":"37274443600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537895","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":334},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537895","abstract":"Networks-on-chip have been developed in the last few years to address the scalability challenges of global on-chip communication.

The key idea is to modify already existing Address Event Representation (AER) designs so that there is a periodic reset signal that can be generated every time some predefined proportion of \"neurons\" has emitted a spike. Each \"neuron\" only emits at most one spike per processing cycle, but the most strongly activated neurons fire first, ensuring that information about the image is transmitted with maximum efficiency. Simulations demonstrate that this sort of design can allow image reconstruction under conditions where only a few percent of the units have emitted a spike. This means that the reset signal can be triggered at high rates allowing images to be processed at very high clock rates but in a way that could automatically adjust to variations in environmental conditions including scene contrast.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537898","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537898.pdf","startPage":"265","endPage":"268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Suggestions for a biologically inspired spiking retina using order-based coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537898","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537898/","displayDocTitle":"Suggestions for a biologically inspired spiking retina using order-based coding","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11463150","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537898/","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Suggestions for a biologically inspired spiking retina using order-based coding","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00673322.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033124S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5537907,"authors":[{"name":"Yann LeCun","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, USA"],"firstName":"Yann","lastName":"LeCun","id":"37282875900"},{"name":"Koray Kavukcuoglu","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, USA"],"firstName":"Koray","lastName":"Kavukcuoglu","id":"37397824000"},{"name":"Clement Farabet","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, USA"],"firstName":"Clement","lastName":"Farabet","id":"37392217400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537907","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":776,"citationCountPatent":22,"totalDownloads":10344},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Learning systems","Visual perception","Machine learning","Filter bank","Optical character recognition software","Video surveillance","Unsupervised learning","Object recognition","Navigation","Mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","object recognition","robot vision","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional networks","intelligent tasks","internal representations","machine learning","biologically-inspired architecture","ConvNets","filter bank","feature pooling layers","multilevel hierarchies","labeled training samples","unsupervised learning","visual object recognition","vision navigation","off-road mobile robots"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537907","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537907.pdf","startPage":"253","endPage":"256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537907","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convolutional networks and applications in vision","abstract":"Intelligent tasks, such as visual perception, auditory perception, and language understanding require the construction of good internal representations of the world (or \"features\")? which must be invariant to irrelevant variations of the input while, preserving relevant information. A major question for Machine Learning is how to learn such good features automatically. Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) are a biologically-inspired trainable architecture that can learn invariant features. Each stage in a ConvNets is composed of a filter bank, some nonlinearities, and feature pooling layers. With multiple stages, a ConvNet can learn multi-level hierarchies of features. While ConvNets have been successfully deployed in many commercial applications from OCR to video surveillance, they require large amounts of labeled training samples. We describe new unsupervised learning algorithms, and new non-linear stages that allow ConvNets to be trained with very few labeled samples.

This paper presents a self-oscillation drive loop for gyroscopes with a new amplitude regulation based on phase shifting. Instead of regulating the driving stage in order to control the oscillation amplitude of the primary mass to a constant value, this concept introduces a variable phase delay between the velocity of the primary mass and driving force in a self-oscillation drive loop. A Schmitt trigger with a tunable hysteresis is used to generate the necessary phase delay. Compared to conventional amplitude regulation this concept is beneficial, since the high voltages of the driving stage can be set to a constant value and do not have to be adjusted. As a result the analog circuit complexity is enormously reduced. Simulation results show the principle of maintaining the sensor deflection by a phase shifting element.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gyroscopes","Delay","Rotation measurement","Maintenance","Force control","Velocity control","Weight control","Trigger circuits","Tunable circuits and devices","Hysteresis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit complexity","circuit oscillations","Coriolis force","gyroscopes","microsensors","phase shifters","trigger circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude regulation","gyroscope drive loop","phase shift","Coriolis effect","self oscillation drive loop","oscillation amplitude","variable phase delay","Schmitt trigger","analog circuit complexity","sensor deflection","micromachined angular rate sensor"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537912","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537912.pdf","startPage":"3268","endPage":"3271","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537912","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An amplitude regulation for gyroscope drive loops based on phase-shifting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537912","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An amplitude regulation for gyroscope drive loops based on phase-shifting","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537912/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537912/","accessionNumber":"11463164","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An amplitude regulation for gyroscope drive loops based on phase-shifting","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"08331637.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039908S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537912","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5537916,"authors":[{"name":"Jorge R.

With their high sensitivity and high dynamic range requirements, the RF circuits have long had a good excuse to avoid any possible source of digital switching activity. With the constant scaling of CMOS feature size and the merciless push for integration, the existence of almost free and powerful digital logic could not go unnoticed. Hence, the environment was ripe to transform the RF functions into digital realizations, as well as to apply digital assistance to help with the performance of RF circuits. This paper revisits the digitization journey of the traditional charge-pump PLL and offers a few novel techniques to further improve area, current consumption, testability and reliability of frequency synthesizers.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537937","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537937","startPage":"229","endPage":"232","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537937.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"State-of-the-art and future directions of high-performance all-digital frequency synthesis in nanometer CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537937/","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"State-of-the-art and future directions of high-performance all-digital frequency synthesis in nanometer CMOS","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11463224","publicationDate":"May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5537937/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"State-of-the-art and future directions of high-performance all-digital frequency synthesis in nanometer CMOS","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00583341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040556S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5537945,"authors":[{"name":"Albert Garciai Tormo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University of Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Albert Garciai","lastName":"Tormo","id":"37541486700"},{"name":"Alberto Poveda","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University of Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Poveda","id":"37274231500"},{"name":"Eduard Alarc\u00f3n","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University of Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Eduard","lastName":"Alarc\u00f3n","id":"37274243200"},{"name":"Henk Jan Bergveld","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors, Corporate I&T, Research, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Henk Jan","lastName":"Bergveld","id":"37283979500"},{"name":"Berry Buter","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors, Corporate I&T, Research, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Berry","lastName":"Buter","id":"37543229800"},{"name":"Ravi Karadi","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors, Corporate I&T, Research, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Ravi","lastName":"Karadi","id":"37543229300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537945","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Voltage","Switching converters","High power amplifiers","Filters","Power semiconductor switches","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Costs","Filtering","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifiers","PWM power convertors","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switching policy enhancement","buck-derived multilevel switching power amplifiers","multilevel PWM modulation","multilevel full-bridge switching power converters"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537945","abstract":"This work proposes a switching policy for multi-level full-bridge switching power converters and analyses their performance by driving them with a multi-level PWM modulation, targeting high-efficiency power amplifiers.

The sliding origin method (SOM) sliding moves the origin of integration region to achieve the most memory reduction.

Considering that the perfect channel state information (CSI) between the mobile terminal and the relays is usually not available, the new beamforming problem, based on the minimization of the sum MSE (mean squared error) subject to a total relay power, is formulated such that only the CSI between the base station and the relays is required. The constrained beamforming optimization problem is then solved by the Lagrangian multiplier method, leading to a closed-form solution for the distributed relay beamforming.

Simulations show that by utilizing device size variation, our cascode PA achieves higher gain and PAE compared to conventional fixed-size cascode PA in the low power region; in addition, it also provides more output power and higher average PAE than single-stage common-emitter PAs. We also studied and compared the linearity performance of our cascode PAs vs. single-stage common-emitter PAs in a RF polar TX using an envelope tracking (ET) technique. We found that even through self-biasing for the common-base device can improve the output distortion of cascode PAs, a single-stage common-emitter SiGe PA designed for comparison is still considerably more linear than cascode PAs. Therefore, more careful system linearization design will be critical when the cascode PAs are adopted in RF polar transmitters (TXs), especially for broadband wireless applications such as mobile WiMAX studied here.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537979","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537979","startPage":"1915","endPage":"1918","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537979.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficiency enhancement and linearity trade-offs for cascode vs. common-emitter SiGe power amplifiers in WiMAX polar transmitters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Efficiency enhancement and linearity trade-offs for cascode vs. common-emitter SiGe power amplifiers in WiMAX polar transmitters","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537979/","accessionNumber":"11463299","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537979/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficiency enhancement and linearity trade-offs for cascode vs. common-emitter SiGe power amplifiers in WiMAX polar transmitters","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"04863116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046165S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537979","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5537992,"authors":[{"name":"Yuichi Tanaka","affiliation":["Department of Information Science, Utsunomiya University, Utsunomiya, Tochigi, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuichi","lastName":"Tanaka","id":"37396738600"},{"name":"Madoka Hasegawa","affiliation":["Department of Information Science, Utsunomiya University, Utsunomiya, Tochigi, Japan"],"firstName":"Madoka","lastName":"Hasegawa","id":"37361342800"},{"name":"Shigeo Kato","affiliation":["Department of Information Science, Utsunomiya University, Utsunomiya, Tochigi, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeo","lastName":"Kato","id":"37366544300"},{"name":"Taizo Suzuki","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Taizo","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"37534698000"},{"name":"Masaaki Ikehara","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaaki","lastName":"Ikehara","id":"37268595300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5537992","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"abstract":"Adaptive directional wavelet transform is an effective alternative of the traditional 2-D wavelet transform for image coding. It is able to transform an image adaptively along diagonal orientations as well as conventional vertical/horizontal directions. However, it requires to transmit transform direction information to the decoder side. For image coding at very low bitrates, the bit budget of the direction information degrades a reconstructed image quality. In this paper, a method to construct a scalable bitstream for transform directions is presented. We utilize the fact that the matrix yielded by transform direction indices still contains the original image characteristics. The matrix is transformed by a block-lifting based DCT, then encoded by SPIHT to yield a scalable bitstream. Our method is effective for very low bitrate image coding, and is comparable to the non-scalable one for middle-to-high bitrates.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5512009/5536941/05537992.pdf","startPage":"3044","endPage":"3047","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537992","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537992","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536941","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5537992","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direction scalability of adaptive directional wavelet transform: An approach using block-lifting based DCT and SPIHT","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scalability","Wavelet transforms","Discrete cosine transforms","Bit rate","Image coding","Image reconstruction","Energy resolution","Image resolution","Image quality","Image texture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","image coding","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction scalability","adaptive directional wavelet transform","block-lifting","DCT","SPIHT","image coding","transmit transform direction information","reconstructed image quality","scalable bitstream","middle-to-high bitrates"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5537992/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Direction scalability of adaptive directional wavelet transform: An approach using block-lifting based DCT and SPIHT","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5537992/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11463311","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direction scalability of adaptive directional wavelet transform: An approach using block-lifting based DCT and SPIHT","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"07773242.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059505S","chronDate":"May 30 2010-June 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5512009","isNumber":"5536941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5512009","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5536941","articleId":"5537992","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5538000,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroomi Hikawa","affiliation":["Department of Science and Engineering, Kansai University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroomi","lastName":"Hikawa","id":"37271164200"},{"name":"Taketo Namba","affiliation":["Department of Science and Engineering, Kansai University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Taketo","lastName":"Namba","id":"37543675500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5308-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5309-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5538000","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Read only memory","Frequency synthesizers","Circuits","Digital-to-frequency converters","Error correction","Adders","Clocks","Approximation methods","Picture archiving and communication systems","Table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","clocks","direct digital synthesis","error correction","phase convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase amplitude converter","direct digital frequency synthesizer","conditional shift operation","sawtooth signal","phase accumulator","error correction","CSO-PAC","signal purity","VHDL simulations","very high frequency clock","approximation method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5538000","abstract":"This paper proposes a new type of approximation method for sine wave and the proposed method is applied to phase amplitude converter (PAC) used in direct digital frequency synthesizer (DDFS).

A simplified opamp-sharing scheme between two successive pipelined stages is proposed to reduce the power consumption. For subsampling, a cost-effective fast input-tracking switch with high linearity is introduced to sample the input signal up to 75 MHz. A two-stage amplifier with hybrid frequency compensation is developed to achieve both high bandwidth and large swing with low power dissipation.

The success of these types of techniques has been traditionally achieved by using large sets of training data. However, analog data is expensive in terms of simulation time and hardware testing; therefore, achieving high modeling accuracy with limited datasets has become a challenge. The proposed sampling method dynamically forms datasets based on its selection of dominant support vectors, requiring less data while maintaining the same level of model accuracy. The rest of the modeling flow, including the learning and regression methods, is also discussed.

Physical control experiments show that this optimization strategy is feasible and effective.","doi":"10.1109/ICINDMA.2010.5538264","pdfPath":"/iel5/5523766/5538207/05538264.pdf","startPage":"491","endPage":"494","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 The 2nd International Conference on Industrial Mechatronics and Automation","publicationTitle":"2010 The 2nd International Conference on Industrial Mechatronics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICINDMA.2010.5538264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5538207","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chaos optimization neural network control for the stability of double inverted pendulum","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5538264/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30-31 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"Chaos optimization neural network control for the stability of double inverted pendulum","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11455786","publicationDate":"May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5538264/","conferenceDate":"30-31 May 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chaos optimization neural network control for the stability of double inverted pendulum","confLoc":"Wuhan","sourcePdf":"491.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071664S","chronDate":"30-31 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5523766","isNumber":"5538207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5523766","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5538207","articleId":"5538264","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5538304,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Hamid Tohidypour","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Reza Hamid","lastName":"Tohidypour","id":"37088154860"},{"name":"Seyyed Ali Seyyedsalehi","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyyed Ali","lastName":"Seyyedsalehi","id":"37542590800"},{"name":"Hossein Behbood","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Behbood","id":"37542591800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7656-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7653-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7655-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5538304","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":735},"abstract":"Although Wavelet Transformation has multi resolution properties, it is not optimized for speech recognition tasks.

Moreover, in the structure of proposed FIR filter the best previous designs for adders and multipliers are customized and failures of converter are mended. We have simulated and synthesized the proposed structure with VHDL and checked correctness of design via running random tests on the corresponding codes. The synthesis results show the proposed filter is fastest and in comparison with many state-of-the-arts designs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 The 2nd International Conference on Industrial

number of media access and routing protocols have been recently proposed for the use with such antennas, and have shown significant performance improvements over the Omni-directional case. This paper presents a novel MAC (Medium Access Control) protocols for nodes equipped with adaptive antenna array in ad hoc network. The protocol relies on the ability of antenna to use DOA (Direction-Of-Arrival) information to beamform by placing nulls in the direction of interferers thus maximizing SINR (Signal to Interference and noise ratio) at the receiver. In this work, we also compare the convergence of beam deflection towards a targeted receiver using the following four beamformers'. Matched Filter (MF), Minimum Variance Distortion less Response (MVDR), Minimum power distortion less response (MPDR), and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE). Finally, we show that MVDR algorithm has a fast convergence beam with wide beam width towards the receiver which targets the neighbor's transmitter node with maximum SNR. We perform Graphical User Interface (GUI) of MATLAB for an Adaptive Array Antenna Model to show the convergence of beam with their SNR for each scheme. We also compare the impulse response of MVDR vs. MPDR and the result shows that MVDR beamformer has higher impulse response than MPDR beamformer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5538324/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30-31 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11455845","htmlLink":"/document/5538324/","conferenceDate":"30-31 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"Neighbor selecting MAC protocol based on adaptive beamforming for ad hoc network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neighbor selecting MAC protocol based on adaptive beamforming for ad hoc network","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"248.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047624S","chronDate":"30-31 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5523766","isNumber":"5538207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5523766","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5538207","articleId":"5538324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5538331,"authors":[{"name":"Zeng Jiankui","affiliation":["Electronic information school, Chongqing University of science and technology, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Zeng Jiankui","id":"37297558900"},{"name":"Dong Ziming","affiliation":["Electronic information school, Chongqing University of science and technology, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Dong Ziming","id":"37394552100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7656-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7653-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7655-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5538331","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":618},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phased arrays","MIMO","Radar antennas","Radar detection","Detectors","Phase detection","Sensor arrays","Industrial electronics","Educational institutions","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO radar","phased array radar","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO radar","phased array radar","phased radar detection","nonideal factor","signal transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO radar","signal processing","phased array radar"]}],"abstract":"MIMO radar is a new radar technique developed recently.

We verified that the improvement of particle dispersibility in the nanoparticle composite process by combination of ultrasonic wave and centrifugal force could bring about lower permittivity of the nanocomposites, especially than that of unfilled epoxy material.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Permittivity characteristics of epoxy/alumina nanocomposite with high particle dispersibility by combining ultrasonic wave and centrifugal force","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2010.5539699","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/5539662/05539699.pdf","startPage":"1268","endPage":"1275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2010.5539699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539662","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539699","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539699/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2010","displayDocTitle":"Permittivity characteristics of epoxy/alumina nanocomposite with high particle dispersibility by combining ultrasonic wave and centrifugal force","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5539699/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","publicationDate":"August 2010","accessionNumber":"11496205","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Permittivity characteristics of epoxy/alumina nanocomposite with high particle dispersibility by combining ultrasonic wave and centrifugal force","sourcePdf":"p1268-kurimoto.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076934S","chronDate":"August  2010","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"5539662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5539662","articleId":"5539699","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5539705,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Using point-to-plate electrode configurations under AC voltages creepage discharge is studied for both single flashover breakdown and partial discharge induced failure modes. It is confirmed that the dielectric strength of oil gap will not be reduced with introducing dry new pressboard surface into the oil gap, indeed the flashover breakdown voltage is hardly compromised by introducing aged pressboard with up to 3% moisture. However, increased moisture content in pressboard reduces partial discharge inception voltage (PDIV) significantly, i.e. ~30% PDIV reduction for pressboard of ~3% moisture as compared with dry pressboard. More importantly, high moisture contents in pressboard increase PD activities in oil pores which allow gasses to be trapped inside to develop gaseous channels which eventually lead creepage discharge to breakdown.","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2010.5539705","startPage":"1327","endPage":"1335","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2010.5539705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539662","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/5539662/05539705.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Creepage discharge on insulation barriers in aged power transformers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539705/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Creepage discharge on insulation barriers in aged power transformers","volume":"17","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5539705/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11456566","publicationDate":"August 2010","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Creepage discharge on insulation barriers in aged power transformers","sourcePdf":"p1327-dai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075165S","chronDate":"August  2010","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"5539662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"5539662","articleId":"5539705","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":5539716,"authors":[{"name":"Melissa Duarte","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5595095/5539716/5539716-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Melissa Duarte was born in Cucuta, Colombia.

Our analytical and simulation results take into account channel-induced imperfections but do not take into account implementation-induced imperfections (which are difficult to model in a tractable way). Thus, we complement these results with experimental results that do take into account both channel and implementation-induced imperfections. This mixed approach provides a more complete picture of expected performance. As part of our study we develop a framework for Average Error Vector Magnitude Squared (AEVMS)-based analysis of beamforming MISO systems which facilitates comparison of analytical, simulation, and experimental results on the same scale. In addition, AEVMS allows fair comparison of experimental results obtained from different wireless testbeds. We derive novel expressions for the AEVMS of beamforming MISO systems and show how the AEVMS relates to important system characteristics like the diversity gain, coding gain, and error floor.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.072610.091720","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5595095/05539716.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5595095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.072610.091720","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"3214","endPage":"3225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamforming in MISO Systems: Empirical Results and EVM-Based Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539716","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming in MISO Systems: Empirical Results and EVM-Based Analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539716/","volume":"9","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5539716/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2010","accessionNumber":"11574426","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming in MISO Systems: Empirical Results and EVM-Based Analysis","sourcePdf":"3214-tw1010-duarte.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118335S","chronDate":"October  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5595095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5595095","articleId":"5539716","onlineDate":"05 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5539718,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Specifically, we consider a CRN wherein the number of SUs requesting channel access exceeds the number of available frequency bands and spatial modes. In such a setting, we propose a joint fast optimal resource allocation and beamforming algorithm to accommodate maximum possible number of SUs while satisfying quality of service (QoS) requirement for each admitted SU, transmit power limitation at the secondary network basestation (SNBS) and interference constraints imposed by the PUs. Recognizing that the original user maximization problem is a nondeterministic polynomial-time hard (NP), we use a mixed-integer programming framework to formulate the joint user maximization and beamforming problem. Subsequently, an optimal algorithm based on branch and bound (BnB) method has been proposed. In addition, we propose a suboptimal algorithm based on BnB method to reduce the complexity of the proposed algorithm. Specifically, the suboptimal algorithm has been developed based on the first feasible solution it achieves in the fast optimal BnB method. Simulation results have been provided to compare the performance of the optimal and suboptimal algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5595095/05539719.pdf","startPage":"3082","endPage":"3092","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.072610.090898","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.072610.090898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5595095","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539719","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Beamforming and User Maximization Techniques for Cognitive Radio Networks Based on Branch and Bound Method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Cognitive radio","Signal processing algorithms","Frequency","Resource management","Quality of service","Interference constraints","Chromium","AWGN","NP-hard problem"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel allocation","cognitive radio","computational complexity","integer programming","interference (signal)","quality of service","resource allocation","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint beamforming","user maximization techniques","cognitive radio networks","branch and bound method","cognitive users","underlay cognitive radio network","CRN","channel access","frequency bands","spatial modes","joint fast optimal resource allocation","beamforming algorithm","quality of service requirement","QoS requirement","secondary network basestation","SNBS","interference constraints","nondeterministic polynomial-time hard","mixed-integer programming framework","joint user maximization","optimal algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio networks","user maximization","resource allocation","beamforming","mixed-integer programming","branch and bound method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539719/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Joint Beamforming and User Maximization Techniques for Cognitive Radio Networks Based on Branch and Bound Method","volume":"9","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5539719/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2010","accessionNumber":"11574424","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Beamforming and User Maximization Techniques for Cognitive Radio Networks Based on Branch and Bound Method","sourcePdf":"3082-tw1010-cumanan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093769S","chronDate":"October  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5595095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5595095","articleId":"5539719","onlineDate":"05 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":5539720,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Zheng","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Aeronautics and Astronautics University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37534886100"},{"name":"Zulin Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Aeronautics and Astronautics University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zulin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404933700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"5539720","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1404},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"This letter presents the effects of frequency offset to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems based on fractional Fourier transform (FRFT-OFDM) in time-frequency selective fading channels.

A few distributed solutions to address this fundamental problem have been recently proposed. However, these solutions are not satisfactory. First, they are energy and memory demanding: A serious drawback for any protocol to be used in the WSN-resource-constrained environment. Further, they are vulnerable to the specific adversary models introduced in this paper. The contributions of this work are threefold. First, we analyze the desirable properties of a distributed mechanism for the detection of node replication attacks. Second, we show that the known solutions for this problem do not completely meet our requirements. Third, we propose a new self-healing, Randomized, Efficient, and Distributed (RED) protocol for the detection of node replication attacks, and we show that it satisfies the introduced requirements. Finally, extensive simulations show that our protocol is highly efficient in communication, memory, and computation; is much more effective than competing solutions in the literature; and is resistant to the new kind of attacks introduced in this paper, while other solutions are not.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloning","Wireless sensor networks","Protocols","Collaboration","Costs","Mechanical factors","Computational modeling","Resilience","Cryptography","Aggregates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protocols","telecommunication security","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clone attacks distributed detection","wireless sensor networks","WSN-resource-constrained environment","node replication attack detection","randomized efficient and distributed protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks security","node replication attack detection","distributed protocol","resilience","efficiency."]}],"doi":"10.1109/TDSC.2010.25","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/8858/5954680/05539762.pdf","startPage":"685","endPage":"698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5954680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDSC.2010.25","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Detection of Clone Attacks in Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539762","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Detection of Clone Attacks in Wireless Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539762/","volume":"8","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5539762/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12110497","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 August 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Detection of Clone Attacks in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"ttq2011050685.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145332S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"5954680","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"5954680","articleId":"5539762","onlineDate":"05 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5539768,"authors":[{"name":"Wladimir J. van der Laan","affiliation":["Johann Bernoulli Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Groningam, Groningen, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/5644739/5539768/5539768-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wladimir J. van der Laan received the MSc degree in computing science in 2005 from the University of Groningen, where he is currently working toward the PhD degree at the Johann Bernoulli Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science.

The three main hardware architectures for the 2D DWT (row-column, line-based, block-based) are shown to be unsuitable for a CUDA implementation. Our CUDA-specific design can be regarded as a hybrid method between the row-column and block-based methods. We achieve considerable speedups compared to an optimized CPU implementation and earlier non-CUDA-based GPU DWT methods, both for 2D images and 3D volume data. Additionally, memory usage can be reduced significantly compared to previous GPU DWT methods. The method is scalable and the fastest GPU implementation among the methods considered.

Common visual patterns generally share similar local features as well as similar spatial layout. In this paper these two types of information are integrated and encoded into the edges of a graph whose nodes represent potential correspondences, and the common visual patterns then correspond to those strongly connected subgraphs. All such strongly connected subgraphs correspond to large local maxima of a quadratic function on simplex, which is an approximate measure of the average intra-cluster affinity score of these subgraphs. We find all large local maxima of this function, thus discover all common visual patterns and recover the correct correspondences, using replicator equation and through a systematic way of initialization. The proposed algorithm possesses two characteristics: 1) robust to outliers, and 2) being able to discover all common visual patterns, no matter the mappings among the common visual patterns are one to one, one to many, or many to many. Extensive experiments on both point sets and real images demonstrate the properties of our proposed algorithm in terms of robustness to outliers, tolerance to large spatial deformations, and simplicity in implementation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539780/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11512616","htmlLink":"/document/5539780/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Common visual pattern discovery via spatially coherent correspondences","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Common visual pattern discovery via spatially coherent correspondences","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2050346.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081676S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539780","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5539788,"authors":[{"name":"Ankur Handa","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, UK"],"firstName":"Ankur","lastName":"Handa","id":"37546502600"},{"name":"Margarita Chli","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, UK"],"firstName":"Margarita","lastName":"Chli","id":"37546501900"},{"name":"Hauke Strasdat","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, UK"],"firstName":"Hauke","lastName":"Strasdat","id":"37295984800"},{"name":"Andrew J.

While these priors are often partially used post-hoc to resolve matching consensus in algorithms like RANSAC, it was recently shown that fully integrating them in an `Active Matching' (AM) approach permits efficient guided image processing with rigorous decisions guided by Information Theory. AM's weakness was that the overhead induced by intermediate Bayesian updates required meant poor scaling to cases where many correspondences were sought. In this paper we show that relaxation of the rigid probabilistic model of AM, where every feature measurement directly affects the prediction of every other, permits dramatically more scalable operation without affecting accuracy. We take a general graph-theoretic view of the structure of prior information in matching to sparsify and approximate the interconnections. We demonstrate the performance of two variations, CLAM and SubAM, in the context of sequential camera tracking. These algorithms are highly competitive with other techniques at matching hundreds of features per frame while retaining great intuitive appeal and the full probabilistic capability to digest prior information.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539788","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539788","startPage":"1546","endPage":"1553","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539788.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable active matching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Scalable active matching","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5539788/","accessionNumber":"11500341","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539788/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable active matching","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"197_1392.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062783S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5539802,"authors":[{"name":"Yasutaka Furukawa","affiliation":["Google, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Yasutaka","lastName":"Furukawa","id":"37402106400"},{"name":"Brian Curless","affiliation":["University of Washington, USA"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Curless","id":"37333354000"},{"name":"Steven M.

Our algorithm is based on a visual tracking decomposition scheme for the efficient design of observation and motion models as well as trackers. In our scheme, the observation model is decomposed into multiple basic observation models that are constructed by sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) of a set of feature templates. Each basic observation model covers a specific appearance of the object. The motion model is also represented by the combination of multiple basic motion models, each of which covers a different type of motion. Then the multiple basic trackers are designed by associating the basic observation models and the basic motion models, so that each specific tracker takes charge of a certain change in the object. All basic trackers are then integrated into one compound tracker through an interactive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (IMCMC) framework in which the basic trackers communicate with one another interactively while run in parallel. By exchanging information with others, each tracker further improves its performance, which results in increasing the whole performance of tracking. Experimental results show that our method tracks the object accurately and reliably in realistic videos where the appearance and motion are drastically changing over time.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539821","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539821.pdf","startPage":"1269","endPage":"1276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539821","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual tracking decomposition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539821","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539821/","displayDocTitle":"Visual tracking decomposition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500374","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5539821/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual tracking decomposition","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"162_1253.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087075S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"829","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539821","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5539823,"authors":[{"name":"Beyang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Beyang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37537340500"},{"name":"Stephen Gould","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Gould","id":"37408560000"},{"name":"Daphne Koller","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Daphne","lastName":"Koller","id":"37278029500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539823","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":252,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":3585},"abstract":"We consider the problem of estimating the depth of each pixel in a scene from a single monocular image. Unlike traditional approaches, which attempt to map from appearance features to depth directly, we first perform a semantic segmentation of the scene and use the semantic labels to guide the 3D reconstruction. This approach provides several advantages: By knowing the semantic class of a pixel or region, depth and geometry constraints can be easily enforced (e.g., \u201csky\u201d is far away and \u201cground\u201d is horizontal). In addition, depth can be more readily predicted by measuring the difference in appearance with respect to a given semantic class. For example, a tree will have more uniform appearance in the distance than it does close up. Finally, the incorporation of semantic features allows us to achieve state-of-the-art results with a significantly simpler model than previous works.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539823.pdf","startPage":"1253","endPage":"1260","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539823","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539823","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single image depth estimation from predicted semantic labels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Layout","Image reconstruction","Geometry","Computer science","Pixel","Predictive models","Computer vision","Roads","Image segmentation","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single image depth estimation","semantic label","single monocular image","semantic segmentation","3D reconstruction","geometry constraint"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539823/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Single image depth estimation from predicted semantic labels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5539823/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500472","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single image depth estimation from predicted semantic labels","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1601565.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06841S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"252","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539823","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":5539836,"authors":[{"name":"Joerg Liebelt","affiliation":["IW-SI, EADS Innovation Works, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Joerg","lastName":"Liebelt","id":"37546481000"},{"name":"Cordelia Schmid","affiliation":["LEAR, INRIA Grenoble, Montbonnot Saint Martin, France"],"firstName":"Cordelia","lastName":"Schmid","id":"37282990700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539836","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":111,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1308},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object detection","Solid modeling","Geometry","Training data","Image databases","Detectors","Spatial databases","Bicycles","Technological innovation","Image matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometry","image representation","object detection","pose estimation","solid modelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiview object class detection","3D geometric model","learning task","object appearance","spatial pyramid","real image","generative object representation","synthetic model","3D pose estimation","generic object class","3D object category datasets"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new approach for multi-view object class detection. Appearance and geometry are treated as separate learning tasks with different training data. Our approach uses a part model which discriminatively learns the object appearance with spatial pyramids from a database of real images, and encodes the 3D geometry of the object class with a generative representation built from a database of synthetic models. The geometric information is linked to the 2D training data and allows to perform an approximate 3D pose estimation for generic object classes. The pose estimation provides an efficient method to evaluate the likelihood of groups of 2D part detections with respect to a full 3D geometry model in order to disambiguate and prune 2D detections and to handle occlusions. In contrast to other methods, neither tedious manual part annotation of training images nor explicit appearance matching between synthetic and real training data is required, which results in high geometric fidelity and in increased flexibility. On the 3D Object Category datasets CAR and BICYCLE, the current state-of-the-art benchmark for 3D object detection, our approach outperforms previously published results for viewpoint estimation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-view object class detection with a 3D geometric model","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539836","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539836.pdf","startPage":"1688","endPage":"1695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539836","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Multi-view object class detection with a 3D geometric model","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5539836/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500504","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-view object class detection with a 3D geometric model","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2151423.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065249S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":5539837,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Yu Liu","affiliation":["University of Maryland,  College Park, USA"],"firstName":"Ming-Yu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37534374700"},{"name":"Oncel Tuzel","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Oncel","lastName":"Tuzel","id":"37295161800"},{"name":"Ashok Veeraraghavan","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Ashok","lastName":"Veeraraghavan","id":"37282938900"},{"name":"Rama Chellappa","affiliation":["University of Maryland,  College Park, USA"],"firstName":"Rama","lastName":"Chellappa","id":"37274537000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539837","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":116,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1761},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cost function","Image recognition","Object recognition","Shape measurement","Image segmentation","Humans","Educational institutions","Robustness","Art","Velocity measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","image matching","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast directional chamfer matching","object localization problem","single hand-drawn example","gallery of shapes","object model","shape matching algorithms","computational time","edge orientation information","piecewise smooth","cost variation","sublinear time algorithm","directional chamfer matching score","3D distance transforms","directional integral images","smooth cost function","cost distribution"]}],"abstract":"We study the object localization problem in images given a single hand-drawn example or a gallery of shapes as the object model. Although many shape matching algorithms have been proposed for the problem over the decades, chamfer matching remains to be the preferred method when speed and robustness are considered. In this paper, we significantly improve the accuracy of chamfer matching while reducing the computational time from linear to sublinear (shown empirically). Specifically, we incorporate edge orientation information in the matching algorithm such that the resulting cost function is piecewise smooth and the cost variation is tightly bounded. Moreover, we present a sublinear time algorithm for exact computation of the directional chamfer matching score using techniques from 3D distance transforms and directional integral images. In addition, the smooth cost function allows to bound the cost distribution of large neighborhoods and skip the bad hypotheses within. Experiments show that the proposed approach improves the speed of the original chamfer matching upto an order of 45\u00d7, and it is much faster than many state of art techniques while the accuracy is comparable.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast directional chamfer matching","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539837","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539837.pdf","startPage":"1696","endPage":"1703","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539837","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539837/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Fast directional chamfer matching","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5539837/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500505","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast directional chamfer matching","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2161483.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.127265S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5539838,"authors":[{"name":"Michael M.

Recently, heat kernel signature was introduced as an intrinsic local shape descriptor based on diffusion scale-space analysis. In this paper, we develop a scale-invariant version of the heat kernel descriptor. Our construction is based on a logarithmically sampled scale-space in which shape scaling corresponds, up to a multiplicative constant, to a translation. This translation is undone using the magnitude of the Fourier transform. The proposed scale-invariant local descriptors can be used in the bag-of-features framework for shape retrieval in the presence of transformations such as isometric deformations, missing data, topological noise, and global and local scaling.

In this paper, we present a new patch-based video denoising algorithm capable of removing serious mixed noise from the video data. By grouping similar patches in both spatial and temporal domain, we formulate the problem of removing mixed noise as a low-rank matrix completion problem, which leads to a denoising scheme without strong assumptions on the statistical properties of noise. The resulting nuclear norm related minimization problem can be efficiently solved by many recently developed methods. The robustness and effectiveness of our proposed denoising algorithm on removing mixed noise, e.g. heavy Gaussian noise mixed with impulsive noise, is validated in the experiments and our proposed approach compares favorably against some existing video denoising algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539849/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11500534","htmlLink":"/document/5539849/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Robust video denoising using low rank matrix completion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust video denoising using low rank matrix completion","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2280277.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110889S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"251","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5539853,"authors":[{"name":"Nils Hasler","affiliation":["Max Planck-Institut fur Informatik, Germany","Saarland University, Germany","Weta Digital"],"firstName":"Nils","lastName":"Hasler","id":"37294528300"},{"name":"Hanno Ackermann","affiliation":["Leibniz University Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Hanno","lastName":"Ackermann","id":"37546303400"},{"name":"Bodo Rosenhahn","affiliation":["Leibniz University Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Bodo","lastName":"Rosenhahn","id":"37294525800"},{"name":"Thorsten Thorm\u00e4hlen","affiliation":["Max Planck-Institut fur Informatik, Germany","Max-Planck-Institut Informatik (MPII)"],"firstName":"Thorsten","lastName":"Thorm\u00e4hlen","id":"37397604800"},{"name":"Hans-Peter Seidel","affiliation":["Max Planck-Institut fur Informatik, Germany","Max-Planck-Institut Informatik (MPII)"],"firstName":"Hans-Peter","lastName":"Seidel","id":"37271851300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539853","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":64,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":714},"abstract":"In this paper we propose a multilinear model of human pose and body shape which is estimated from a database of registered 3D body scans in different poses.

In this paper, we propose a stochastic approximation Monte Carlo (SAMC) based tracking scheme for abrupt motion problem in Bayesian filtering framework. In our tracking scheme, the particle weight is dynamically estimated by learning the density of states in simulations, and thus the local-trap problem suffered by the conventional MCMC sampling-based methods could be essentially avoided. In addition, we design an adaptive SAMC sampling method to further speed up the sampling process for tracking of abrupt motion. It combines the SAMC sampling and a density grid based statistical predictive model, to give a data-mining mode embedded global sampling scheme. It is computationally efficient and effective in dealing with abrupt motion difficulties. We compare it with alternative tracking methods. Extensive experimental results showed the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm in dealing with various types of abrupt motions.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539856","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539856","startPage":"1847","endPage":"1854","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539856.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Abrupt motion tracking via adaptive stochastic approximation Monte Carlo sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Abrupt motion tracking via adaptive stochastic approximation Monte Carlo sampling","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5539856/","accessionNumber":"11500543","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539856/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Abrupt motion tracking via adaptive stochastic approximation Monte Carlo sampling","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"235_0723.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054055S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5539857,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Yao","affiliation":["Visualization and Computer Vision Lab, GE Global Research Center, Niskayuna, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Yao","id":"37275325200"},{"name":"Gianfranco Doretto","affiliation":["Visualization and Computer Vision Lab, GE Global Research Center, Niskayuna, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Gianfranco","lastName":"Doretto","id":"37330622600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539857","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":173,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":4249},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Boosting","Machine learning algorithms","Computer vision","Machine learning","Data visualization","Algorithm design and analysis","Object detection","Probability distribution","Testing","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transfer learning","brute force leveraging","multisource TrAdaBoost","TaskTrAdaBoost","object category recognition","object detection","boosting framework"]}],"abstract":"Transfer learning allows leveraging the knowledge of source domains, available a priori, to help training a classifier for a target domain, where the available data is scarce. The effectiveness of the transfer is affected by the relationship between source and target. Rather than improving the learning, brute force leveraging of a source poorly related to the target may decrease the classifier performance. One strategy to reduce this negative transfer is to import knowledge from multiple sources to increase the chance of finding one source closely related to the target. This work extends the boosting framework for transferring knowledge from multiple sources. Two new algorithms, MultiSource-TrAdaBoost, and TaskTrAdaBoost, are introduced, analyzed, and applied for object category recognition and specific object detection. The experiments demonstrate their improved performance by greatly reducing the negative transfer as the number of sources increases. TaskTrAdaBoost is a fast algorithm enabling rapid retraining over new targets.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539857","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539857.pdf","startPage":"1855","endPage":"1862","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Boosting for transfer learning with multiple sources","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539857","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539857/","displayDocTitle":"Boosting for transfer learning with multiple sources","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500544","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5539857/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Boosting for transfer learning with multiple sources","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2360789.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055866S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"173","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539857","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5539868,"authors":[{"name":"Armand Joulin","affiliation":["INRIA, Paris, France","Ecole Normale Sup\u00e8rieure, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Armand","lastName":"Joulin","id":"37546393700"},{"name":"Francis Bach","affiliation":["INRIA, Paris, France","Laboratoire d'Informatique de l'Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, ENS/INRIA/CNRS UMR 8548, France"],"firstName":"Francis","lastName":"Bach","id":"37281561400"},{"name":"Jean Ponce","affiliation":["Ecole Normale Sup\u00e8rieure, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Ponce","id":"37282647000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539868","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":268,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":2211},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Computer vision","Kernel","Object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinatorial mathematics","computer vision","image segmentation","object recognition","optimisation","pattern classification","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discriminative clustering framework","image cosegmentation","unsupervised segmentation","computer vision","bottom-up image segmentation","kernel methods","object recognition","foreground labels","background labels","supervised classifier","combinatorial optimization problem","continuous convex optimization problem"]}],"abstract":"Purely bottom-up, unsupervised segmentation of a single image into foreground and background regions remains a challenging task for computer vision. Co-segmentation is the problem of simultaneously dividing multiple images into regions (segments) corresponding to different object classes. In this paper, we combine existing tools for bottom-up image segmentation such as normalized cuts, with kernel methods commonly used in object recognition. These two sets of techniques are used within a discriminative clustering framework: the goal is to assign foreground/background labels jointly to all images, so that a supervised classifier trained with these labels leads to maximal separation of the two classes. In practice, we obtain a combinatorial optimization problem which is relaxed to a continuous convex optimization problem, that can itself be solved efficiently for up to dozens of images. We illustrate the proposed method on images with very similar foreground objects, as well as on more challenging problems with objects with higher intra-class variations.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539868","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539868.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539868","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","startPage":"1943","endPage":"1950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discriminative clustering for image co-segmentation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539868","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Discriminative clustering for image co-segmentation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539868/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5539868/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500575","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminative clustering for image co-segmentation","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2471947.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067157S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"268","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5539869,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Kuettel","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Kuettel","id":"37546468200"},{"name":"Michael D.

To this end we employ Dependent Dirichlet Processes to learn an arbitrary number of infinite Hidden Markov Models.

First, we propose a new aligned space-time pyramid matching method to measure the distances between two video clips, where each video clip is divided into space-time volumes over multiple levels. We calculate the pair-wise distances between any two volumes and further integrate the information from different volumes with Integer-flow Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to explicitly align the volumes. Second, we propose a new cross-domain learning method in order to 1) fuse the information from multiple pyramid levels and features (i.e., space-time feature and static SIFT feature) and 2) cope with the considerable variation in feature distributions between videos from two domains (i.e., web domain and consumer domain). For each pyramid level and each type of local features, we train a set of SVM classifiers based on the combined training set from two domains using multiple base kernels of different kernel types and parameters, which are fused with equal weights to obtain an average classifier. Finally, we propose a cross-domain learning method, referred to as Adaptive Multiple Kernel Learning (A-MKL), to learn an adapted classifier based on multiple base kernels and the prelearned average classifiers by minimizing both the structural risk functional and the mismatch between data distributions from two domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework that requires only a small number of labeled consumer videos by leveraging web data.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539870.pdf","startPage":"1959","endPage":"1966","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539870","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual event recognition in videos by learning from web data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Videos","YouTube","Kernel","Learning systems","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Digital cameras","Humans","Training data","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided instruction","feature extraction","image recognition","Internet","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual event recognition","Web data","consumer domain videos","YouTube","space-time pyramid matching method","video clips","video clip","Earth mover distance","cross-domain learning method","static SIFT feature","SVM classifiers","adaptive multiple kernel learning","A-MKL","structural risk functional"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539870/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Visual event recognition in videos by learning from web data","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5539870/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500577","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual event recognition in videos by learning from web data","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2491358.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079619S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539870","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5539872,"authors":[{"name":"Vijay Mahadevan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Mahadevan","id":"37282151300"},{"name":"Weixin Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Weixin","lastName":"Li","id":"37537041700"},{"name":"Viral Bhalodia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Viral","lastName":"Bhalodia","id":"37546401600"},{"name":"Nuno Vasconcelos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Nuno","lastName":"Vasconcelos","id":"37282663400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539872","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":642,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":6776},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539872","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Layout","Image motion analysis","Video sequences","Histograms","Linear discriminant analysis","Hidden Markov models","Computer vision","Surveillance","Cameras","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","image segmentation","image sequences","image texture","security of data","statistical analysis","video signal processing","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","crowded scene","localized video representation","spatial abnormality","texture anomaly","outlier anomaly","temporal anomaly","video sequence"]}],"abstract":"A novel framework for anomaly detection in crowded scenes is presented.

The model for normal crowd behavior is based on mixtures of dynamic textures and outliers under this model are labeled as anomalies. Temporal anomalies are equated to events of low-probability, while spatial anomalies are handled using discriminant saliency.

To learn an effective action classifier, most of the previous approaches rely on enough training labels. When being required to recognize the action in a different dataset, these approaches have to re-train the model using new labels. However, labeling video sequences is a very tedious and time-consuming task, especially when detailed spatial locations and time durations are required. In this paper, we propose an adaptive action detection approach which reduces the requirement of training labels and is able to handle the task of cross-dataset action detection with few or no extra training labels. Our approach combines model adaptation and action detection into a Maximum a Posterior (MAP) estimation framework, which explores the spatial-temporal coherence of actions and makes good use of the prior information which can be obtained without supervision. Our approach obtains state-of-the-art results on KTH action dataset using only 50% of the training labels in tradition approaches. Furthermore, we show that our approach is effective for the cross-dataset detection which adapts the model trained on KTH to two other challenging datasets.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539875","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539875.pdf","startPage":"1998","endPage":"2005","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-dataset action detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539875","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539875/","displayDocTitle":"Cross-dataset action detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500582","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5539875/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-dataset action detection","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2540506.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073443S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5539879,"authors":[{"name":"Weilong Yang","affiliation":["School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Weilong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37402761100"},{"name":"Yang Wang","affiliation":["School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407552000"},{"name":"Greg Mori","affiliation":["School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Greg","lastName":"Mori","id":"37279179700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539879","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":119,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":978},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image recognition","Humans","Legged locomotion","Arm","Shape","Histograms","Image analysis","Tracking","Torso","Head"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image motion analysis","pose estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human action recognition","still images","latent poses","pose estimation","adhoc fashion"]}],"abstract":"We consider the problem of recognizing human actions from still images.

However, existing methods typically rely on a predefined spatial binning of the local descriptors to impose spatial information beyond a pure \u201cbag-of-words\u201d model, and thus may fail to capture the most informative space-time relationships. We propose to learn the shapes of space-time feature neighborhoods that are most discriminative for a given action category. Given a set of training videos, our method first extracts local motion and appearance features, quantizes them to a visual vocabulary, and then forms candidate neighborhoods consisting of the words associated with nearby points and their orientation with respect to the central interest point. Rather than dictate a particular scaling of the spatial and temporal dimensions to determine which points are near, we show how to learn the class-specific distance functions that form the most informative configurations. Descriptors for these variable-sized neighborhoods are then recursively mapped to higher-level vocabularies, producing a hierarchy of space-time configurations at successively broader scales. Our approach yields state-of-the-art performance on the UCF Sports and KTH datasets.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539881","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539881.pdf","startPage":"2046","endPage":"2053","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning a hierarchy of discriminative space-time neighborhood features for human action recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539881/","displayDocTitle":"Learning a hierarchy of discriminative space-time neighborhood features for human action recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500589","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5539881/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning a hierarchy of discriminative space-time neighborhood features for human action recognition","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2601470.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074968S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"330","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5539882,"authors":[{"name":"Shandong Wu","affiliation":["Computer Vision Lab, University of Central Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Shandong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37539725200"},{"name":"Brian E.

The novelty is revealed in three aspects. First, it is a unique utilization of particle trajectories for modeling crowded scenes, in which we propose new and efficient representative trajectories for modeling arbitrarily complicated crowd flows. Second, chaotic dynamics are introduced into the crowd context to characterize complicated crowd motions by regulating a set of chaotic invariant features, which are reliably computed and used for detecting anomalies. Third, a probabilistic framework for anomaly detection and localization is formulated. The overall work-flow begins with particle advection based on optical flow. Then particle trajectories are clustered to obtain representative trajectories for a crowd flow. Next, the chaotic dynamics of all representative trajectories are extracted and quantified using chaotic invariants known as maximal Lyapunov exponent and correlation dimension. Probabilistic model is learned from these chaotic feature set, and finally, a maximum likelihood estimation criterion is adopted to identify a query video of a scene as normal or abnormal. Furthermore, an effective anomaly localization algorithm is designed to locate the position and size of an anomaly. Experiments are conducted on known crowd data set, and results show that our method achieves higher accuracy in anomaly detection and can effectively localize anomalies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539882/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5539882/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11500586","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Chaotic invariants of Lagrangian particle trajectories for anomaly detection in crowded scenes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chaotic invariants of Lagrangian particle trajectories for anomaly detection in crowded scenes","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2611482.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091856S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"250","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539882","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5539883,"authors":[{"name":"Angela Yao","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Angela","lastName":"Yao","id":"37547274900"},{"name":"Juergen Gall","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Juergen","lastName":"Gall","id":"37393846400"},{"name":"Luc Van Gool","affiliation":["KU Leuven, Belgium","ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Luc","lastName":"Van Gool","id":"37277167600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539883","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":163,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":1560},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voting","Object detection","Video sequences","Humans","Vegetation mapping","Detectors","Video sharing","Image motion analysis","Assembly","Particle filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient methods","Hough transforms","image classification","image recognition","image sequences","probability","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hough transform","voting framework","action recognition","human action classification","random trees","densely-sampled feature patches","spatio-temporal-action Hough space","discriminative multiclass codebook","probabilistic manner","gradient feature","optical flow feature","human action localization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539883","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539883","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539883.pdf","startPage":"2061","endPage":"2068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hough transform-based voting framework for action recognition","abstract":"We present a method to classify and localize human actions in video using a Hough transform voting framework.

Using low-level features such as gradients and optical flow, we demonstrate that Hough-voting can achieve state-of-the-art performance on several datasets covering a wide range of action-recognition scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539883/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5539883/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500608","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Hough transform-based voting framework for action recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hough transform-based voting framework for action recognition","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2621646.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09196S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"163","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5539888,"authors":[{"name":"Tae Hoon Kim","affiliation":["Department of EECS,  ASRI, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Tae Hoon Kim","id":"38248019100"},{"name":"Kyoung Mu Lee","affiliation":["Department of EECS,  ASRI, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kyoung Mu Lee","id":"37407638800"},{"name":"Sang Uk Lee","affiliation":["Department of EECS,  ASRI, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sang Uk Lee","id":"37281137800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539888","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":505},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning full pairwise affinities for spectral segmentation","abstract":"This paper studies the problem of learning a full range of pairwise affinities gained by integrating local grouping cues for spectral segmentation. The overall quality of the spectral segmentation depends mainly on the pairwise pixel affinities. By employing a semi-supervised learning technique, optimal affinities are learnt from the test image without iteration. We first construct a multi-layer graph with pixels and regions, generated by the mean shift algorithm, as nodes. By applying the semi-supervised learning strategy to this graph, we can estimate the intra- and inter-layer affinities between all pairs of nodes together. These pair-wise affinities are then used to simultaneously cluster all pixel and region nodes into visually coherent groups across all layers in a single multi-layer framework of Normalized Cuts. Our algorithm provides high-quality segmentations with object details by directly incorporating the full range connections in the spectral framework. Since the full affinity matrix is defined by the inverse of a sparse matrix, its eigen-decomposition is efficiently computed. The experimental results on Berkeley and MSRC image databases demonstrate the relevance and accuracy of our algorithm as compared to existing popular methods.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539888.pdf","startPage":"2101","endPage":"2108","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539888","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539888","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539888","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Pixel","Clustering algorithms","Semisupervised learning","Sparse matrices","Testing","Image databases","Humans","Partitioning algorithms","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectral segmentation","semisupervised learning technique","multilayer graph","sparse matrix"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539888/","displayDocTitle":"Learning full pairwise affinities for spectral segmentation","accessionNumber":"11500613","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5539888/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning full pairwise affinities for spectral segmentation","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"267_1254.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06442S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539888","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5539893,"authors":[{"name":"Matthias Grundmann","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Grundmann","id":"37546338900"},{"name":"Vivek Kwatra","affiliation":["Google Research, Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Vivek","lastName":"Kwatra","id":"37300430200"},{"name":"Mei Han","affiliation":["Google Research, Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mei","lastName":"Han","id":"37272698600"},{"name":"Irfan Essa","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Irfan","lastName":"Essa","id":"37282740400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539893","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":440,"citationCountPatent":21,"totalDownloads":3740},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spatiotemporal phenomena","Video sequences","Iterative algorithms","Tree graphs","Image motion analysis","Scalability","Streaming media"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","image sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph based video segmentation","spatiotemporal segmentation","video sequence","hierarchical approach","optical flow"]}],"abstract":"We present an efficient and scalable technique for spatiotemporal segmentation of long video sequences using a hierarchical graph-based algorithm. We begin by over-segmenting a volumetric video graph into space-time regions grouped by appearance. We then construct a \u201cregion graph\u201d over the obtained segmentation and iteratively repeat this process over multiple levels to create a tree of spatio-temporal segmentations. This hierarchical approach generates high quality segmentations, which are temporally coherent with stable region boundaries, and allows subsequent applications to choose from varying levels of granularity. We further improve segmentation quality by using dense optical flow to guide temporal connections in the initial graph. We also propose two novel approaches to improve the scalability of our technique: (a) a parallel out-of-core algorithm that can process volumes much larger than an in-core algorithm, and (b) a clip-based processing algorithm that divides the video into overlapping clips in time, and segments them successively while enforcing consistency. We demonstrate hierarchical segmentations on video shots as long as 40 seconds, and even support a streaming mode for arbitrarily long videos, albeit without the ability to process them hierarchically.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient hierarchical graph-based video segmentation","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539893","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539893.pdf","startPage":"2141","endPage":"2148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539893","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539893/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Efficient hierarchical graph-based video segmentation","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5539893/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500618","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient hierarchical graph-based video segmentation","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"272_1205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05695S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"440","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":5539896,"authors":[{"name":"Kaiming He","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Kaiming","lastName":"He","id":"37085360867"},{"name":"Jian Sun","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Sun","id":"37407525400"},{"name":"Xiaoou Tang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoou","lastName":"Tang","id":"37280008500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539896","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":95,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1366},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539896","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Laplace equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphics","computer vision","image matching","image segmentation","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image matting","computer vision","computer graphic","sparse matrix","kernel matting Laplacian matrix","linear system","user interaction","KD tree trimap segmentation technique"]}],"abstract":"Image matting is of great importance in both computer vision and graphics applications. Most existing state-of-the-art techniques rely on large sparse matrices such as the matting Laplacian. However, solving these linear systems is often time-consuming, which is unfavored for the user interaction. In this paper, we propose a fast method for high quality matting. We first derive an efficient algorithm to solve a large kernel matting Laplacian. A large kernel propagates information more quickly and may improve the matte quality. To further reduce running time, we also use adaptive kernel sizes by a KD-tree trimap segmentation technique. A variety of experiments show that our algorithm provides high quality results and is 5 to 20 times faster than previous methods.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539896","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539896.pdf","startPage":"2165","endPage":"2172","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast matting using large kernel matting Laplacian matrices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Fast matting using large kernel matting Laplacian matrices","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5539896/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500622","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539896/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast matting using large kernel matting Laplacian matrices","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2751471.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063357S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5539905,"authors":[{"name":"Olga Barinova","affiliation":["Moscow State University, Russia"],"firstName":"Olga","lastName":"Barinova","id":"37398706600"},{"name":"Victor Lempitsky","affiliation":["University of Oxford, UK"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Lempitsky","id":"37332794000"},{"name":"Pushmeet Kohli","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Pushmeet","lastName":"Kohli","id":"37408096000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539905","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":65,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":863},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object detection","Voting","Image edge detection","Object recognition","Pixel","Computer vision","Image converters","Fires","Rendering (computer graphics)","Torso"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","edge detection","Hough transforms","object detection","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple object instances detection","Hough transforms","probabilistic framework","straight line detection"]}],"abstract":"To detect multiple objects of interest, the methods based on Hough transform use non-maxima supression or mode seeking in order to locate and to distinguish peaks in Hough images. Such postprocessing requires tuning of extra parameters and is often fragile, especially when objects of interest tend to be closely located. In the paper, we develop a new probabilistic framework that is in many ways related to Hough transform, sharing its simplicity and wide applicability. At the same time, the framework bypasses the problem of multiple peaks identification in Hough images, and permits detection of multiple objects without invoking nonmaximum suppression heuristics. As a result, the experiments demonstrate a significant improvement in detection accuracy both for the classical task of straight line detection and for a more modern category-level (pedestrian) detection problem.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539905","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539905.pdf","startPage":"2233","endPage":"2240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On detection of multiple object instances using hough transforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539905/","displayDocTitle":"On detection of multiple object instances using hough transforms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500649","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5539905/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On detection of multiple object instances using hough transforms","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2841901.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055219S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5539906,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro F.

Such thresholds provide theoretical guarantees on the performance of the cascade method and can be computed from a small sample of positive examples.

Our experiments show that the proposed representation is significantly more accurate at identifying food than existing methods.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539907","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539907.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","startPage":"2249","endPage":"2256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Food recognition using statistics of pairwise local features","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539907","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Food recognition using statistics of pairwise local features","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539907/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500651","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5539907/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Food recognition using statistics of pairwise local features","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2861163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048897S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5539908,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Hinterstoisser","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science,  CAMP, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Hinterstoisser","id":"37546484600"},{"name":"Vincent Lepetit","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Lepetit","id":"37281250600"},{"name":"Slobodan Ilic","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science,  CAMP, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Slobodan","lastName":"Ilic","id":"37266931500"},{"name":"Pascal Fua","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Fua","id":"37281288800"},{"name":"Nassir Navab","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science,  CAMP, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Nassir","lastName":"Navab","id":"37282965500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539908","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":132,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1433},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object detection","Computer vision","Robustness","Distortion measurement","Runtime","Histograms","Computer science","Laboratories","Testing","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient methods","image texture","object detection","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dominant orientation template representation","texture-less object","real-time 3D object detection","dominant gradient orientation","branch-and-bound approach"]}],"abstract":"We present a method for real-time 3D object detection that does not require a time consuming training stage, and can handle untextured objects.

As kernel machines are difficult to scale to large training sets, it has been proposed to perform an explicit mapping of the data and to learn directly linear classifiers in the new space. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning image categorizers on large image sets (e.g. > 100k images) using bag-of-visual-words (BOV) image representations and Support Vector Machine classifiers. We experiment with three approaches to BOV embedding: 1) kernel PCA (kPCA), 2) a modified kPCA we propose for additive kernels and 3) random projections for shift-invariant kernels. We report experiments on 3 datasets: Cal-tech101, VOC07 and ImageNet. An important conclusion is that simply square-rooting BOV vectors - which corresponds to an exact mapping for the Bhattacharyya kernel - already leads to large improvements, often quite close to the best results obtained with additive kernels. Another conclusion is that, although it is possible to go beyond additive kernels, the embedding comes at a much higher cost.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539914.pdf","endPage":"2304","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-scale image categorization with explicit data embedding","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539914","startPage":"2297","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539914","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Large-scale image categorization with explicit data embedding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539914/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11500658","publicationDate":"June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5539914/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-scale image categorization with explicit data embedding","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2921250.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064725S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5539924,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Farhadi","affiliation":["University of Illinois,  Urbana Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Farhadi","id":"37410280900"},{"name":"Ian Endres","affiliation":["University of Illinois,  Urbana Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Ian","lastName":"Endres","id":"37393145500"},{"name":"Derek Hoiem","affiliation":["University of Illinois,  Urbana Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Derek","lastName":"Hoiem","id":"37282746800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539924","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":115,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":496},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Animals","Object detection","Horses","Leg","Dogs","Object recognition","Knowledge transfer","Road vehicles","Graphical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["attribute-centric recognition","cross-category generalization","annotation","visual basis"]}],"abstract":"We propose an approach to find and describe objects within broad domains.

In this way, robustness against very low resolution, occlusions and pose, viewpoint and illumination changes is achieved. The approach applies to situations where the number of candidates varies continuously, considering single images or bunch of frames for each individual.

The model is inspired by a few well acknowledged biological facts. To compute the saliency spots of an image, the model first extracts a number of sub-band feature maps using learned sparse codes. It adopts a fully-connected graph representation for each feature map, and runs random walks on the graphs to simulate the signal/information transmission among the interconnected neurons. We propose a new visual saliency measure called Site Entropy Rate (SER) to compute the average information transmitted from a node (neuron) to all the others during the random walk on the graphs/network. This saliency definition also explains the center-surround mechanism from computation aspect. We further extend our model to spatial-temporal domain so as to detect salient spots in videos. To evaluate the proposed model, we do extensive experiments on psychological stimuli, two well known image data sets, as well as a public video dataset. The experiments demonstrate encouraging results that the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance of saliency detection in both still images and videos.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measuring visual saliency by Site Entropy Rate","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539927","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539927.pdf","startPage":"2368","endPage":"2375","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539927","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539927/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Measuring visual saliency by Site Entropy Rate","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5539927/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500690","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measuring visual saliency by Site Entropy Rate","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3010213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063397S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5539928,"authors":[{"name":"Michael M.

Learning similarities specific to a certain perception task from a set of examples has been shown advantageous in various computer vision and pattern recognition problems. In many important applications, the data that one needs to compare come from different representations or modalities, and the similarity between such data operates on objects that may have different and often incommensurable structure and dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a framework for supervised similarity learning based on embedding the input data from two arbitrary spaces into the Hamming space. The mapping is expressed as a binary classification problem with positive and negative examples, and can be efficiently learned using boosting algorithms. The utility and efficiency of such a generic approach is demonstrated on several challenging applications including cross-representation shape retrieval and alignment of multi-modal medical images.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539928","startPage":"3594","endPage":"3601","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539928.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data fusion through cross-modality metric learning using similarity-sensitive hashing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539928/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Data fusion through cross-modality metric learning using similarity-sensitive hashing","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11500691","publicationDate":"June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5539928/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data fusion through cross-modality metric learning using similarity-sensitive hashing","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4571652.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088941S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"220","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539928","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5539933,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Wing Tai","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yu-Wing","lastName":"Tai","id":"37268393300"},{"name":"Shuaicheng Liu","affiliation":["National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Shuaicheng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37538555200"},{"name":"Michael S.

Under large magnification, however, textured regions become blurred and appear homogenous, resulting in a super-resolution image that looks unnatural. Alternatively, learning-based SR approaches use a large database of exemplar images for \u201challucinating\u201d detail. The quality of the upsampled image, especially about edges, is dependent on the suitability of the training images. This paper aims to combine the benefits of edge-directed SR with those of learning-based SR. In particular, we propose an approach to extend edge-directed super-resolution to include detail from an image/texture example provided by the user (e.g., from the Internet). A significant benefit of our approach is that only a single exemplar image is required to supply the missing detail - strong edges are obtained in the SR image even if they are not present in the example image due to the combination of the edge-directed approach. In addition, we can achieve quality results at very large magnification, which is often problematic for both edge-directed and learning-based approaches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Super resolution using edge prior and single image detail synthesis","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539933","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539933.pdf","startPage":"2400","endPage":"2407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539933","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539933","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539933/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Super resolution using edge prior and single image detail synthesis","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5539933/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500696","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Super resolution using edge prior and single image detail synthesis","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3050212.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098881S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"183","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539933","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-17"},{"_id":5539934,"authors":[{"name":"Yanan Liu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, University of Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Yanan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37537587500"},{"name":"Fei Wu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, University of Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Wu","id":"37272891600"},{"name":"Zhihua Zhang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, University of Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Zhihua","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405436500"},{"name":"Yueting Zhuang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, University of Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Yueting","lastName":"Zhuang","id":"37275441700"},{"name":"Shuicheng Yan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Shuicheng","lastName":"Yan","id":"37272225300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539934","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":539},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Computer vision","Sparse matrices","Pattern recognition","Image reconstruction","Image classification","Linear regression","Educational institutions","Computer science","Image databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","matrix decomposition","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse representation","nonnegative curds","whey","computer vision","nonnegative representation","regression-type nonnegative matrix factorization","discriminant analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539934","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539934","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539934.pdf","startPage":"3578","endPage":"3585","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse representation using nonnegative curds and whey","abstract":"It has been of great interest to find sparse and/or nonnegative representations in computer vision literature.

In the first stage we consider a set of sparse and nonnegative representations of a test image, each of which is a linear combination of the images within a certain class, by solving a set of regression-type nonnegative matrix factorization problems. In the second stage we incorporate these representations into a new sparse and nonnegative representation by using the group nonnegative garrote. This procedure is particularly appropriate for discriminant analysis owing to its supervised and nonnegativity nature in sparsity pursuing. Experiments on several benchmark face databases and Caltech 101 image dataset demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our nonnegative curds and whey method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539934/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5539934/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500697","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sparse representation using nonnegative curds and whey","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse representation using nonnegative curds and whey","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4551089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063338S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539934","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5539938,"authors":[{"name":"Yunpeng Li","affiliation":["Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yunpeng","lastName":"Li","id":"37405735700"},{"name":"Sing Bing Kang","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Sing Bing","lastName":"Kang","id":"37290242800"},{"name":"Neel Joshi","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Neel","lastName":"Joshi","id":"37270908500"},{"name":"Steve M.

We discover that \u201cclassical\u201d flow formulations perform surprisingly well when combined with modern optimization and implementation techniques. Moreover, we find that while median filtering of intermediate flow fields during optimization is a key to recent performance gains, it leads to higher energy solutions. To understand the principles behind this phenomenon, we derive a new objective that formalizes the median filtering heuristic. This objective includes a nonlocal term that robustly integrates flow estimates over large spatial neighborhoods. By modifying this new term to include information about flow and image boundaries we develop a method that ranks at the top of the Middlebury benchmark.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","startPage":"2432","endPage":"2439","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539939.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secrets of optical flow estimation and their principles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539939/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5539939/","displayDocTitle":"Secrets of optical flow estimation and their principles","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500702","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secrets of optical flow estimation and their principles","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3090477.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102595S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"737","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539939","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5539941,"authors":[{"name":"Shaojie Zhuo","affiliation":["School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Shaojie","lastName":"Zhuo","id":"37531677100"},{"name":"Dong Guo","affiliation":["School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Guo","id":"37532174200"},{"name":"Terence Sim","affiliation":["School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Terence","lastName":"Sim","id":"37268065900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539941","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":766},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Testing","Face recognition","Nearest neighbor searches","Kernel","Principal component analysis","Independent component analysis","Embedded computing","Computer vision","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deconvolution","gradient methods","image motion analysis","image restoration","image sensors","maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust flash deblurring","motion blur","camera shake","low-light photography","hand-held camera","sharp image","flash image","maximum-a-posteriori problem","flash gradient constraint","kernel estimation","nonblind deconvolution"]}],"abstract":"Motion blur due to camera shake is an annoying yet common problem in low-light photography.

However, in the feature quantization process of sparse coding, some similar local features may be quantized into different visual words of the codebook due to the sensitiveness of quantization. In this paper, to alleviate the impact of this problem, we propose a Laplacian sparse coding method, which will exploit the dependence among the local features. Specifically, we propose to use histogram intersection based kNN method to construct a Laplacian matrix, which can well characterize the similarity of local features. In addition, we incorporate this Laplacian matrix into the objective function of sparse coding to preserve the consistence in sparse representation of similar local features. Comprehensive experimental results show that our method achieves or outperforms existing state-of-the-art results, and exhibits excellent performance on Scene 15 data set.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539943/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500709","htmlLink":"/document/5539943/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Local features are not lonely \u2013 Laplacian sparse coding for image classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local features are not lonely \u2013 Laplacian sparse coding for image classification","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4520478.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051981S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"265","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539943","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5539945,"authors":[{"name":"Manuel Werlberger","affiliation":["Institute for Computer Graphics and Vision"],"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Werlberger","id":"37541415400"},{"name":"Thomas Pock","affiliation":["Institute for Computer Graphics and Vision"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Pock","id":"37397716500"},{"name":"Horst Bischof","affiliation":["Institute for Computer Graphics and Vision"],"firstName":"Horst","lastName":"Bischof","id":"37270621900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539945","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":126,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1362},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539945","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion estimation with non-local total variation regularization","abstract":"State-of-the-art motion estimation algorithms suffer from three major problems: Poorly textured regions, occlusions and small scale image structures.

This is a significant improvement over standard BP inference, and extends the range of methods that are computationally tractable. In particular, when pair-wise potentials are Gaussians, the time complexity of DDMSBP becomes bilinear in the numbers of states and nodes in the MRF.

However, systems that perform well on particular datasets typically have one or more limitations such as a failure to generalize across visual tasks (e.g., requiring a face detector or extensive retuning of parameters), insufficient translation invariance, inability to cope with partial views and occlusion, or significant performance degradation as the number of classes is increased. Here we attempt to overcome these challenges using a model that combines sequential visual attention using fixations with sparse coding. The model's biologically-inspired filters are acquired using unsupervised learning applied to natural image patches. Using only a single feature type, our approach achieves 78.5% accuracy on Caltech-101 and 75.2% on the 102 Flowers dataset when trained on 30 instances per class and it achieves 92.7% accuracy on the AR Face database with 1 training instance per person. The same features and parameters are used across these datasets to illustrate its robust performance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539947.pdf","endPage":"2479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust classification of objects, faces, and flowers using natural image statistics","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539947","startPage":"2472","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539947","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Robust classification of objects, faces, and flowers using natural image statistics","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539947/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11500712","publicationDate":"June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5539947/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust classification of objects, faces, and flowers using natural image statistics","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"314_0928.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060556S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539947","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5539948,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Bilal Ashraf","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmed Bilal","lastName":"Ashraf","id":"37390936600"},{"name":"Simon Lucey","affiliation":["Commonwealth Science and Industrial Research Organisation, Australia"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Lucey","id":"37266130100"},{"name":"Tsuhan Chen","affiliation":["Cornell University, USA"],"firstName":"Tsuhan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37276683300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539948","dbTime":"44 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":586},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filter bank","Gabor filters","Matched filters","Lighting","Robustness","Image matching","Pixel","Sparse matrices","Computational efficiency","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","Fourier transforms","image matching","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast image alignment","gradient descent image alignment","template image","intensity pixels","complex 2D Fourier domain","2D spatial domain","sparse diagonal weighting matrix","inverse compositional form","Fourier transform","filter bank preprocessing","gradient descent image matching","robust image matching"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we propose a framework for gradient descent image alignment in the Fourier domain. Specifically, we propose an extension to the classical Lucas & Kanade (LK) algorithm where we represent the source and template image's intensity pixels in the complex 2D Fourier domain rather than in the 2D spatial domain. We refer to this approach as the Fourier LK (FLK) algorithm. The FLK formulation is especially advantageous, over traditional LK, when it comes to pre-processing the source and template images with a bank of filters (e.g., Gabor filters) as: (i) it can handle substantial illumination variations, (ii) the inefficient pre-processing filter bank step can be subsumed within the FLK algorithm as a sparse diagonal weighting matrix, (iii) unlike traditional LK the computational cost is invariant to the number of filters and as a result far more efficient, (iv) this approach can be extended to the inverse compositional form of the LK algorithm where nearly all steps (including Fourier transform and filter bank pre-processing) can be pre-computed leading to an extremely efficient and robust approach to gradient descent image matching. We demonstrate robust image matching performance on a variety of objects in the presence of substantial illumination differences with exactly the same computational overhead as that of traditional inverse compositional LK during fitting.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539948","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539948.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","startPage":"2480","endPage":"2487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast image alignment in the Fourier domain","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539948","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast image alignment in the Fourier domain","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539948/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500713","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5539948/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast image alignment in the Fourier domain","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3150961.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128727S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5539949,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Vedaldi","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, UK"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Vedaldi","id":"37398040100"},{"name":"Andrew Zisserman","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, UK"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Zisserman","id":"37266140000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539949","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":143,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":586},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Testing","Support vector machines","Learning systems","Computer vision","Probability distribution","Histograms","Sampling methods","Large-scale systems","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","Fourier analysis","self-organising feature maps","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient additive kernels","explicit feature map","intersection kernel","nonlinear intersection kernel","computer vision","finite-dimensional feature maps","Fourier sampling theorem","SVM implementations","Hellinger kernel"]}],"abstract":"Maji and Berg have recently introduced an explicit feature map approximating the intersection kernel.

However, the seemingly straight-forward task of estimating spatially-varying blur from a single image has proved hard to accomplish reliably. This work considers such blur and makes two contributions: a local blur cue that measures the likelihood of a small neighborhood being blurred by a candidate blur kernel; and an algorithm that, given an image, simultaneously selects a motion blur kernel and segments the region that it affects. The methods are shown to perform well on a diversity of images.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539954.pdf","startPage":"2512","endPage":"2519","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analyzing spatially-varying blur","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Image segmentation","Layout","Pixel","Cameras","Sea measurements","Motion measurement","Degradation","Image analysis","Information analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image motion analysis","image restoration","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatially-varying blur analysis","multiple scene points","object motion","image plane","candidate blur kernel","motion blur kernel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539954/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Analyzing spatially-varying blur","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5539954/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500719","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing spatially-varying blur","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3191525.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054024S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5539955,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois,  Urbana Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404549600"},{"name":"David Forsyth","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois,  Urbana Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Forsyth","id":"37269801900"},{"name":"Derek Hoiem","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois,  Urbana Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Derek","lastName":"Hoiem","id":"37282746800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539955","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":337},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539955","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Humans","Birds","Computer science","Management training","Object recognition","Leg","Computer vision","Extraterrestrial measurements","Clouds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["comparative object similarity","learning models","object recognition","intrinsic long-tailed distribution","object categories","regularized kernel machine algorithm","category dependent similarity regularization"]}],"abstract":"Learning models for recognizing objects with few or no training examples is important, due to the intrinsic long-tailed distribution of objects in the real world. In this paper, we propose an approach to use comparative object similarity. The key insight is that: given a set of object categories which are similar and a set of categories which are dissimilar, a good object model should respond more strongly to examples from similar categories than to examples from dissimilar categories. We develop a regularized kernel machine algorithm to use this category dependent similarity regularization. Our experiments on hundreds of categories show that our method can make significant improvement, especially for categories with no examples.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539955","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539955.pdf","startPage":"3525","endPage":"3532","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539955","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative object similarity for improved recognition with few or no examples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Comparative object similarity for improved recognition with few or no examples","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5539955/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500720","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539955/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative object similarity for improved recognition with few or no examples","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4480136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058515S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539955","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5539957,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew D.

We present a learning framework where features that capture these mid-level cues spontaneously emerge from image data. Our approach is based on the convolutional decomposition of images under a spar-sity constraint and is totally unsupervised.

The oldest and simplest correlation filters use simple templates and generally fail when applied to tracking. More modern approaches such as ASEF and UMACE perform better, but their training needs are poorly suited to tracking. Visual tracking requires robust filters to be trained from a single frame and dynamically adapted as the appearance of the target object changes. This paper presents a new type of correlation filter, a Minimum Output Sum of Squared Error (MOSSE) filter, which produces stable correlation filters when initialized using a single frame. A tracker based upon MOSSE filters is robust to variations in lighting, scale, pose, and nonrigid deformations while operating at 669 frames per second. Occlusion is detected based upon the peak-to-sidelobe ratio, which enables the tracker to pause and resume where it left off when the object reappears.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539960","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539960.pdf","startPage":"2544","endPage":"2550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual object tracking using adaptive correlation filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Visual object tracking using adaptive correlation filters","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5539960/","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500722","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539960/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual object tracking using adaptive correlation filters","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"323_1905.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07003S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"1364","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539960","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":5539962,"authors":[{"name":"Marc'Aurelio Ranzato","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Marc'Aurelio","lastName":"Ranzato","id":"37891706700"},{"name":"Geoffrey E.

Previous work on learning such models has focused on methods in which the latent features are used to determine the mean and variance of each pixel independently, or on methods in which the hidden units determine the covariance matrix of a zero-mean Gaussian distribution. In this work, we propose a probabilistic model that combines these two approaches into a single framework. We represent each image using one set of binary latent features that model the image-specific covariance and a separate set that model the mean. We show that this approach provides a probabilistic framework for the widely used simple-cell complex-cell architecture, it produces very realistic samples of natural images and it extracts features that yield state-of-the-art recognition accuracy on the challenging CIFAR 10 dataset.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539962/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500727","htmlLink":"/document/5539962/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modeling pixel means and covariances using factorized third-order boltzmann machines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling pixel means and covariances using factorized third-order boltzmann machines","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3242017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095434S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5539963,"authors":[{"name":"Y-Lan Boureau","affiliation":["INRIA, France","Courant Institute, New York University, USA","Laboratoire d'Informatique de l'Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, ENS/INRIA/CNRS UMR 8548, France"],"firstName":"Y-Lan","lastName":"Boureau","id":"37546991000"},{"name":"Francis Bach","affiliation":["INRIA, France","Laboratoire d'Informatique de l'Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, ENS/INRIA/CNRS UMR 8548, France"],"firstName":"Francis","lastName":"Bach","id":"37281561400"},{"name":"Yann LeCun","affiliation":["Courant Institute, New York University, USA"],"firstName":"Yann","lastName":"LeCun","id":"37282875900"},{"name":"Jean Ponce","affiliation":["Ecole Normale Sup\u00e8rieure, France"],"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Ponce","id":"37282647000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539963","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":555,"citationCountPatent":12,"totalDownloads":5031},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vector quantization","Dictionaries","Convolutional codes","Feature extraction","Image coding","Layout","Object recognition","Gabor filters","Image classification","Image representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","Gabor filters","learning (artificial intelligence)","object recognition","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mid level features learning","object recognition","low level descriptors","Gabor filter responses","SIFT descriptors","coding step","pointwise transformation","pooling step","feature extraction","vector quantization","sparse coding"]}],"abstract":"Many successful models for scene or object recognition transform low-level descriptors (such as Gabor filter responses, or SIFT descriptors) into richer representations of intermediate complexity. This process can often be broken down into two steps: (1) a coding step, which performs a pointwise transformation of the descriptors into a representation better adapted to the task, and (2) a pooling step, which summarizes the coded features over larger neighborhoods. Several combinations of coding and pooling schemes have been proposed in the literature. The goal of this paper is threefold. We seek to establish the relative importance of each step of mid-level feature extraction through a comprehensive cross evaluation of several types of coding modules (hard and soft vector quantization, sparse coding) and pooling schemes (by taking the average, or the maximum), which obtains state-of-the-art performance or better on several recognition benchmarks. We show how to improve the best performing coding scheme by learning a supervised discriminative dictionary for sparse coding. We provide theoretical and empirical insight into the remarkable performance of max pooling. By teasing apart components shared by modern mid-level feature extractors, our approach aims to facilitate the design of better recognition architectures.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539963","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539963.pdf","startPage":"2559","endPage":"2566","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning mid-level features for recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539963","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539963/","displayDocTitle":"Learning mid-level features for recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500728","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5539963/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning mid-level features for recognition","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3252057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08679S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"555","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539963","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":5539964,"authors":[{"name":"Ignacio Ramirez","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, USA"],"firstName":"Ignacio","lastName":"Ramirez","id":"37411078700"},{"name":"Pablo Sprechmann","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, USA"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Sprechmann","id":"37294228000"},{"name":"Guillermo Sapiro","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, USA"],"firstName":"Guillermo","lastName":"Sapiro","id":"37274814000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539964","dbTime":"29 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":447,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":8386},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539964","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Atomic measurements","Robustness","Clustering algorithms","Signal processing algorithms","Image reconstruction","Speech","Linear approximation","Art","Image restoration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dictionary learning","structured incoherence","shared features","clustering framework","sparse modeling","discrete points","sparse coding","learned dictionary","sparse representation","\u21131 regularization term","unsupervised classification","spectral clustering","low dimensional eigen-decomposition problem"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539964","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539964.pdf","startPage":"3501","endPage":"3508","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification and clustering via dictionary learning with structured incoherence and shared features","abstract":"A clustering framework within the sparse modeling and dictionary learning setting is introduced in this work. Instead of searching for the set of centroid that best fit the data, as in k-means type of approaches that model the data as distributions around discrete points, we optimize for a set of dictionaries, one for each cluster, for which the signals are best reconstructed in a sparse coding manner. Thereby, we are modeling the data as a union of learned low dimensional subspaces, and data points associated to subspaces spanned by just a few atoms of the same learned dictionary are clustered together. An incoherence promoting term encourages dictionaries associated to different classes to be as independent as possible, while still allowing for different classes to share features. This term directly acts on the dictionaries, thereby being applicable both in the supervised and unsupervised settings. Using learned dictionaries for classification and clustering makes this method robust and well suited to handle large datasets. The proposed framework uses a novel measurement for the quality of the sparse representation, inspired by the robustness of the \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n regularization term in sparse coding. In the case of unsupervised classification and/or clustering, a new initialization based on combining sparse coding with spectral clustering is proposed. This initialization clusters the dictionary atoms, and therefore is based on solving a low dimensional eigen-decomposition problem, being applicable to large datasets. We first illustrate the proposed framework with examples on standard image and speech datasets in the supervised classification setting, obtaining results comparable to the state-of-the-art with this simple approach. We then present experiments for fully unsupervised clustering on extended standard datasets and texture images, obtaining excellent performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539964/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11500729","publicationDate":"June 2010","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5539964/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Classification and clustering via dictionary learning with structured incoherence and shared features","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification and clustering via dictionary learning with structured incoherence and shared features","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4451037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090636S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"447","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5539965,"authors":[{"name":"Hakan Cevikalp","affiliation":["Eskisehir Osmangazi University, Eskisehir, Turkey"],"firstName":"Hakan","lastName":"Cevikalp","id":"37275726600"},{"name":"Bill Triggs","affiliation":["Laboratoire Jean Kuntzmann, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Bill","lastName":"Triggs","id":"37282698000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539965","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":307,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2195},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Surveillance","Vectors","Image recognition","Solid modeling","Lighting","Testing","Robustness","Kernel","Image retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","face recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image sets","similarity metric","linear feature space","affine feature space","convex geometric region","set dissimilarity","geometric distance","feature mapping"]}],"abstract":"We introduce a novel method for face recognition from image sets. In our setting each test and training example is a set of images of an individual's face, not just a single image, so recognition decisions need to be based on comparisons of image sets. Methods for this have two main aspects: the models used to represent the individual image sets; and the similarity metric used to compare the models. Here, we represent images as points in a linear or affine feature space and characterize each image set by a convex geometric region (the affine or convex hull) spanned by its feature points. Set dissimilarity is measured by geometric distances (distances of closest approach) between convex models. To reduce the influence of outliers we use robust methods to discard input points that are far from the fitted model. The kernel trick allows the approach to be extended to implicit feature mappings, thus handling complex and nonlinear manifolds of face images. Experiments on two public face datasets show that our proposed methods outperform a number of existing state-of-the-art ones.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face recognition based on image sets","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539965","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539965.pdf","startPage":"2567","endPage":"2573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539965","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539965/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Face recognition based on image sets","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5539965/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500730","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face recognition based on image sets","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3260900.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049307S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"307","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539965","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5539967,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-Tong Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xiao-Tong","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37536286000"},{"name":"Shuicheng Yan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Shuicheng","lastName":"Yan","id":"37272225300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539967","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":206,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2187},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Kernel","Face recognition","Testing","Feature extraction","Linear regression","Machine learning","Optimization methods","Acceleration","Gradient methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","image classification","image representation","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual classification","multitask joint sparse representation","multiple kernel-based representations","supervised visual recognition applications","multitask joint covariate selection model","proximal gradient method","face recognition"]}],"abstract":"We address the problem of computing joint sparse representation of visual signal across multiple kernel-based representations.

Furthermore, two kernel-view extensions of this method are provided to handle the situations where descriptors and similarity functions are in the form of kernel matrices. We then investigate into two applications of our algorithm to feature combination: 1) fusing gray-level and LBP features for face recognition, and 2) combining multiple kernels for object categorization.

In principle, therefore, using ears in addition to the face within a recognition system could improve accuracy and robustness, particularly for non-frontal views. The paper describes work that investigates this hypothesis using an approach based on the construction of a 3D morphable model of the head and ear. One issue with creating a model that includes the ear is that existing training datasets contain noise and partial occlusion. Rather than exclude these regions manually, a classifier has been developed which automates this process. When combined with a robust registration algorithm the resulting system enables full head morphable models to be constructed efficiently using less constrained datasets. The algorithm has been evaluated using registration consistency, model coverage and minimalism metrics, which together demonstrate the accuracy of the approach. To make it easier to build on this work, the source code has been made available online.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539968","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539968.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","startPage":"2582","endPage":"2589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D morphable model construction for robust ear and face recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"3D morphable model construction for robust ear and face recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539968/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500733","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5539968/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D morphable model construction for robust ear and face recognition","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3281328.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047412S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539968","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5539970,"authors":[{"name":"Jianxiong Xiao","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Jianxiong","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37404395100"},{"name":"James Hays","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA","Brown University, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Hays","id":"37410626800"},{"name":"Krista A.

Among the methods proposed to date, personalized age estimation methods generally outperform global age estimation methods by learning a separate age estimator for each person in the training data set. However, since typical age databases only contain very limited training data for each person, training a separate age estimator using only training data for that person runs a high risk of overfitting the data and hence the prediction performance is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to age estimation by formulating the problem as a multi-task learning problem. Based on a variant of the Gaussian process (GP) called warped Gaussian process (WGP), we propose a multi-task extension called multi-task warped Gaussian process (MTWGP). Age estimation is formulated as a multi-task regression problem in which each learning task refers to estimation of the age function for each person. While MTWGP models common features shared by different tasks (persons), it also allows task-specific (person-specific) features to be learned automatically. Moreover, unlike previous age estimation methods which need to specify the form of the regression functions or determine many parameters in the functions using inefficient methods such as cross validation, the form of the regression functions in MTWGP is implicitly defined by the kernel function and all its model parameters can be learned from data automatically. We have conducted experiments on two publicly available age databases, FG-NET and MORPH. The experimental results are very promising in showing that MTWGP compares favorably with state-of-the-art age estimation methods.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539975","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539975.pdf","startPage":"2622","endPage":"2629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-task warped Gaussian process for personalized age estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539975","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539975/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-task warped Gaussian process for personalized age estimation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500741","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5539975/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-task warped Gaussian process for personalized age estimation","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3330760.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058735S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539975","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5539982,"authors":[{"name":"Dengxin Dai","affiliation":["Signal Processing Lab, Wuhan University, China","Lotus Hill Research Institute (LHI), Ezhou, China"],"firstName":"Dengxin","lastName":"Dai","id":"37531409100"},{"name":"Tianfu Wu","affiliation":["Lotus Hill Research Institute (LHI), Ezhou, China","Department of Statistics, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), USA"],"firstName":"Tianfu","lastName":"Wu","id":"37401820300"},{"name":"Song-Chun Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Statistics, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), USA","Lotus Hill Research Institute (LHI), Ezhou, China","Department of Statistics, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), USA"],"firstName":"Song-Chun","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37281407500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539982","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":227},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Layout","Sampling methods","Bayesian methods","Image sampling","Stochastic processes","Solid modeling","Deformable models","Clustering algorithms","Space exploration","Signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","feature extraction","graph theory","image sampling","pattern clustering","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian framework","graph partition problem","automatic feature selection","unsupervised scene categorization","cluster sampling","information projection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539982","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539982.pdf","startPage":"3455","endPage":"3462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discovering scene categories by information projection and cluster sampling","abstract":"This paper presents a method for unsupervised scene categorization.

Different from traditional face recognition approaches which represent each facial image by a single feature vector as the classification problem, the proposed method establishes a new way to formulate the face recognition problem as a deformable image registration problem. The main contributions of the paper lie in the following aspects: (i) Each pixel is represented by an anatomical feature signature calculated from its corresponding best scale salient region by using a new salient region detector based on the survival exponential entropy (SEE); (ii) The face recognition problem is formulated as a deformable image registration problem, the deformation model is represented by a Markov random field (MRF) labeling framework. Explicit pixel correspondence is established by the deformation framework. (iii) The survival exponential entropy based normalized mutual information (SEE-NMI) is proposed and integrated with the MRF based deformation model as the similarity measure to reflect the similarity between two facial images. The proposed method is evaluated on the FERET and FRGC version 2 databases and compared with several state-of-the-art face recognition approaches. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the highest recognition rate among all the compared approaches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel Markov random field based deformable model for face recognition","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539986","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539986.pdf","startPage":"2675","endPage":"2682","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539986","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539986/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"A novel Markov random field based deformable model for face recognition","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5539986/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500751","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel Markov random field based deformable model for face recognition","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3401240.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124901S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539986","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5539989,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Zhang","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37534507400"},{"name":"Baoxin Li","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Baoxin","lastName":"Li","id":"37292487900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539989","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":700,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":8485},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discriminative K-SVD for dictionary learning in face recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539989.pdf","startPage":"2691","endPage":"2698","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539989","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Face recognition","Databases","Iterative algorithms","Image coding","Optimization methods","Image recognition","Computer vision","Face detection","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","learning (artificial intelligence)","optimisation","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discriminative K-SVD","dictionary learning","sparse representation based face recognition","over complete dictionary","linear classifier","optimization","D-KSVD","YaleB database","AR database"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539989","abstract":"In a sparse-representation-based face recognition scheme, the desired dictionary should have good representational power (i.e., being able to span the subspace of all faces) while supporting optimal discrimination of the classes (i.e., different human subjects). We propose a method to learn an over-complete dictionary that attempts to simultaneously achieve the above two goals. The proposed method, discriminative K-SVD (D-KSVD), is based on extending the K-SVD algorithm by incorporating the classification error into the objective function, thus allowing the performance of a linear classifier and the representational power of the dictionary being considered at the same time by the same optimization procedure. The D-KSVD algorithm finds the dictionary and solves for the classifier using a procedure derived from the K-SVD algorithm, which has proven efficiency and performance. This is in contrast to most existing work that relies on iteratively solving sub-problems with the hope of achieving the global optimal through iterative approximation. We evaluate the proposed method using two commonly-used face databases, the Extended YaleB database and the AR database, with detailed comparison to 3 alternative approaches, including the leading state-of-the-art in the literature. The experiments show that the proposed method outperforms these competing methods in most of the cases. Further, using Fisher criterion and dictionary incoherence, we also show that the learned dictionary and the corresponding classifier are indeed better-posed to support sparse-representation-based recognition.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539989/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500755","htmlLink":"/document/5539989/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Discriminative K-SVD for dictionary learning in face recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminative K-SVD for dictionary learning in face recognition","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3421466.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054564S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"700","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539989","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":5539990,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Su","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, China","Digital Media Research Center,  Institute of Computing Technology, CAS, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Su","id":"37534941700"},{"name":"Shiguang Shan","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Shiguang","lastName":"Shan","id":"37271963900"},{"name":"Xilin Chen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Xilin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37278215600"},{"name":"Wen Gao","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Media, Peking University, China","School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Gao","id":"37275735100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539990","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":81,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":797},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Principal component analysis","Linear discriminant analysis","Computer science","Content addressable storage","Laboratories","Deductive databases","Information processing","Scattering","Image databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","matrix algebra","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive generic learning","face recognition","single sample per person","single training sample","discriminatory information","generic discriminant model","coupled linear representation","within-class scatter matrix","Fisher linear discriminant","FERET"]}],"abstract":"Real-world face recognition systems often have to face the single sample per person (SSPP) problem, that is, only a single training sample for each person is enrolled in the database. In this case, many of the popular face recognition methods fail to work well due to the inability to learn the discriminatory information specific to the persons to be identified. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive Generic Learning (AGL) method, which adapts a generic discriminant model to better distinguish the persons with single face sample. As a specific implementation of the AGL, a Coupled Linear Representation (CLR) algorithm is proposed to infer, based on the generic training set, the within-class scatter matrix and the class mean of each person given its single enrolled sample. Thus, the traditional Fisher's Linear Discriminant (FLD) can be applied to SSPP task. Experiments on the FERET and a challenging passport face database show that the proposed method can achieve better results compared with other common solutions to the SSPP problem.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive generic learning for face recognition from a single sample per person","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539990","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539990.pdf","startPage":"2699","endPage":"2706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539990","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539990/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive generic learning for face recognition from a single sample per person","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5539990/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500756","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive generic learning for face recognition from a single sample per person","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3431611.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062725S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5539992,"authors":[{"name":"Zhimin Cao","affiliation":["Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Zhimin","lastName":"Cao","id":"37534102400"},{"name":"Qi Yin","affiliation":["Institute for Theoretical Computer Science,  ITCS, Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Yin","id":"37531007900"},{"name":"Xiaoou Tang","affiliation":["Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoou","lastName":"Tang","id":"37280008500"},{"name":"Jian Sun","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Sun","id":"37407525400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539992","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":268,"citationCountPatent":16,"totalDownloads":3324},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Encoding","Histograms","Principal component analysis","Robustness","Face detection","Unsupervised learning","Design methodology","Asia","Lighting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image coding","image matching","image representation","principal component analysis","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","learning-based descriptor","representation issue","matching issue","learning-based encoding method","unsupervised learning techniques","principal component analysis","compact face descriptor","normalization mechanism","face representation","labeled face in wild benchmark","pose-adaptive matching method"]}],"abstract":"We present a novel approach to address the representation issue and the matching issue in face recognition (verification). Firstly, our approach encodes the micro-structures of the face by a new learning-based encoding method. Unlike many previous manually designed encoding methods (e.g., LBP or SIFT), we use unsupervised learning techniques to learn an encoder from the training examples, which can automatically achieve very good tradeoff between discriminative power and invariance. Then we apply PCA to get a compact face descriptor. We find that a simple normalization mechanism after PCA can further improve the discriminative ability of the descriptor. The resulting face representation, learning-based (LE) descriptor, is compact, highly discriminative, and easy-to-extract. To handle the large pose variation in real-life scenarios, we propose a pose-adaptive matching method that uses pose-specific classifiers to deal with different pose combinations (e.g., frontal v.s. frontal, frontal v.s. left) of the matching face pair. Our approach is comparable with the state-of-the-art methods on the Labeled Face in Wild (LFW) benchmark (we achieved 84.45% recognition rate), while maintaining excellent compactness, simplicity, and generalization aability across different datasets.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539992","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539992.pdf","startPage":"2707","endPage":"2714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539992","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face recognition with learning-based descriptor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539992","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539992/","displayDocTitle":"Face recognition with learning-based descriptor","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500754","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5539992/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face recognition with learning-based descriptor","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3441625.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061886S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"268","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539992","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5539994,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406469100"},{"name":"Sanjiv Kumar","affiliation":["Google Research, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Sanjiv","lastName":"Kumar","id":"38183554700"},{"name":"Shih-Fu Chang","affiliation":["Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Shih-Fu","lastName":"Chang","id":"37281064000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539994","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":344,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":2234},"abstract":"Large scale image search has recently attracted considerable attention due to easy availability of huge amounts of data. Several hashing methods have been proposed to allow approximate but highly efficient search. Unsupervised hashing methods show good performance with metric distances but, in image search, semantic similarity is usually given in terms of labeled pairs of images. There exist supervised hashing methods that can handle such semantic similarity but they are prone to overfitting when labeled data is small or noisy. Moreover, these methods are usually very slow to train. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised hashing method that is formulated as minimizing empirical error on the labeled data while maximizing variance and independence of hash bits over the labeled and unlabeled data. The proposed method can handle both metric as well as semantic similarity. The experimental results on two large datasets (up to one million samples) demonstrate its superior performance over state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539994.pdf","startPage":"3424","endPage":"3431","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539994","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539994","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-supervised hashing for scalable image retrieval","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image retrieval","Large-scale systems","Image databases","Information retrieval","Videos","Nearest neighbor searches","Binary codes","Availability","YouTube","Scalability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["file organisation","image retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable image retrieval","large scale image search","unsupervised hashing method","semantic similarity","semi-supervised hashing method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Semi-supervised hashing for scalable image retrieval","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5539994/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500759","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-supervised hashing for scalable image retrieval","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4351427.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063082S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"344","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":5539995,"authors":[{"name":"G.

During subject enrollment, we build subject-specific 3D annotated models by using the subjects' raw 3D data and 2D texture. During authentication, the probe 2D images are projected onto a normalized image space using the subject-specific 3D model in the gallery. Then, a bidirectional relighting algorithm and two similarity metrics (a view-dependent complex wavelet structural similarity and a global similarity) are employed to compare the gallery and probe. We tested our algorithms on the UHDB11 and UHDB12 databases that contain 3D data with probe images under large lighting and pose variations. The experimental results show the robustness of our approach in recognizing faces in difficult situations.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539995","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539995.pdf","startPage":"2721","endPage":"2728","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bidirectional relighting for 3D-aided 2D face recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539995","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539995/","displayDocTitle":"Bidirectional relighting for 3D-aided 2D face recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500760","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5539995/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bidirectional relighting for 3D-aided 2D face recognition","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3461714.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062836S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539995","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5539996,"authors":[{"name":"Michel Valstar","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, UK"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"Valstar","id":"37273160600"},{"name":"Brais Martinez","affiliation":["ICT Department, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Spain"],"firstName":"Brais","lastName":"Martinez","id":"37286111600"},{"name":"Xavier Binefa","affiliation":["ICT Department, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Spain"],"firstName":"Xavier","lastName":"Binefa","id":"37294897700"},{"name":"Maja Pantic","affiliation":["Department of Computing,  EEMCS, Imperial College London, UK"],"firstName":"Maja","lastName":"Pantic","id":"37273162000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6985-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6983-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5539996","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":190,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1530},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face detection","Detectors","Facial features","Mouth","Active shape model","Gabor filters","Educational institutions","Feature extraction","Markov random fields","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational geometry","face recognition","feature extraction","graph theory","Markov processes","regression analysis","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["facial point detection","boosted regression","graph models","fiducial facial points","geometric-feature-based facial expression analysis","appearance-based features extraction","support vector regression","Markov random fields"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5539996","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539996","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","abstract":"Finding fiducial facial points in any frame of a video showing rich naturalistic facial behaviour is an unsolved problem. Yet this is a crucial step for geometric-feature-based facial expression analysis, and methods that use appearance-based features extracted at fiducial facial point locations. In this paper we present a method based on a combination of Support Vector Regression and Markov Random Fields to drastically reduce the time needed to search for a point's location and increase the accuracy and robustness of the algorithm. Using Markov Random Fields allows us to constrain the search space by exploiting the constellations that facial points can form. The regressors on the other hand learn a mapping between the appearance of the area surrounding a point and the positions of these points, which makes detection of the points very fast and can make the algorithm robust to variations of appearance due to facial expression and moderate changes in head pose. The proposed point detection algorithm was tested on 1855 images, the results of which showed we outperform current state of the art point detectors.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5539770","startPage":"2729","endPage":"2736","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5521876/5539770/05539996.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Facial point detection using boosted regression and graph models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5539996/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5539996/","displayDocTitle":"Facial point detection using boosted regression and graph models","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11500761","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Facial point detection using boosted regression and graph models","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3471767.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081103S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5521876","isNumber":"5539770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5521876","citationCount":"190","xplore-issue":"5539770","articleId":"5539996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"}]
